The clever multi-chamber system saves you from turning over the compost and features large filling and removal flaps with Snap-On wind protection. This compost bin has adjustable ventilation for air control in summer and winter. The Aero plus 6000 features composting in 3 stages. In the 1st stage, food and garden waste is collected and mixed with only low ventilation (anaerobic). This has proved to prevent from annoying insects like wasps and flies and to bring a greater mass of waste at one time to the 2nd stage by opening the discharge flap. In the 2nd stage it is digested rapidly with generous ventilation, generating heat up to 70 degrees c (158 f), thereby destroying weeds. Here, the waste looses a lot of volume, so the 2nd stage has a capacity of approximately 3x that of the first cabin. When the 2nd stage is filled, it is very comfortably moved to the 3rd stage, at the same time mixed and aerated by the turning the outside handle which turns the shelf. In the 3rd stage, the digested and cooled down compost is maturing in intense contact with earth and the myriads of useful organisms therein. As new waste is separated from mature compost by the 3-stage system and due to the turning bottom, the mature compost is not compressed - removal is clean & easy through the two large discharge flaps/doors on opposite sides at the bottom camber of the composter. The Aero plus 6000 is the winner of the red dot design award and best of the best in 2013. 2 year warranty. Measures 31.1 X 31.1 X 43.3 Inches. Made by Juwel in Austria.\"", "label": 0}

Available in a multitude of flavors including pure and blended mixtures Made in the USA\" COL description VAL \"We are an actual manufacturing plant that uses real trees and processes them into our products. We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

NOTE: These will not work with the new bottles with the eco-friendly shorter caps. The threads on the new bottles are too short to reach the bottom of the waterer.

THE SHORTER THREADED ECO-FRIENDLY BOTTLES DO NOT WORK. I have used hanging water cups for many years on my farm. The advantages I see to the hanging water cups is that they stay cleaner because my chickens aren't as prone to kick dirt in them and earth worms don't crawl into them and die. Water & Feed bowls sitting on the ground can also become a home for vermin & insects. I have a lot of movable pens that I try to keep on fresh grass, and it is a lot easier if the cup is hanging on the pen. Fresh Clean Water = Healthy, Hydrated, Happy animals.

It is a highly effective Deicer & Preventer in temperatures up to -40. It will last longer and require fewer applications then other brands found at retail stores. <br> <b>Directions:</b> <br> <b>Liquid Deicer:</b> Spray or pour onto Snow or Ice accumulations at a rate of 1 to 3 gallons per 1000 SF. This fluid works best when applied in narrow bands to minimize dilution from melting. This liquid ice melt will penetrate to the pavement to break the bonds of ice and snow prior to mechanical removal. <br> <b>Aid to Solid Deicers:</b> Liquid ice melt is also used as an aid to solid deicers in heavy ice situations. A solid deicer is first applied to punch holes in the ice, Then this product is applied over the top which will penetrate the holes to the surface breaking the ice to pavement bond so mechanical removal can be easily accomplished. <br> <b>Ice Prevention:</b> Treating surfaces before snow & ice occur will form a high traction film to prevent adhesion of ice and snow, which is then mechanically removed. Apply at a rate of 1/2 to 1 Gallon per 1000 SF. <br> <b>Pre-Wetting Agent:</b> Use as pre-wetter for solid ice melt products. Because this liquid ice melt has a very low freezing point it significantly improves the performance of solids and does not clog spray nozzles. Salt and other granular ice melts need moisture to start working. Many granular ice melters can not begin melting snow and ice in very low temperatures.

Year Round Production Odor Free Operation Expandable up to 7 trays\" COL description VAL \"Worm composting is an incredibly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for your garden. Master gardeners agree that compost produced by worms will produce the best results and help your plants thrive. The Worm Factory's unique stackable, multi-tray design makes it the most efficient worm bin composter around. Worms begin eating waste in the lowest tray, and then migrate upward as food sources in that tray are exhausted. By allowing worms to migrate upward, the worms separate themselves from the finished compost that is ready for the garden. Besides the worm castings that are produced through this process, the Worm Factory also produces a second type of compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through your Worm Factory, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer, know as leachate is gathered in the special collection tray of the Worm Factory and can easily be drained from the spigot. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrient rich compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system taking nutrient-rich particles with it. You can drain organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. It's compact square design gives the Worm Factory the smallest footprint of all worm composters. The Worm Factory's tray stacking system allows it to hold the largest capacity of compost in the smallest amount of space, making it the perfect composter for anyone with space limitations. The Worm Factory is simple to operate. When full, each tray weighs only 12.5 pounds making lifting and arranging trays effortless. The included 38-page instruction manual and instructional DVD makes setup fast and easy and gives tips on how to best manage your Worm Factory composter year-round.\"", "label": 0}

You can have the satisfaction of a product you made hanging in your yard for your friends and family to see. Not only having the a homemade kit hanging up, it also gives you the chance to enjoy having wildlife in your backyard! Comes with full instructions on assembly and mounting. Modeled after the design of owl expert Steve Simmons, this box meets the specific needs of the Barn Owl. The entrance hole is elliptical in shape to provide protection from predators including raccoons and Great Horned Owls. Additionally, there is an interior divider separating the box into two compartments. Should a predator be able to reach into the box, they will be unable to reach the owl or owlets on the other side of the divider. The entrance hole is also placed in consideration of young owlets in order to prevent them from being pushed out of the box by others behind them especially as they all seek to be fed first. Special \"grip\" grooves on the front of the box underneath the entrance hole helps the adult owl gain access to the box. No perches exist outside of the box as they could provide convenient perches for predators or for young owlets, thus exposing them to predators. A door on the end of the box allows for easy access to the interior - making clean out a simple and quick task. This also provides easy access to mount a wildlife camera in the box, so you can enjoy viewing your own young owlets during their growth process. This box design has proven very successful in attracting and providing homes to thousands of owls. Ranchers, farmers, and vineyards have found these useful for their own natural pest control.

This thoughtful, versatile, ultra-portable charcoal grill is designed with the revolutionary GrateLifter charcoal management system that allows you to maximize flavor while minimizing the difficulties associated with grilling with charcoal. So whether you are tailgating before the big game, camping under the stars, or entertaining friends and family at home, the Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill will help you serve up delicious barbecue every time. With a 240 square inch porcelain-coated grill grate, this spacious grill has plenty of room to accommodate lots of food at one time while still distributing heat evenly and efficiently. In addition, the handy integrated precision temperature gauge clearly displays internal temperatures and allows you to accurately manage your cooking. Weighing less than 30 pounds, the grill is ultra-portable -- easy to pack up and carry to any social venue where fine grilled food is on the menu. The grill measures 26 x 19 x 18 inches when in grilling mode. The Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill is designed for the serious chef and grillmaster -- one who understands that grilling over charcoal leads to the tastiest barbecue, and that using a quality charcoal grill will make all the difference. Highlighted by its colorful green enamel-coated steel lid and prominent integrated temperature gauge, the Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill promises to deliver exceptional quality that will withstand the elements and survive years of high-temperature grilling. Grilling with charcoal requires time, patience, and considerable interaction with your grill. To maximize food flavor and tenderness, the master chef must pay close attention to the temperature and understand when to make adjustments. It is both a science and an art... with most chefs having their own personal tactics to achieve the perfect flame. Yet no charcoal grills offer the ability to so easily adjust, add and remove coals as the Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill. The innovative GrateLifter mechanism is a novel cooking grate lifting system that gives the chef access to the charcoal bed without ever having to touch the dirty cooking grate. With the lift engaged, the grate raises effortlessly out of the way when you open the lid. This gives the chef easy, safe access to the coals beneath the grate, allowing you to add coals for extended cooking and adjust the location of the coals to help fine-tune direct heating temperatures. This also comes in handy when you want to smoke foods using indirect heating by letting you easily shift coals to the unused portion of the grill. All of this can now be accomplished without removing the cooking grate -- even when the grate is fully loaded and cooking! The new GrateLifter system also makes the process of lighting coals simple and clean. Simply light the coals in the firebox with the grate in place. When the coals are hot, use the Lift feature and spread the coals without removing the cooking grate. And when the coals turn to ash, use the Lift feature to raise the cooking grate and brush the ash into the ash tray. It's simple, easy, safe, and clean. The Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill combines the ideal size of a family charcoal grill with the versatility and compact size for the perfect portable grill. Its spacious 240 square inch grilling surface is ideal for cooking for your entire family, with enough space to cook up to 10 burgers, 8 steaks or 8 chicken breasts. The compact footprint also ensures that this grill will not take up too much space on your patio, like those larger, full-sized grills do. Two removable Cuisinart GrateLifter Side Tables (model number CST-152, sold separately) can provide extra shelf space and come in handy when grilling away from home. The grill fits comfortably on most patio tables, or docks on the Cuisinart Folding Grill Stand (model number CFGS-150, sold separately) for compact, upright grilling at full-size height. The Cuisinart All Foods Gas Grill Cover (model number CGC-21, sold separately) protects the grill when the grill is not in use. In addition, the GrateLifter is ultra-portable and designed to be the perfect size for all your on-the-go grilling.

We made a test for the turbo nozzle: we kept it working without any interrupt, and it worked only for 120 hours until it's dead because it generated a high temperature which ruined the turbo core.

MELTS & PREVENTS Ice, Frost & Snow NON TOXIC Safe for Pets WILL NOT harm vegetation or lawns NON STAINING Formula leaves no residue on floors\" COL description VAL \"This Concentrated Liquid Calcium Chloride is used for customers that need a fast acting product in extreme temperatures. It is a highly effective Deicer & Preventer in temperatures up to -40. It will last longer and require fewer applications then other brands found at retail stores. <br> <b>Directions:</b> <br> <b>Liquid Deicer:</b> Spray or pour onto Snow or Ice accumulations at a rate of 1 to 3 gallons per 1000 SF. This fluid works best when applied in narrow bands to minimize dilution from melting. This liquid ice melt will penetrate to the pavement to break the bonds of ice and snow prior to mechanical removal. <br> <b>Aid to Solid Deicers:</b> Liquid ice melt is also used as an aid to solid deicers in heavy ice situations. A solid deicer is first applied to punch holes in the ice, Then this product is applied over the top which will penetrate the holes to the surface breaking the ice to pavement bond so mechanical removal can be easily accomplished. <br> <b>Ice Prevention:</b> Treating surfaces before snow & ice occur will form a high traction film to prevent adhesion of ice and snow, which is then mechanically removed. Apply at a rate of 1/2 to 1 Gallon per 1000 SF. <br> <b>Pre-Wetting Agent:</b> Use as pre-wetter for solid ice melt products. Because this liquid ice melt has a very low freezing point it significantly improves the performance of solids and does not clog spray nozzles. Salt and other granular ice melts need moisture to start working. Many granular ice melters can not begin melting snow and ice in very low temperatures. By pre-wetting with this product, the liquid portion will begin melting snow immediately allowing the granular ice melts to do their job.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Plastic Roof Ice Guard Mini Snow Guard (25 Pack)Prevent Sliding Snow Ice Buildup-GREEN\" COL feature VAL \"Stop snow from sliding off your roof.

The Worm Factory 360 composting system makes the entire process quick and easy. With a thermo siphon air flow design, the Worm Factory 360 increases the composting speed. Now you can produce compost much faster than traditional composting methods. This version of the Worm Factory 360 comes in black, and it's also available in green and terracotta. Americans throw away 34 million tons of food waste into landfills each year, more than any other type of waste (EPA.gov). While traditional backyard composting has its place, the process can take up to two years and rotating it can become a chore. Worm composting uses worms to do the work of breaking down waste and is more efficient and easier to manage than a traditional backyard compost pile. In addition, its compact design makes it perfect for use in any household. Worm composting makes it easy to recycle kitchen scraps, paper waste and cardboard into nutrient-rich fertilizer for your plants, creating a more sustainable lifestyle by recycling and improving soil quality. The Worm Factory 360 houses thousands of composting worms in a compact space. These worms work 24/7 to efficiently produce highly beneficial, rich compost packed with microbes and water-soluble plant nutrients. This eliminates all the work of traditional composting and yields a much more valuable end product. Worm compost has been proven to have ten times the nutrients of traditional backyard compost. The more nutrients that are available to your plants, the larger they grow and the more bountiful your harvest is. This system allows you to enjoy <strong>organic</strong> vegetables, fruits, and flowers grown with the help of your kitchen scraps. &nbsp; The Worm Factory 360 is simple to set up and operate. Managing your Worm Factory 360 takes less than 15 minutes a week. Included with each Worm Factory 360 are a comprehensive instruction guide and DVD that make setup easy and give detailed tips on how to best manage your new Worm Factory 360 year-round. Start with just the bottom tray and bedding material included. Add 1lb of composting worms and start filling the tray with household waste. The worms will process and recycle the waste into fine compost full of nutrients. When the first tray is full, stack another on top. Each tray has a grid bottom, so worms migrate upward as new food is added. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This makes it possible to harvest organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. &nbsp; Adding household waste to the Worm Factory 360 is easy; just open the lid and toss the food in. Fruits, vegetables, grains, paper, eggshells, leaves, coffee grounds and more can be added. Three foods to avoid are diary, meat, and citrus items; these can be harmful to the worms and are difficult to compost. Feed your worms about 50 percent food scraps and 50 percent fiber and paper. This creates the optimal environment for worms and finished compost. The goal is to recycle what you usually throw away. Don't worry about feeding your worms every day. Some people feed them a handful a week; some people feed them a handful a day. The general rule of thumb is worms can eat about half their weight in food per day. This means that if you start with 1 pound of worms, they can eat a half pound of food per day. Worms can survive up to two weeks without any additional food. Just feed them a bit extra before going on long vacations. In a healthy environment, composting worms will maintain their population without over or under populating. &nbsp; Your waste production isn't seasonal and your composting efforts shouldn't be either! Composting is no longer limited to the warm months. The Worm Factory 360 can be used indoors or outdoors, allowing year round operation. When managed correctly, the Worm Factory 360 is odorless, making it the perfect composter for apartments, kitchens, condos, garages, porches and more! Because of its unique design, the Worm Factory 360 allows oxygen to flow through the system, discouraging stinky garbage odors. It is important to note that worms are living creatures, and cannot tolerate extreme temperatures. Keep the Worm Factory 360 so that the bedding remains between 40 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or where you would personally feel comfortable. The Worm Factory 360 is expandable vertically, allowing a high compost capacity while maintaining a very small footprint. When full, each tray weighs 12.5 pounds, making lifting and arranging trays effortless. &nbsp; Your first tray will take about three months to become fully composted by the worms. After the first tray is composted the other trays can take as little as a month depending on the waste added. Once you harvest your finished compost from the bottom tray, you will have an empty tray to stack on top again. The nutrient-rich finished compost can be used in your garden, raised beds, container gardens, or on houseplants. Even if you're not a gardener, the Worm Factory 360 helps you reduce your impact and provides an alternative to throwing your waste into the landfill. Worm compost not only adds vital nutrients to your soil, it also conditions the soil to hold water longer, prevent plant disease, and promote healthy root growth. Take one step in the green direction with the Worm Factory 360 and create a healthier, happier environment. &nbsp;  All models available in black, terracotta, and green\"", "label": 0}

(Additionally, if you want to ensure survival of your hedge, we have found that planting 3 starts in one hole is very effective in eliminating the occasional start that dies as they form one giant root ball.) best results, place them standing up in a bucket of 3-4 inches of water and keep watered). We call this the 'Jump-Start' technique and we will send you detailed instructions when you order. These starts come with other tried and tested instructions for optimum growth and survival. Still, if you don't want to go to the trouble, due to the nature of this unique tree you can plant them directly in the soil when you receive them as they do not need any roots or leaves to start.

Year Round Production Odor Free Operation Expandable up to 7 trays\" COL description VAL \"Worm composting is an incredibly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for your garden. Master gardeners agree that compost produced by worms will produce the best results and help your plants thrive. The Worm Factory's unique stackable, multi-tray design makes it the most efficient worm bin composter around. Worms begin eating waste in the lowest tray, and then migrate upward as food sources in that tray are exhausted. By allowing worms to migrate upward, the worms separate themselves from the finished compost that is ready for the garden. Besides the worm castings that are produced through this process, the Worm Factory also produces a second type of compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through your Worm Factory, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer, know as leachate is gathered in the special collection tray of the Worm Factory and can easily be drained from the spigot. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrient rich compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system taking nutrient-rich particles with it. You can drain organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. It's compact square design gives the Worm Factory the smallest footprint of all worm composters. The Worm Factory's tray stacking system allows it to hold the largest capacity of compost in the smallest amount of space, making it the perfect composter for anyone with space limitations. The Worm Factory is simple to operate. When full, each tray weighs only 12.5 pounds making lifting and arranging trays effortless. The included 38-page instruction manual and instructional DVD makes setup fast and easy and gives tips on how to best manage your Worm Factory composter year-round.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Amazing Rake Yellow 40 Gal.

The high-heat, fast-start wand can light charcoal briquettes, wood chips, chunks or pellets with ease. Two simple switches take your charcoal from cold to smoldering in a matter of minutes: the heat setting ignites, while the blow setting distributes the flames to unlit charcoal. The starter also has a built-in kickstand to prop the hot wand off of its resting surface. The wand's stainless steel tip has a higher melting point than other metals, allowing it to be buried directly into the coals, and its tapered tip focuses heat effectively. And once your coals are lit, you can even insert woodchips into the tip of the wand to heat the chips and blow smoky flavor directly onto your food. The Fire Up Charcoal Starter Wand is an excellent value as well. Get your charcoal started without breaking the bank. HOW TO USE: Plug in torch cord to a grounded electrical outlet (120V~, 1500W, 60Hz). Point nozzle directly at single piece of charcoal, no farther than 3 inches away. Flip switch to '1' to ignite the charcoal. Once charcoal is lit, flip switch to '2' to blow hot air onto the surrounding coals. If you are lighting a large amount of charcoal, consider igniting more than one charcoal to make sure the fire spreads evenly across your coals. After removing wand from the charcoal, unplug the wand and place it on its kickstand to cool. Let Starter Wand cool completely on a heat-safe surface before storing.

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory.

What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR?

Green Mine contains 16 important and naturally occurring trace elements. The wealth of biology, organic acids, carbon and humus make Green Mine the best product for your garden. Period. The science behind the magic starts with a well-balanced combination of <strong>Humic Acid</strong> and <strong>Fulvic Acid</strong> that helps plants absorb more nutrients more efficiently. These organic acids have proven to increase plant vitality and promote germination and fertility. Green Mine is highly water-soluble, meaning it breaks down quickly and is readily available, both systemically and in the soil, for plants to use. No product on the market goes to work more rapidly or effectively. GreenMine greatly improves your garden's soil structure by enriching it with good bacillus, fungi, organic nutrients and trace elements, providing a greater supply of nutrients, water and air in an environment that reduces the need for other fertilizers. The indigenous biology alone make Green Mine the best <strong>humic acid fertilizer</strong> on the market today.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"TeraVita 1 Lb SP-90 Humic Acid 100% Soluble Powder\" COL feature VAL \"1 Pound Resealable Bag TeraVita SP-90 is soluble humate powder (soluble salts of humic acids) that contains a minimum of 90% humic acids by dry weight. TeraVita SP-90 is 100% soluble in water. This enables the product to be applied dry or in a liquid form. When adding the powder to liquid tanks, thoroughly pre-mix the powder with water in a separate container before adding it to the final liquid tank. Derived from oxidized lignite (Leonardite)\" COL description VAL \"SP-90 is potassium humate powder that acts a natural soil and plant growth stimulant. It is a dark brown to black powder with an average 90% humic acid content. SP-90 is 99+% soluble in water. It is easily assimilated by plants and some of its main functions include improving plant immunity, improving plant metabolism, improving plant root development, improving the supply of plant nutritional elements and increasing the formation of ferments. SP-90 promotes the increased accumulation of chlorophyll, sugar, amino acids and more and improves the efficiency of nitrogen utilization, allowing for reduced fertilizer rates. One of the primary actions of SP-90 is to increase the plants ability to withstand the stresses of heat, drought, cold, disease, insect and other types of environmental or cultural pressures. SP-90 also increases general plant productivity, in terms of yield, as well as plant stem strength. Within the soil, SP-90 stimulates soil microorganisms, promoting Humus formation. Differences from other Humate products: - Low sodium formulation consisting primarily of Potassium Humic Acid Salts. Provides extra potassium for crop nutrition and minimizes sodium in conditions where high salt content already exists. - The presence of soluble Silicon (Si) compounds in SP-90 provides plants with the nutrition for stronger stems, making them more resistant to natural stress situations and insects.\"", "label": 1}

Grilling skewers on a traditional gas grill is a tough task. Traditional grills heat is concentrated in the center of the grill. On one hand, placing skewers on the edge of the grill will only have the top portion of the skewer contact the heat. On the other hand, placing skewers in the center of the grill will risk having the wooden stick burned all together. It is hard to find a perfect way to cook skewers on a traditional grill. <b>An 8 inches width grill solves the problem</b>. Since this grill is 8 inches wide, only a small portion of the wooden skewer is exposed to the heat. Not only itll cook the meat perfectly in between, the skewers will be free from the heat source and can be turned with ease. Contact-less grilling on skewers means food will not get stuck on the grate, further reducing the risk of teared skin such as those on chicken wings. This will produce moist and juicy barbecue every time when done correctly. <br> <br> With air ventilation design on both ends of the grill, air flow can be easily controlled and heat will be evenly distributed throughout the grill.

This thoughtful, versatile, ultra-portable charcoal grill is designed with the revolutionary GrateLifter charcoal management system that allows you to maximize flavor while minimizing the difficulties associated with grilling with charcoal. So whether you are tailgating before the big game, camping under the stars, or entertaining friends and family at home, the Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill will help you serve up delicious barbecue every time. With a 240 square inch porcelain-coated grill grate, this spacious grill has plenty of room to accommodate lots of food at one time while still distributing heat evenly and efficiently. In addition, the handy integrated precision temperature gauge clearly displays internal temperatures and allows you to accurately manage your cooking. Weighing less than 30 pounds, the grill is ultra-portable -- easy to pack up and carry to any social venue where fine grilled food is on the menu. The grill measures 26 x 19 x 18 inches when in grilling mode. The Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill is designed for the serious chef and grillmaster -- one who understands that grilling over charcoal leads to the tastiest barbecue, and that using a quality charcoal grill will make all the difference. Highlighted by its colorful green enamel-coated steel lid and prominent integrated temperature gauge, the Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill promises to deliver exceptional quality that will withstand the elements and survive years of high-temperature grilling. Grilling with charcoal requires time, patience, and considerable interaction with your grill. To maximize food flavor and tenderness, the master chef must pay close attention to the temperature and understand when to make adjustments. It is both a science and an art... with most chefs having their own personal tactics to achieve the perfect flame. Yet no charcoal grills offer the ability to so easily adjust, add and remove coals as the Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill. The innovative GrateLifter mechanism is a novel cooking grate lifting system that gives the chef access to the charcoal bed without ever having to touch the dirty cooking grate. With the lift engaged, the grate raises effortlessly out of the way when you open the lid. This gives the chef easy, safe access to the coals beneath the grate, allowing you to add coals for extended cooking and adjust the location of the coals to help fine-tune direct heating temperatures. This also comes in handy when you want to smoke foods using indirect heating by letting you easily shift coals to the unused portion of the grill. All of this can now be accomplished without removing the cooking grate -- even when the grate is fully loaded and cooking! The new GrateLifter system also makes the process of lighting coals simple and clean. Simply light the coals in the firebox with the grate in place. When the coals are hot, use the Lift feature and spread the coals without removing the cooking grate. And when the coals turn to ash, use the Lift feature to raise the cooking grate and brush the ash into the ash tray. It's simple, easy, safe, and clean. The Cuisinart GrateLifter Portable Charcoal Grill combines the ideal size of a family charcoal grill with the versatility and compact size for the perfect portable grill. Its spacious 240 square inch grilling surface is ideal for cooking for your entire family, with enough space to cook up to 10 burgers, 8 steaks or 8 chicken breasts. The compact footprint also ensures that this grill will not take up too much space on your patio, like those larger, full-sized grills do. Two removable Cuisinart GrateLifter Side Tables (model number CST-152, sold separately) can provide extra shelf space and come in handy when grilling away from home. The grill fits comfortably on most patio tables, or docks on the Cuisinart Folding Grill Stand (model number CFGS-150, sold separately) for compact, upright grilling at full-size height. The Cuisinart All Foods Gas Grill Cover (model number CGC-21, sold separately) protects the grill when the grill is not in use.

It is a highly effective Deicer & Preventer in temperatures up to -40. It will last longer and require fewer applications then other brands found at retail stores. <br> <b>Directions:</b> <br> <b>Liquid Deicer:</b> Spray or pour onto Snow or Ice accumulations at a rate of 1 to 3 gallons per 1000 SF. This fluid works best when applied in narrow bands to minimize dilution from melting. This liquid ice melt will penetrate to the pavement to break the bonds of ice and snow prior to mechanical removal. <br> <b>Aid to Solid Deicers:</b> Liquid ice melt is also used as an aid to solid deicers in heavy ice situations. A solid deicer is first applied to punch holes in the ice, Then this product is applied over the top which will penetrate the holes to the surface breaking the ice to pavement bond so mechanical removal can be easily accomplished. <br> <b>Ice Prevention:</b> Treating surfaces before snow & ice occur will form a high traction film to prevent adhesion of ice and snow, which is then mechanically removed. Apply at a rate of 1/2 to 1 Gallon per 1000 SF. <br> <b>Pre-Wetting Agent:</b> Use as pre-wetter for solid ice melt products. Because this liquid ice melt has a very low freezing point it significantly improves the performance of solids and does not clog spray nozzles. Salt and other granular ice melts need moisture to start working. Many granular ice melters can not begin melting snow and ice in very low temperatures. By pre-wetting with this product, the liquid portion will begin melting snow immediately allowing the granular ice melts to do their job.\"", "label": 0}

These rugs can make any space come alive. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly. Mad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it!

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

When a switch is off, there is practically no current. When the device is on, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set to the needed duty cycle. This solar system controller adopts the most advance digital techniques and operates fully automatically. The PWM battery charging can greatly increase the lifetime of your battery and has various unique functions and quite easy to use features. The Renogy PWM10/20CC-DB features dual battery charging capability making it great for RVs, caravans, and boats.

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for.

The clever multi-chamber system saves you from turning over the compost and features large filling and removal flaps with Snap-On wind protection. This compost bin has adjustable ventilation for air control in summer and winter. The Aero plus 6000 features composting in 3 stages. In the 1st stage, food and garden waste is collected and mixed with only low ventilation (anaerobic). This has proved to prevent from annoying insects like wasps and flies and to bring a greater mass of waste at one time to the 2nd stage by opening the discharge flap. In the 2nd stage it is digested rapidly with generous ventilation, generating heat up to 70 degrees c (158 f), thereby destroying weeds. Here, the waste looses a lot of volume, so the 2nd stage has a capacity of approximately 3x that of the first cabin. When the 2nd stage is filled, it is very comfortably moved to the 3rd stage, at the same time mixed and aerated by the turning the outside handle which turns the shelf. In the 3rd stage, the digested and cooled down compost is maturing in intense contact with earth and the myriads of useful organisms therein. As new waste is separated from mature compost by the 3-stage system and due to the turning bottom, the mature compost is not compressed - removal is clean & easy through the two large discharge flaps/doors on opposite sides at the bottom camber of the composter.

Grilling skewers on a traditional gas grill is a tough task. Traditional grills heat is concentrated in the center of the grill. On one hand, placing skewers on the edge of the grill will only have the top portion of the skewer contact the heat. On the other hand, placing skewers in the center of the grill will risk having the wooden stick burned all together. It is hard to find a perfect way to cook skewers on a traditional grill. <b>An 8 inches width grill solves the problem</b>. Since this grill is 8 inches wide, only a small portion of the wooden skewer is exposed to the heat. Not only itll cook the meat perfectly in between, the skewers will be free from the heat source and can be turned with ease. Contact-less grilling on skewers means food will not get stuck on the grate, further reducing the risk of teared skin such as those on chicken wings. This will produce moist and juicy barbecue every time when done correctly. <br> <br> With air ventilation design on both ends of the grill, air flow can be easily controlled and heat will be evenly distributed throughout the grill. Furthermore, the grill has a charcoal-holding grid at the bottom so your hot charcoal stays up and is not extinguished by the ashes it generates. <br><br> Needless to say, this grill can be easily cleaned with a garden hose.

You can do this yearround inside or outside, and harvest compost up to once a month! Your first tray will take about three months to become fully composted by the worms. After the first tray is composted the other trays can take as little as a month depending on the waste added. Once you harvest your finished compost from the bottom tray, you will have an empty tray to stack on top again. The nutrientrich finished compost can be used in your garden, raised beds, container gardens, or on houseplants.

HOW TO USE: Plug in torch cord to a grounded electrical outlet (120V~, 1500W, 60Hz). Point nozzle directly at single piece of charcoal, no farther than 3 inches away. Flip switch to '1' to ignite the charcoal. Once charcoal is lit, flip switch to '2' to blow hot air onto the surrounding coals. If you are lighting a large amount of charcoal, consider igniting more than one charcoal to make sure the fire spreads evenly across your coals. After removing wand from the charcoal, unplug the wand and place it on its kickstand to cool. Let Starter Wand cool completely on a heat-safe surface before storing. CARE: Store indoors when not in use.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Lumber Jack 100-Percent Hickory Wood BBQ Grilling Pellets, 20-Pound Bag\" COL feature VAL \"Made from actual trees, not just residual wood. Made using the bark and cambium layer of trees. This is the area where the most flavor in a tree resides. Made in a smaller diameter to create a hotter burn and more smoke with more surface area. Available in a multitude of flavors including pure and blended mixtures Made in the USA\" COL description VAL \"We are an actual manufacturing plant that uses real trees and processes them into our products. We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

Just remember that they are biennial and take two years to bloom. These wonderful old-fashioned flowers make an excellent backdrop for shorter flowers and blend into any garden with great charm and ease!!! Description: Hollyhocks are almost as easy to grow as sunflowers and would probably be grown as often if more gardeners were aware of their good nature. Unlike many other dramatic flowers that are simpler to admire than to actually grow, hollyhocks need no coddling. Sowing: Late spring to early autumn Although classed as a biennial, Hollyhock often lives for several years. They must establish a root system first, and then they can produce the stalk(s) of flowers, for their first year they will bear leaves only. If sown early in the year they may bloom the same year, but sown midyear they will bloom the following summer. Hollyhocks are generally planted in midsummer to autumn to give them a chance to establish a system during the winter months. Seeds can be sown directly into a prepared bed or can be started in pots in a cold frame or indoors, to be planted as transplants during spring. Hollyhocks also adapt beautifully to containers, as long as the containers are deep enough. Sow seeds at 20C (68F) on the surface of a peaty soil. Lay the seed on the surface of well-tilled soil, cover with about 2mm (in) layer of soil. Keep moist and do not let the seeds dry out once planted. They will usually germinate in 2 to 3 weeks at 20C (68F). If planted indoors, prick out each seedling as it becomes large enough to handle, transplant into 7.5cm (3in) pots or trays. Gradually acclimatise to outdoor conditions for 10 to 15 days before planting out after all risk of frost. The seeds are packed in paper envelopes. Germinating power is tested, best before 12.2017.\"", "label": 1}

They were among the first culinary experts to hail the food processor as a revolutionary kitchen appliance when it was introduced to America in 1973 by the late Cuisinart founder, Carl Sontheimer. They saw the food processor as a quick and easy way to make fine food and healthy dishes. Today that legacy is alive and well&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Cuisinart is a universally recognized name, endorsed by culinary connoisseurs such as Jacques P&eacute;pin and Hubert Keller, and remaining actively engaged in culinary education, including sponsoring such projects as Four-Star Chef Eric Ripert's popular public television cooking series Avec Eric. In addition, Cuisinart has a long-standing history of receiving prestigious design awards for a wide range of items.

Seed companies in the United States have also taken to labeling this plant as \"Thai Red Roselle.\" In grocery stores Hibiscus sabdariffa is erroneously marketed as \"Hibiscus flowers\"; while the pink flowers are gorgeous in their own right, it's actually the fleshy red calyces that are dried for tea and used as food. Homegrown calyces are far superior to anything that can be found in the marketplace. They make a great addition to lemonade or a bioregional substitute for cranberries. This plant has an otherworldly appearance and is a real joy to grow. However, climate is definitely a consideration. It is considered a subtropical/tropical plant, so it needs heat to bear usable herbage. Most gardeners in the continental United States can have some success growing the plant as an annual, although it can perennialize in warmer areas. Timing is especially vital for cooler climates. Richo Cech at Horizon Herbs grows the plant up in Southern Oregon (zone 6) and recommends starting seedlings early in a greenhouse and transplanting immediately after last frost. Here in Ojai (Zone 8B), we start seedlings in April, transplanted them by May, and got a seed and herb crop in mid-November. Seeds must be scarified (we gently brush them with a 150-grit sandpaper) prior to planting. We've found that amending the soil with copious amounts of potassium (most especially in soils where it is lacking) increases the vigor of the plants tremendously. The Julia Morton monograph referenced above has some anecdotal fertility guidance, suggesting applications of a 4-6-7 NPK.\"", "label": 1}

Create succulent, juicy and finger-licking good barbecue with this 32 long shaped charcoal grill. This grill is specially designed so that skewers can sit on both sides of the grill, allowing meat in the middle to be cooked right in the center of the heat. <br><br> Gone are the days that the meats are only half cooked when the wooden sticks are starting to burn! Grilling skewers on a traditional gas grill is a tough task. Traditional grills heat is concentrated in the center of the grill. On one hand, placing skewers on the edge of the grill will only have the top portion of the skewer contact the heat. On the other hand, placing skewers in the center of the grill will risk having the wooden stick burned all together. It is hard to find a perfect way to cook skewers on a traditional grill. <b>An 8 inches width grill solves the problem</b>. Since this grill is 8 inches wide, only a small portion of the wooden skewer is exposed to the heat. Not only itll cook the meat perfectly in between, the skewers will be free from the heat source and can be turned with ease. Contact-less grilling on skewers means food will not get stuck on the grate, further reducing the risk of teared skin such as those on chicken wings. This will produce moist and juicy barbecue every time when done correctly. <br> <br> With air ventilation design on both ends of the grill, air flow can be easily controlled and heat will be evenly distributed throughout the grill. Furthermore, the grill has a charcoal-holding grid at the bottom so your hot charcoal stays up and is not extinguished by the ashes it generates. <br><br> Needless to say, this grill can be easily cleaned with a garden hose. Fold-able legs design saves space so that the grill can be conveniently stored in the trunk. <br><br> Get this grill today and become the grill master of your own backyard, pool side, tailgating party, park picnic, camping, day at the beach and a lot more!\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Lion Premium Grills 90823 40&quot; Natural Gas Grill\" COL feature VAL \"5 cast stainless steel burners (90,000 total BTUs) XL commercial temperature gauge 1030 square inches of cooking surface Size: 40\" Infrared rotisserie back burner\" COL description VAL \"Features include the following.

MELTS & PREVENTS Ice, Frost & Snow NON TOXIC Safe for Pets WILL NOT harm vegetation or lawns NON STAINING Formula leaves no residue on floors\" COL description VAL \"This Concentrated Liquid Calcium Chloride is used for customers that need a fast acting product in extreme temperatures. It is a highly effective Deicer & Preventer in temperatures up to -40. It will last longer and require fewer applications then other brands found at retail stores. <br> <b>Directions:</b> <br> <b>Liquid Deicer:</b> Spray or pour onto Snow or Ice accumulations at a rate of 1 to 3 gallons per 1000 SF. This fluid works best when applied in narrow bands to minimize dilution from melting. This liquid ice melt will penetrate to the pavement to break the bonds of ice and snow prior to mechanical removal. <br> <b>Aid to Solid Deicers:</b> Liquid ice melt is also used as an aid to solid deicers in heavy ice situations. A solid deicer is first applied to punch holes in the ice, Then this product is applied over the top which will penetrate the holes to the surface breaking the ice to pavement bond so mechanical removal can be easily accomplished. <br> <b>Ice Prevention:</b> Treating surfaces before snow & ice occur will form a high traction film to prevent adhesion of ice and snow, which is then mechanically removed. Apply at a rate of 1/2 to 1 Gallon per 1000 SF. <br> <b>Pre-Wetting Agent:</b> Use as pre-wetter for solid ice melt products. Because this liquid ice melt has a very low freezing point it significantly improves the performance of solids and does not clog spray nozzles. Salt and other granular ice melts need moisture to start working. Many granular ice melters can not begin melting snow and ice in very low temperatures. By pre-wetting with this product, the liquid portion will begin melting snow immediately allowing the granular ice melts to do their job.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Plastic Roof Ice Guard Mini Snow Guard (500 Pack) Prevent Sliding Snow Ice Buildup\" COL feature VAL \"Stop snow from sliding off your roof.

Year Round Production Odor Free Operation Expandable up to 7 trays\" COL description VAL \"Worm composting is an incredibly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for your garden. Master gardeners agree that compost produced by worms will produce the best results and help your plants thrive. The Worm Factory's unique stackable, multi-tray design makes it the most efficient worm bin composter around. Worms begin eating waste in the lowest tray, and then migrate upward as food sources in that tray are exhausted. By allowing worms to migrate upward, the worms separate themselves from the finished compost that is ready for the garden. Besides the worm castings that are produced through this process, the Worm Factory also produces a second type of compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through your Worm Factory, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer, know as leachate is gathered in the special collection tray of the Worm Factory and can easily be drained from the spigot. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrient rich compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system taking nutrient-rich particles with it. You can drain organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. It's compact square design gives the Worm Factory the smallest footprint of all worm composters. The Worm Factory's tray stacking system allows it to hold the largest capacity of compost in the smallest amount of space, making it the perfect composter for anyone with space limitations. The Worm Factory is simple to operate. When full, each tray weighs only 12.5 pounds making lifting and arranging trays effortless. The included 38-page instruction manual and instructional DVD makes setup fast and easy and gives tips on how to best manage your Worm Factory composter year-round.\"", "label": 0}

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

This item is ideal for organic household waste and kitchen scraps (not for grass cuttings in large quantity.) The clever multi-chamber system saves you from turning over the compost and features large filling and removal flaps with Snap-On wind protection. This compost bin has adjustable ventilation for air control in summer and winter. The Aero plus 6000 features composting in 3 stages. In the 1st stage, food and garden waste is collected and mixed with only low ventilation (anaerobic). This has proved to prevent from annoying insects like wasps and flies and to bring a greater mass of waste at one time to the 2nd stage by opening the discharge flap. In the 2nd stage it is digested rapidly with generous ventilation, generating heat up to 70 degrees c (158 f), thereby destroying weeds. Here, the waste looses a lot of volume, so the 2nd stage has a capacity of approximately 3x that of the first cabin. When the 2nd stage is filled, it is very comfortably moved to the 3rd stage, at the same time mixed and aerated by the turning the outside handle which turns the shelf. In the 3rd stage, the digested and cooled down compost is maturing in intense contact with earth and the myriads of useful organisms therein. As new waste is separated from mature compost by the 3-stage system and due to the turning bottom, the mature compost is not compressed - removal is clean & easy through the two large discharge flaps/doors on opposite sides at the bottom camber of the composter. The Aero plus 6000 is the winner of the red dot design award and best of the best in 2013. 2 year warranty. Measures 31.1 X 31.1 X 43.3 Inches. Made by Juwel in Austria.\"", "label": 0}

Year Round Production Odor Free Operation Expandable up to 7 trays\" COL description VAL \"Worm composting is an incredibly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for your garden. Master gardeners agree that compost produced by worms will produce the best results and help your plants thrive. The Worm Factory's unique stackable, multi-tray design makes it the most efficient worm bin composter around. Worms begin eating waste in the lowest tray, and then migrate upward as food sources in that tray are exhausted. By allowing worms to migrate upward, the worms separate themselves from the finished compost that is ready for the garden. Besides the worm castings that are produced through this process, the Worm Factory also produces a second type of compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through your Worm Factory, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer, know as leachate is gathered in the special collection tray of the Worm Factory and can easily be drained from the spigot. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrient rich compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system taking nutrient-rich particles with it. You can drain organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. It's compact square design gives the Worm Factory the smallest footprint of all worm composters. The Worm Factory's tray stacking system allows it to hold the largest capacity of compost in the smallest amount of space, making it the perfect composter for anyone with space limitations. The Worm Factory is simple to operate. When full, each tray weighs only 12.5 pounds making lifting and arranging trays effortless. The included 38-page instruction manual and instructional DVD makes setup fast and easy and gives tips on how to best manage your Worm Factory composter year-round.\"", "label": 0}

What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell? <i>IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS</i> Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet. This means that each individual pellet is a blend. Most competitors merely blend different flavored pellets together in the bag.

This flower doormat brings the lavender style to your doorway, complementing your home's atmosphere. Each piece of floral door mat decor is not only tasteful in appearance, but is also a very functional doormat. When it comes to these doormats, outdoor decor is their specialty. Capable of trapping moisture from the outside, wet environments should get to put up a fight against these doormats. Trapping moisture is good for a number of beneficial reasons. For one, moisture is held back from getting inside and on your floor's surface via incoming foot traffic. A wet surface can cause slips and falls, making it unsafe. When moisture is left uncontrolled, it can also spread throughout your floor, leaving it messy and undesirable to look at. Not only is each flower doormat great for providing a moisture trapping door mat, but it is also great for its eco-friendly design. Each floral door mat is surfaced with coir, a natural material. Coir is a \"green\" fibrous material, making this coir door mat great for those with the environment on their minds. Environmentally friendly products are also great for their low production costs. Using a natural ingredient like coir makes each flower doormat more affordable than products made with only non-natural ingredients. Not only eco-friendly, each doormat provides a bit of a barrier for your entryway's sensitive surface. Both PVC and coir come together to provide some slight cushioning against incoming contact such as foot traffic. Having a barrier like this coir door mat makes these products a nice addition for adding a little extra protection for your flooring.\"", "label": 1}

Create succulent, juicy and finger-licking good barbecue with this 32 long shaped charcoal grill. This grill is specially designed so that skewers can sit on both sides of the grill, allowing meat in the middle to be cooked right in the center of the heat. <br><br> Gone are the days that the meats are only half cooked when the wooden sticks are starting to burn! Grilling skewers on a traditional gas grill is a tough task. Traditional grills heat is concentrated in the center of the grill. On one hand, placing skewers on the edge of the grill will only have the top portion of the skewer contact the heat. On the other hand, placing skewers in the center of the grill will risk having the wooden stick burned all together. It is hard to find a perfect way to cook skewers on a traditional grill. <b>An 8 inches width grill solves the problem</b>. Since this grill is 8 inches wide, only a small portion of the wooden skewer is exposed to the heat. Not only itll cook the meat perfectly in between, the skewers will be free from the heat source and can be turned with ease. Contact-less grilling on skewers means food will not get stuck on the grate, further reducing the risk of teared skin such as those on chicken wings. This will produce moist and juicy barbecue every time when done correctly. <br> <br> With air ventilation design on both ends of the grill, air flow can be easily controlled and heat will be evenly distributed throughout the grill. Furthermore, the grill has a charcoal-holding grid at the bottom so your hot charcoal stays up and is not extinguished by the ashes it generates. <br><br> Needless to say, this grill can be easily cleaned with a garden hose.
