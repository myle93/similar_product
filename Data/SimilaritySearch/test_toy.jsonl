To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"Road Name: Pennsylvania (single stripe) Product Information This DCC sound-equipped model includes our Sound Value SoundTraxx(c) diesel sound package with prototypical 567 prime mover, 3 air horns, and bell - all in polyphonic 16-bit sound.

Today farmers raise Holsteins for their amazing milk-producing ability: the average cow produces 3,250 gallons of milk a year. They live three to four years, but some have been known to live much longer. Cattle have four stomachs. They graze on a combination of grasses and hay; once the food passes through their first stomach, it's called cud.

This colorful and impressively statured figure offers two transformation modes, allowing kids to play with the toy as a samurai robot or rampaging bull. Or, they can combine it with other Zord vehicles and figures to create the Ultrazord (each sold separately). With its extending legs, rotating shoulder blasters, oversize Gatling cannon, and six wheels, the Bull Megazord offers mighty morphin' fun for ages four and up. The Bull Megazord comes as a sleek samurai robot warrior, but can quickly be transformed into the impressive Bull Megazord. In its robot form, the figure stands over 1 foot tall and is enhanced by moveable arms, rotating shoulder-mounted blasters, and an attachable Gatling cannon accessory that can be held in either hand or stored on its waist. When it's time for the samurai robot to charge into battle, the figure transforms into the ferocious Bull Megazord complete with golden bull horns. In just a few easy steps, kids can rotate the arms, extend the legs and head, and flip the figure over to allow it to roll on its six wheels for a piercing attack. For enhanced fun, the Bull Megazord can be combined with select Power Rangers Zord vehicles and figures to create the ultimate weapon--the Ultrazord (each sold separately). Choose from a variety of items in the ZordBuilder Collection and snap them to the Bull Megazord's body to create your own unique hero. For guidance, a step-by-step instruction sheet is included demonstrating a variety of figure combinations. This figure is not as sophisticated as some other transforming robots on the market, and its articulation is limited--only its arms rotate. However, the transformation process is easy to accomplish as kids need only rotate the arms into position, pull the legs out, and extend the figure's head forward to change the basic configuration. Because of its ease of use and imaginative design, the Bull Megazord makes for a versatile toy to play with and relive your favorite Power Rangers moments. Appealing to a global audience since 1993, Power Rangers has become an international phenomenon. Airing in more than 40 markets worldwide and offering more than 700 episodes to date, the show emphasizes the importance of teamwork, personal responsibility, physical fitness, and helping those in need.

They can become the engineers of their own imaginations with so much to do. Starting at the Easy-Rail Station, the special track area makes it so easy for them to get their RC train lined up on the tracks. Board the engineer figure into the front of the classic steam engine or on the back of the red caboose. Little boys can control the train two ways - push it along or control the action from afar with an easy-to-use RC controller. The controller features forward and reverse controls and train sound effects. Drive the train around the curve, up the hill and to the mountain. Pick up logs to keep the \"wood-burning\" engine going. Use the crane on top of the mountain to load it all up. The train can make its way down the winding hill and back to the Easy-Rail Station to drop off cargo and complete the trip. Set up the 15 pieces of durable, Snap-Lock track in so many ways for new adventures. It's the perfect 1st train set for the 2-year old engineer. And since GeoTrax is a system that all works together - add onto this set for even more fun. With the Fisher-Price GeoTrax Remote Control Timber Railway, kids get to be conductors of their very own train. Completely remote-controlled, the three-car train features auto-aligning wheels that ensure the train stays on the tracks. Children will enjoy piloting the train around the railroad's many colorful bends, loops and slopes. They can use the working crane to load logs onto the train, or make a quick stop at the Easy Rail Station.

Fun and Easy to Play With</b><br> The Timber Railway is painted in vibrant colors and has a cute, cartoonish look that kids will undoubtedly enjoy. The included train (named \"Steamer\") comes with three cars: a steam engine, a log cart, and a caboose. When the train's wheels move, its smokestack moves up and down. The train also comes with a conductor action figure. Both Steamer and the conductor also appear in the included feature DVD, which gives kids a story to work within and deepens their imaginative options.<P> The railroad adventure begins at the Easy Rail Station by placing the train on the orange portion of the railway where it automatically aligns to the track. In general, the auto-aligning mechanism does well keeping the train on the tracks, but the train will occasionally derail when going down some of the steeper slopes. Kids can pilot the train by using an intuitive remote control, or can opt to move it around by hand. As the train traverses the track, it will make its way up a mountain, circle around loops and drive through a tunnel. There's also a working crane, where kids can load lumber and other cargo onto the cars. <P> <b>Build a Railroading Network</b><br> The Timbertown Railway features interlocking track pieces that snap together easily. Although it has been built for easy assembly, the track will most likely require some adult assistance during setup. With the help of the included instructions, setup should take approximately 15 minutes. In all, the set requires six \"AAA\" batteries (not included) -- three for the steam engine and three for the remote control.<P> The Timber Railway has been designed with smaller children in mind, and older kids will quickly get bored with the railway's compact size and limited activities. However, it is an ideal starter railroad set for younger children, and will provide hours of imaginative play. The set is also compatible with the rest of the GeoTrax set -- buy them all to assemble the ultimate railroad play set.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> Easy Rail Station, elevated mountain with tunnel and working crane, remote control, steam engine, log cart, caboose, conductor action figure, lumber cargo, 15 pieces of track, and instructions.<P> <br> <table cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\"><tr> <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-2-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=720,height=550'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-2-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><font size=\"1\"><b><em>Piloting the train is a breeze with the remote control. <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-2-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=720,height=550'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</em></b></font> </td> <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-3-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=720,height=550'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-3-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><font size=\"1\"><b><em>Use the working crane to load logs onto the train. <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-3-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=720,height=550'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</em></b></font> </td> <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-4-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=720,height=550'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-4-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><font size=\"1\"><b><em>Make a quick stop at the Easy Rail Station. <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/B001W1YG56-4-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=720,height=550'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</em></b></font> </td> </tr></table> <br clear=\"all\">\"", "label": 0}

Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"Bachmann Silver Series rolling stock features blackened metal wheels, body mounted couplers, non-magnetic axles.

The Spitfire was built in many variants, using several wing configurations, and was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft. It was also the only British fighter to be in continuous production throughout the war. The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts; about 54 remain airworthy, while many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world. The Spitfire was designed as a short-range, high-performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell, chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works, which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong from 1928. Mitchell pushed the Spitfire's distinctive elliptical wing (designed by B. Shenstone) to have the thinnest possible cross-section, helping give the aircraft a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters, including the Hawker Hurricane. Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937, whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer, overseeing the development of the Spitfire through its multitude of variants.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"New Ray, WW II, 1:48 scale, Mitsubishi A6M Zero, plastic model\" COL feature VAL \"model of WW II plane Zero fighter assembly required, easy kit model length: 185mm./7.4\" model wingspan: 250mm./10\" stand included age 8+\" COL description VAL \"The Mitsubishi A6M \"Zero\" is a long-range fighter aircraft, manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1940 to 1945. The A6M was designated as the Mitsubishi Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter, or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen. The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the \"Reisen\" (zero fighter), \"0\" being the last digit of the Imperial year 2600 (1940) when it entered service with the Imperial Navy. The official Allied reporting name was \"Zeke\", although the use of the name \"Zero\" was later commonly adopted by the Allies as well. When it was introduced early in World War II, the Zero was considered the most capable carrier-based fighter in the world, combining excellent maneuverability and very long range. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (\"IJNAS\") also frequently used the type as a land-based fighter. In early combat operations, the Zero gained a legendary reputation as a dogfighter, achieving the outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1, but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled the Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms. By 1943, inherent design weaknesses and the failure to develop more powerful aircraft engines meant that the Zero became less effective against newer Allied fighters, which possessed greater firepower, armor, and speed, and approached the Zero's maneuverability. Although the Mitsubishi A6M was outdated by 1944, design delays and production difficulties of newer Japanese aircraft types meant that it continued to serve in a front line role until the end of the war. During the final year of the War in the Pacific, the Zero was also adapted for use in kamikaze operations. During the course of the war, Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft.\"", "label": 1}

Exclusive Tales of T Samuel Origins\" COL description VAL \"Chewing Gum - Once, all chewing gum was made from chicle. That's the sap of the Sapodilla tree, which grows in rain forests in Central America. Men called chicleros climbed up the tall trees and, with their machetes, cut criss-crosses in the trunks so that the sticky sap flowed out. Then the chicle was processed and turned into gum. Today, mose chewing gum is made from synthetic stuff, but the gum base inside this kit includes real chicle. So now, chicleros have a reason to harvest the chicle and protect their trees! Don't just chew, chew chicle! Gummy - We're all used to eating foods from pants that grow in the Earth - Carrots, corn, raspberries, etc...But how about food from plants that grow in the sea? You might think seaweed as that slimy green stuff you find on the beach. But, it's more than that: people in Japan and China have been eating \"sea vegetables\" for hundreds of years. Even though we're not used to collecting and eating whole seaweed here, it's there hiding in many things we eat and use ever day. like toothpaste! With this Gummy Kit, you get a chance to see seaweed work its invisible magic yourself! Chocolate - Chocolate comes from cacao beans which were originally found in Central and South America. Aztec legend tells of their god, Quetzalcoatl, who brought the cacao tree from paradise to Earth. Now that you possess the ancient Aztec secret to making chocolate, you can enjoy the taste that was once reserved for only the Aztec elite!

Non-Championship races were often used to test developments on Grand Prix cars and in these early months of 1969 the negatives were yet to outweigh the positive aspects of high mounted aero-wings as the Lotus 49B cars would discover at the Spanish Grand Prix. Bruce McLaren, fellow Antipodean and friend of Brabham, was also running a high wing on his McLaren M7C No.6 car at the Spanish Grand Prix of 1969. During the race boh Lotus 49B cars driven by Graham Hill and Jochen Rindt crashed heavily after the high wings failed. The potential for these wings to fail with a high risk of injury to drivers and spectators was of grave concern and after just a few brief months of an exciting innovative development, such wings were banned by the FIA authorities.

They are so enticing! Colorful, smooth, squishy, cool Really, theres not much more you need to do with water beads than have a bowl full of them to plunge your hands into and hold and squish them. Water beads seem like magic to kids because the beads start out so tiny and grow within a few hours. Just watching the beads change is a fun activity for younger kids.Use them in vases, bowls, and jars for eye appeal. They are great for centerpieces for weddings and other events. The water beads really add a wow factor that can turn ordinary vases and bowls into something beautiful. 3. Water Beads for Plants Water beads are also great to use with plants. They help plants retain water and reduce the amount of watering plants need. They release the water gradually so the plant isn't flooded with water. The water beads can also act as a replacement for soil with some plants. Bamboo plants do well with water beads rather than soil. 1 tsp dry beads will yield about 1 quart of Water beads when fully hydrated. 2. Allow the beads to fully expand in 6-8 hours. 3. Remove the expanded beads from the water and pour into vases or bowls and ready to use.\"", "label": 0}

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"EMD SD 40-2 Diesel Locomotive - DCC Ready - WHEELING & LAKE ERIE #6352 - HO Scale. All-wheel drive.

They are so enticing! Colorful, smooth, squishy, cool Really, theres not much more you need to do with water beads than have a bowl full of them to plunge your hands into and hold and squish them. Water beads seem like magic to kids because the beads start out so tiny and grow within a few hours. Just watching the beads change is a fun activity for younger kids.Use them in vases, bowls, and jars for eye appeal. They are great for centerpieces for weddings and other events. The water beads really add a wow factor that can turn ordinary vases and bowls into something beautiful. 3. Water Beads for Plants Water beads are also great to use with plants. They help plants retain water and reduce the amount of watering plants need. They release the water gradually so the plant isn't flooded with water. The water beads can also act as a replacement for soil with some plants. Bamboo plants do well with water beads rather than soil. 1 tsp dry beads will yield about 1 quart of Water beads when fully hydrated. 2. Allow the beads to fully expand in 6-8 hours. 3.

Continue your experiments by constructing increasingly complex models: a solar-bot, a moon rover, and a stag beetle. Finally, build a cool praying mantis model that moves like an insect and is powered by a solar cell. The models can also be powered by a battery, allowing operation in all lighting conditions.

The engine itself was a 90 3 liters liquid-cooled V8, with two turbochargers, working at a maximum pressure of 3 bars; four valves per cylinder were driven by double over head camshaft.

Chassis was made of aluminum and magnesium while body was carbon fiber composite. The overall weight was 850 kg. Lancia LC2s were as quick as Porsches, in terms of pure speed, but lacked reliability. Lancia raced LC2 cars ex-works throughout 1986; later, and until 1991, it was raced by privateers only. In 1986, LC2 cars sponsored by Martini competed the World Sports car Championship with race numbers 4 and 5.
