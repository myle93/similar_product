But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><font color=CC6600>In-Ground Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><font color=CC6600>Wall-Mount Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><font color=CC6600>Portable Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><font color=CC6600>Backboard Considerations</font></strong><br> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"HDE 5W Mini Bull Horn Megaphone Voice Amplifier with Lanyard\" COL feature VAL \"Super loud and clear sound Compact size, handy and convenient Music button: Push to play built-in music Color: Green & White; Size: 3.85 x 6.3 / 9.8 x 16cm Batteries: 6 x AA (Not Included)\" COL description VAL \"This MegaPhone is just what youre looking for.

PowerBlocks work intuitively. Rather than requiring you to buy a room full of dumbbells, PowerBlocks act just like a weight stack at the gym, with a weight handle that fits inside the first weight, which fits inside the second, which fits inside the third, etc. When you want to change weights, you simply move the weight selector pin into the appropriate slot and you're set. As you lift the core, all the weights above the selector pin are lifted at the same time, turning your 3-pound dumbbell into a 6-pound dumbbell, or your 6-pound dumbbell into a 12-pound dumbbell. Not only is the system remarkably easy to use, but it's also cost- and space-efficient, as a single pair of dumbbells can do the work of dozens. This personal trainer set is a hybrid system that employs the weight stack from PowerBlock's Personal Set and the handles of the Elite Set. As a result, users can achieve every 2.5-pound jump within the weight range of 5 to 50 pounds per dumbbell, in effect doing the job of 40 individual weights. Even better, the weights are more compact and balanced than traditional dumbbells, with a padded handle that protects people with weak wrists.

Each figure in the Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl 3-Pack is depicted in their white jersey with the Super Bowl patch as worn during the championship game. Quarterback Joe Flacco completed one of the greatest playoff performances of all time, throwing for 287 yards and three touchdowns while earning his first Super Bowl MVP. Ray Lewis was the inspirational leader of the Ravens, on and off the field. Having spent his entire career with the team and bringing the city two titles, the Super Bowl victory was the icing on his career cake. Lewis kept his team calm and together, allowing them to pull out the victory in the closing moments. Jacoby Jones definitely decided to save his best performances for when it mattered most. Though he had a respectable season as the Ravens third WR, it was in the playoffs where he truly shined. Jones caught the game tying TD against the Broncos to keep the Ravens season alive and added two more TD's in Super Bowl XLVII against the 49ers to seal their win.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "label": 0}

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><font color=CC6600>In-Ground Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><font color=CC6600>Wall-Mount Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><font color=CC6600>Portable Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><font color=CC6600>Backboard Considerations</font></strong><br> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "label": 0}

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "label": 0}

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">In-Ground Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Wall-Mount Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Portable Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Backboard Considerations</span></strong><br /> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "label": 0}

Turned and Dried Seven Times Each blank is turned seven times while the wood is curing to prevent warping. We also treat the wood with Nelsonite, a patented stabilizer that protects it from atmospheric changes. We then apply a proprietary epoxy finish that seals the pores in the wood, protecting the cue even further from moisture and warping. Exotic Hardwood Butts Exotic and hard woods used in Players Cues include: Cocobola, Walnut, Purple Heart, American Birds-eye and Straight Grain Maple. High-Gloss Super UV Finish + French Cue Wax and a Pro Taper The high-gloss super finish on a Players cue provides an armor coating that protects from fading and chipping. We give each Players shaft a professional taper and treat it with a special French cue wax, allowing it to literally glide through your fingers for a much better, smoother stroke. Quality French Le Pro Tips All Players cues (excluding the HXT Technology Series) come standard with a high-quality French Le Pro tip for maximum ball control. Special High-Impact Ferrule The high-impact ferrule on a Players cue is so durable that it carries a lifetime guarantee against chipping or cracking. Players Lifetime Guarantee All Players Cues now come with a Lifetime Warranty against manufacturer defects on non-wearable parts, including WARPING.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"American Legend Enforcer 7&rsquo; Hockey Table\" COL feature VAL \"Two Blower Motors for Fast Play Abacus-Style Scoring Arched Legs with Levelers Aluminum Rails for Fast Rebound Includes: 4 Red Pucks and 4 Red Strikers\" COL description VAL \"<div class=\"aplus\">  Abacus-style scoring<br>  Aluminum rails for excellent rebound<br>  Arched legs with leg levelers<br>  Play surface dimensions: 771/4\" x 351/2\"<br>  Cloth Extreme Hockey blind<br>  Two blower motors<br>  7\" Apron<br>  Includes: red pucks (4) and strikers (4)<br>  Assembled dimensions: 42 W x 84 D x 32 H<br> </div>\"", "label": 0}

The three companies, collectively combined, are now the largest basketball equipment supplier in the world. Spalding is the official basketball supplier of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the official backboard of the NBA and NCAA, the official volleyball of the King of the Beach Volleyball Tour and the official football of the Arena Football League (AFL) and Pop Warner. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\"><big>Amazon.com Basketball System Buying Guide</big></span></strong><br /> With the high-quality construction of many portable basketball systems, turning your driveway into a basketball court can be as simple as hooking up your garden hose. But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">In-Ground Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Wall-Mount Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Portable Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Backboard Considerations</span></strong><br /> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"HDE 5W Mini Bull Horn Megaphone Voice Amplifier with Lanyard\" COL feature VAL \"Super loud and clear sound Compact size, handy and convenient Music button: Push to play built-in music Color: Green & White; Size: 3.85 x 6.3 / 9.8 x 16cm Batteries: 6 x AA (Not Included)\" COL description VAL \"This MegaPhone is just what youre looking for.

The Stainless King series creates a new chapter in Thermos' storied history with a modern line that blends out newest technology with a dash of the past. An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer.This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot for 12 and cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce beverage bottle is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. Top of the line construction and rubber gaskets keep this bottle leak-proof and because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is made of BPA-free materials.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Winning Streak NCAA Indiana Hoosiers Dynasty Banner\" COL feature VAL \"These vinatge style wool banners commemorate the great teams and schools that have achieved the ultimate level of glory by being crowned a champion.

Not anymore. Sniper Rapid Transition Sights provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. Designed by Sniper and a top 3-Gun shooter these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45 Degree. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight.

The Stainless King series creates a new chapter in Thermos' storied history with a modern line that blends out newest technology with a dash of the past. An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer.This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot for 12 and cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce beverage bottle is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. Top of the line construction and rubber gaskets keep this bottle leak-proof and because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is made of BPA-free materials.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Colorado Buffaloes Banner with Hanging Pole\" COL feature VAL \"Large Banner is 30\" x 40\" and is made of 1-Ply Polyester with 2-Ply \"School Name\" Bottom Panel Includes a 36\" wide 3/4\" thick Hardwood Banner Pole with heavy white Hanging Rope Screen Printed Logos are Viewable on Both Sides (Team Logo is Reversed on Opposite Side, School Name bottom panel is 2-Ply Double-Sided) Removable Banner Pole can fit sleeved flags up to 30\".

The Stainless King series creates a new chapter in Thermos' storied history with a modern line that blends out newest technology with a dash of the past. An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer.This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot for 12 and cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce beverage bottle is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. Top of the line construction and rubber gaskets keep this bottle leak-proof and because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is made of BPA-free materials.\"", "label": 0}

The Stainless King series creates a new chapter in Thermos' storied history with a modern line that blends out newest technology with a dash of the past. An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer.This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot for 12 and cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce beverage bottle is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. Top of the line construction and rubber gaskets keep this bottle leak-proof and because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is made of BPA-free materials.\"", "label": 0}

Not only has every point scored in the NFL been with a Wilson Football, but every Wilson NFL game ball has been handcrafted in Ada, OH by skilled craftsmen and women for decades. \"The Duke\" NFL football was named in honor of the game's pioneering legend and NY Giants owner, Wellington Mara. Back when Mara was a young boy taking in the game from the sidelines, the Giants players dubbed him \"The Duke\" and years later, the NFL game ball took on this nickname too. Bring home \"The Duke\" today, which is as close as a fan can get to the authentic, on-field icon that's been passed, caught and carried by the game's greatest since the NFL started in 1941. Grab onto a piece of history with Wilson's official NFL game ball--The Duke--which is dedicated to football legend Wellington \"Duke\" Mara. More than just a piece of memorabilia, The Duke is designed with the serious competitor in mind, with genuine hand-sewn, Tanned in Tack leather for superior playability and grip, and 3-ply VPU bladder for maximum durability and air retention. Other features include double lacing, the official NFL seal in gold, and Commissioner Roger Goodell signature stamp. <table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/B000FA9U1A-balldetail.jpg\" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The return of The Duke.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> Wellington \"The Duke\" Mara passed away in October, 2005 at the age of 89 after dedicating 81 years to the New York Giants as an administrator, owner, and unwavering booster. In 1940, heeding the advice of influential team owners Tim Mara of the New York Giants and George Halas of the Chicago Bears, the NFL selected Wilson as the league's official football supplier. The following year, Wilson introduced a redesigned football and named it \"The Duke\" in honor of Mara's son, Wellington. The Duke stayed in play for nearly three decades until the NFL and AFL merged in 1969. <b>About Wilson</b><br> At the heart of sports history for almost a century, Wilson has been influential and intimately involved in shaping the games of tennis, golf, baseball, and American football.

There, he and the cutlers union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldiers Knife and in 1897 with the Officers Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as inoxydable\"\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.<br> <br> Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. <br> <br> <b>Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives</b><br> The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.<br> <br> <b>Sharpening</b><br> To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15 20. This will result in a cutting angle of 30 40. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.<br> <br> <b>Cleaning</b><br> After youve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher. From the renowned company that created the Swiss Army Knife a century ago comes the Swiss Army golf tool, a compact device designed specifically for the avid golfer. The golf tool comes with all the tools you need for a day on the course, including a one-handed divot repair tool, a removable ball marker, a tee punch, and a groove cleaner. As a result, you don't need to rummage through your golf bag several times a round looking for a specific tool. At the same time, the golf tool comes with several standard Swiss Army tools--including a nail file, blade, scissors, a toothpick, and tweezers--so you can also use the golf tool for around-the-house use. As with all Victorinox items, the golf tool is made to exacting standards, with dozens of steps going into its construction. Victorinox attends to every detail, from selecting the finest materials--including stainless steel for the blades and rust-free aluminum alloy for the separators--to performing the final inspection. In addition, each individual tool has been hardened in a different way to stand up to its designated use. The golf tool carries a lifetime warranty. <b>About Swiss Army Knives</b><br> In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and \"inox,\" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility. \"", "label": 0}

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "label": 1}

You see, SwissStop pads are made by a Swiss company named Rex Articoli SA. They manufacture high-tech rubber bits for industry. In fact, SwissStop brake pads are the only consumer item that they produce. Their 70 years of experience in technical compounds allows them to produce brake pads with highly tuned performance characteristics. SwissStop pads have superior stopping power, low pad-wear rates, very linear brake response, and a smooth, quiet performance. Think of them as the Assos or the SRM of brake pads. FlashPro means one thing: These are compatible with Shimano and SRAM brake pad holders. To better the performance over the previous Flash pads, the FlashPro has deeper asymmetrical grooves and a more pronounced leading edge profile. The idea is to \"squeegee\" away more water to improve the wet weather performance and the deeper grooves help give the pads better modulation. They increased the total pad depth with more material above the wear line -- good news for those folks that live in the high mountains. The Original Black compound is SwissStop's standard all-purpose replacement pad for aluminum rims. It's ideal if you don't use carbon rims and if you don't relish the idea of riding in the rain. Please note that they do just fine in the rain, but SwissStop makes better pads for you if you find yourself in the wet stuff on a regular basis. One order gets you 4 pads total -- enough for one bike.\"", "label": 0}

Only two months later, following his graduation, Cam moved Nemo into an historic mill in Nashua, NH. A quick drive from both New Hampshire's White Mountains and the great design and business resources available from connections at RISD and MIT, Nashua was the perfect location to establish the company headquarters. Much of the first year was spent learning how to sew and pattern and developing Nemo's AirSupported Technology. Tents were chosen as Nemo's first product line because Cam saw the opportunity to bring significant new innovation to the market and knew that successfully revolutionizing tents would give Nemo the credibility to move into new product lines in the future. Since then, Nemo has won many awards in the outdoor industry, including Gear of the Year from Outside Magazine for the Losi 3P tent. Nemo contributes it's success to the brand's vision to be the leading source of product innovation for outdoor recreation and survival while using creativity to inspire respect for the planet, a love of adventure, and a love of the people and places that make adventure possible. \"", "label": 0}

There, he and the cutlers union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldiers Knife and in 1897 with the Officers Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as inoxydable\"\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.<br> <br> Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. <br> <br> <b>Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives</b><br> The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.<br> <br> <b>Sharpening</b><br> To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15 20. This will result in a cutting angle of 30 40. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.<br> <br> <b>Cleaning</b><br> After youve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher. From the renowned company that created the Swiss Army Knife a century ago comes the Swiss Army golf tool, a compact device designed specifically for the avid golfer. The golf tool comes with all the tools you need for a day on the course, including a one-handed divot repair tool, a removable ball marker, a tee punch, and a groove cleaner. As a result, you don't need to rummage through your golf bag several times a round looking for a specific tool. At the same time, the golf tool comes with several standard Swiss Army tools--including a nail file, blade, scissors, a toothpick, and tweezers--so you can also use the golf tool for around-the-house use. As with all Victorinox items, the golf tool is made to exacting standards, with dozens of steps going into its construction. Victorinox attends to every detail, from selecting the finest materials--including stainless steel for the blades and rust-free aluminum alloy for the separators--to performing the final inspection. In addition, each individual tool has been hardened in a different way to stand up to its designated use. The golf tool carries a lifetime warranty. <b>About Swiss Army Knives</b><br> In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and \"inox,\" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility. \"", "label": 0}

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Aiskaer Waterproof Bicycle Cover Outdoor Rain Protector 3 Bikes-dustproof Sunscreen.Large Size Mountain Bike Cover, Electric Bike Cover Windproof Buckle Strap\" COL feature VAL \"PREMIUM QUALITY:Made from 190T+PU coating, thicker and more durable, which protects your bike from rain, snow, dust, scratches and sun damage. completely waterproof and dustproof and Sunscreen.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "label": 0}

There, he and the cutlers union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldiers Knife and in 1897 with the Officers Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as inoxydable\"\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.<br> <br> Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. <br> <br> <b>Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives</b><br> The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.<br> <br> <b>Sharpening</b><br> To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15 20. This will result in a cutting angle of 30 40. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.<br> <br> <b>Cleaning</b><br> After youve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher. From the renowned company that created the Swiss Army Knife a century ago comes the Swiss Army golf tool, a compact device designed specifically for the avid golfer. The golf tool comes with all the tools you need for a day on the course, including a one-handed divot repair tool, a removable ball marker, a tee punch, and a groove cleaner. As a result, you don't need to rummage through your golf bag several times a round looking for a specific tool. At the same time, the golf tool comes with several standard Swiss Army tools--including a nail file, blade, scissors, a toothpick, and tweezers--so you can also use the golf tool for around-the-house use. As with all Victorinox items, the golf tool is made to exacting standards, with dozens of steps going into its construction. Victorinox attends to every detail, from selecting the finest materials--including stainless steel for the blades and rust-free aluminum alloy for the separators--to performing the final inspection. In addition, each individual tool has been hardened in a different way to stand up to its designated use. The golf tool carries a lifetime warranty. <b>About Swiss Army Knives</b><br> In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and \"inox,\" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility. \"", "label": 0}

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "label": 1}

A hygienic push button lid is simple to open and reveals a pop-up silicone straw that is comfortable to drink from. Cleaning is simple, just unscrew the lid and the straw can be completely removed and disassembled to two parts for easy cleaning.

Our hugely popular Bike Cave is a trade mark registered and patented bike tent with international registered design rights. As cycle enthusiasts ourselves, we designed TidyTent / Bike Cave to be big enough to house 2 to 3 adult size bicycles. When we designed the Bike Cave, we wanted to establish the concept of a purpose designed home for your bike, a bike storage solution that was low cost, practical, convenient, easy to assemble and quick to install. Approx 200cm (78 inches) long x 167cm (66 inches) high x 80cm (32 inches) deep. As an optional accessory to the Bike Cave we have also invented the Anka Point bike storage security bracket. The Bike Cave has a rear flap through which you can attach the AnkaPoint to a wall or fence, with its specially designed one-way anti theft security screws. Once installed you can then feed a cable lock or chain through this hardened steel bracket and around your bikes to protect them from theft. Our innovative bike tent bicycle storage solution can be installed free standing or up against a wall or fence. If you install it free-standing, we suggest you lay some old paving slabs on the internal mesh floor panel and also peg down with the stakes and guy lines included. To stand your bikes upright you can insert one of your bikes wheels into a floor bike stand. These are low cost and available at most cycle shops. If you install against a wall or fence, simply screw through the eyelets around the outer edge to the wall. The Bike Cave is designed to keep your bike dry with convenient access. Our new improved model now includes an additional roof hood for extra protection. When the fabric starts to degrade due to UV exposure you can now buy a new roof hood rather than replace the whole product. It's now made from a tougher and more durable PE tarpaulin-like fabric.

There will be no stripped set screws or lost parts. Simply remove your old, worn out pads and bolt on something better. SwissStop has over 70 years of experience in working with technical rubber compounds that allows them to produce brake pads with tuned performance characteristics. SwissStop pads have superior stopping power, low pad-wear rates, very linear brake response, and a smooth, quiet performance. Think of them as the Assos or the SRM of brake pads. FlashPro means one thing: These are compatible with Shimano and SRAM brake calipers. To better the performance over the previous Flash pads, the FlashPro has deeper asymmetrical grooves and a more pronounced leading edge profile. The idea is to \"squeegee\" away more water to improve the wet weather performance and the deeper grooves help give the pads better modulation. They increased the total pad depth with more material above the wear line -- good news for those folks that live in the high mountains. The Original Black compound is SwissStop's standard all-purpose replacement pad for aluminum rims. It's ideal if you don't use carbon rims and if you don't relish the idea of riding in the rain. Please note that they do just fine in the rain, but SwissStop makes better pads for you if you find yourself in the wet stuff on a regular basis. One order gets you 2 pads total -- enough for one wheel.\"", "label": 0}

As the leading manufacturer of convenient insulated products for over 100 years, Thermos is trusted by consumers to provide innovative portable containers that promote a safe and healthy lifestyle. Thermos delivers when it matters. Thermos brand products offer superior cold retention that keeps beverages cool and delicious for hours, and the 2465 Vacuum Insulated Hydration Bottle is no exception. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages colder, fresher, longer. This hydration bottle keeps beverages cold up to 12 hours  more than 10 times longer than an ordinary plastic water bottle. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 18 ounce bottle is virtually unbreakable and built to withstand the demands of everyday use. A comfortable silicone grip makes the bottle easy to grasp and the bottle is sized to fit most automobile cup holders. The Thermos 2465 Vacuum Insulated Hydration Bottle comes equipped with a hygienic, push-button, locking lid which can be operated easily with one hand. And because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to pre-chill the bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the bottle with cold tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. The 2465 Vacuum Insulated Hydration Bottle is made of BPA-free materials and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.\"", "label": 0}

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Token Products Lock Ring for Shimano 12T Cassette\" COL feature VAL \"TK042Sfor Shimano 12T cassette Weight: 6.0g Colour options: red, gold, black, blue\" COL description VAL \"Token Cassette Lock Ring, CNC aluminium, BC1.29\" x 24T, Shimano 12 tooth, Colour options: red, gold, black, blue, Weight: 6g.\"", "label": 0}

There will be no stripped set screws or lost parts. Simply remove your old, worn out pads and bolt on something better. SwissStop has over 70 years of experience in working with technical rubber compounds that allows them to produce brake pads with tuned performance characteristics. SwissStop pads have superior stopping power, low pad-wear rates, very linear brake response, and a smooth, quiet performance. Think of them as the Assos or the SRM of brake pads. FlashPro means one thing: These are compatible with Shimano and SRAM brake calipers. To better the performance over the previous Flash pads, the FlashPro has deeper asymmetrical grooves and a more pronounced leading edge profile. The idea is to \"squeegee\" away more water to improve the wet weather performance and the deeper grooves help give the pads better modulation. They increased the total pad depth with more material above the wear line -- good news for those folks that live in the high mountains. The Original Black compound is SwissStop's standard all-purpose replacement pad for aluminum rims. It's ideal if you don't use carbon rims and if you don't relish the idea of riding in the rain. Please note that they do just fine in the rain, but SwissStop makes better pads for you if you find yourself in the wet stuff on a regular basis.
