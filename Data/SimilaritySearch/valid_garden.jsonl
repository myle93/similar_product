It boosts the effectiveness of your pool water disinfectant, as well as aids in the prevention of scale formation, metal corrosion and the etching of pool surfaces. It helps maintain your pools pH level and eliminates pH bounce. Easy to use and dissolves quickly. Test for total alkalinity with a reliable test kit. The desired range for total alkalinity is as follows: Fiberglass Pools 70-100 ppm. Marcite, Painted, Tile, or Exposed Aggregate Pools 80-120 ppm. Vinyl Pools 120-140 ppm .

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

Year Round Production Odor Free Operation Expandable up to 7 trays\" COL description VAL \"Worm composting is an incredibly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for your garden. Master gardeners agree that compost produced by worms will produce the best results and help your plants thrive. The Worm Factory's unique stackable, multi-tray design makes it the most efficient worm bin composter around. Worms begin eating waste in the lowest tray, and then migrate upward as food sources in that tray are exhausted. By allowing worms to migrate upward, the worms separate themselves from the finished compost that is ready for the garden. Besides the worm castings that are produced through this process, the Worm Factory also produces a second type of compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through your Worm Factory, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer, know as leachate is gathered in the special collection tray of the Worm Factory and can easily be drained from the spigot. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrient rich compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system taking nutrient-rich particles with it. You can drain organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. It's compact square design gives the Worm Factory the smallest footprint of all worm composters. The Worm Factory's tray stacking system allows it to hold the largest capacity of compost in the smallest amount of space, making it the perfect composter for anyone with space limitations. The Worm Factory is simple to operate. When full, each tray weighs only 12.5 pounds making lifting and arranging trays effortless. The included 38-page instruction manual and instructional DVD makes setup fast and easy and gives tips on how to best manage your Worm Factory composter year-round.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Useful UH-GB170 30 Gallon Hard Shell Bottom Pop-Up Gardening Bag or Camping trash can with Zip Closed Lid\" COL feature VAL \"Collapsible, stand-alone container ideal for yard waste, debris collection Hardshell bottom to accommodate heavy loads Durable polyvinyl and polyester construction Cushioned handles, toggle-and-loop closure system 2 inches in height when collapsed, 23 inches high, 19-inch diameter when open, 1-year warranty\" COL description VAL \"Make outdoor cleanup chores quick and convenient Useful. 30-gallon premium gardening container provides an easy way to clean up weeds, grass clippings, other types of yard waste, or even items like toys or laundry fresh off the clothesline.

The material, design, and construction, are simply the best on the market. Outdoor furniture covers need to breathe so that moisture can escape, keeping mold and mildew from developing under the cover.

Koverroos covers are stronger than most vinyl covers, yet light weight. This means our covers are easy to use - no struggling to get them on and off. Also, these patio furniture covers are able to handle temperatures from -100 degrees Fahrenheit up to +240 degrees. The KoverRoos III Deep 2-Seat Sofa Cover Large is appropriate for most weather conditions as it maintains all of the great features of Dupont Tyvek; however, KoverRoos III offers better durability, good for slightly harsher or windier climates.

This basic-but-beautiful model has two stainless-steel burners and practical features like stainless-steel side tables that fold down when you aren't using them. The grill's porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates combine the ease of porcelain enamel with the superior heat retention of cast iron. The grates require no seasoning and are easy to clean. Providing plenty of space to grill up all those summertime--or year round--favorites, the unit offers a 26,500-BTU-per-hour input, and its total capacity consists of 450 square inches of cooking space (a 360-square-inch primary cooking area and a 90-square-inch warming rack). The grill also provides porcelain-enameled Flavorizer bars, a center-mounted thermometer, an enclosed cart, and a stainless-steel shroud that can withstand the elements for durability from one year to the next. Other highlights include six tool hooks, two heavy-duty front-locking casters, and two heavy-duty back swivel casters. Requiring a 20-pound LP tank (not included) to operate, the gas grill's fuel gauge lets you know exactly where you stand on fuel at all times (LP only). Notice how sturdy the shroud feels as it opens smoothly on its hinges? See how the burners roar to life on the very first try? Delighted by how simple it is to achieve a mouthwatering meal every time? It's no accident. Weber spends countless hours perfecting the grilling systems on its gas grills, assuring easy assembly, an evenly heated cooking surface, and precision controls so you can tone things down or up to the perfect heat level for direct or indirect cooking. The cookbox houses the components of the cooking system: cooking grates, burner tubes, Favorizer Bars, and the grease management system. Made of cast aluminum, Weber's gas-grill cookboxes are durable, efficient, require minimal care and maintenance, and can withstand the heat needed to grill at any temperature. In addition, the shape of the cookbox, when combined with the shroud, allows for the proper circulation of heat around food for even cooking whether you're using direct or indirect heat. Weber gas-grill cooking grates come in three exceptional materials: porcelain-enameled steel, stainless steel, and porcelain-enameled cast iron. Each type retains heat evenly and sears food beautifully. Porcelain-enameled steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean. Stainless steel rod cooking grates make lovely sear marks, hold heat very well, and clean up with ease. Porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates combine the ease of porcelain-enameled with the superior heat retention of cast iron--no need to season and easy to clean. Weber's burners are made of high-grade stainless steel, which will stand up to the small amounts of water found in liquid propane and natural gas. The burner tubes are made of a singular piece of steel with no welds, making them stronger and more resistant to rust and burn-through. And while they are protected from grease drippings and food by the Flavorizer bars, Weber cart gas grill burner tubes can be cleaned easily by gently brushing with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush. Controls for each burner give you the ability to grill by the direct or indirect method. Even more, the burners are spaced to provide heat across the entire cooking grate, and the burner valves have infinite control settings, so you can fine-tune the heat levels. The innovative Flavorizer bar system, originally created by Weber, is designed perfectly to perform a variety of functions on the Spirit , Genesis, and Summit gas grills. Angled just right, the Flavorizer bars catch drippings that smoke and sizzle, adding flavor to your food. Any drippings not vaporized by the Flavorizer bars follow the slope of their unique angle and are funneled away from the burner tubes, down into the grease management system. Not only does this help prevent flare-ups inside your grill, but it also protects the burner tubes from becoming clogged. Made of either porcelain enamel or stainless steel, Flavorizer bars are durable, long lasting, and easy to care for. Periodically brushing them clean with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush will help keep Flavorizer bars performing at their best. When juices drip off the meat, they funnel down to the Flavorizer bars, and then what doesn't vaporize into wonderful smoke goes down into the grease management system. The grease management system consists of an angled grease tray and catch pan. The grease tray rests beneath the cookbox a safe distance from the burner tubes to prevent the grease from catching fire. Grease is channeled down the grease tray and into the catch pan. Both the grease tray and catch pan are easy to clean. The tray easily slides out of the cabinet for cleaning, and when the catch pan starts to fill, simply remove the disposable drip pan, toss it in the trash, and replace it with an empty pan. A fuel gauge lets you know exactly where you stand on fuel at all times. When George Stephen created the first Weber grill, he wanted to be able to bring his family together for a good meal. He insisted on a product that would exceed customers' expectations. In the years since then, the Weber name has become synonymous with backyard barbecues and the family, friends, and good times that go with them. At Weber, they continue that tradition of excellence in everything they do from the development of new grills and accessories to the services they provide to customer and dealers. From the very beginning, Weber revolutionized backyard grilling. Since then, they have continued to develop products that enhance the grilling experience. From the original kettle with heat controlling dampers to electronic temperature controls and Flavorizer bars, Weber continues to be at the forefront of modern grilling, making the backyard a part of your kitchen. Weber grills have been and will continue to be the true definition of performance in backyard grilling. Whether you're cooking a basic burger or an extensive meal, Weber grills are designed and engineered to give you the best performance every time. Service is of the utmost importance at Weber. Their Customer and Dealer Service associates work every day to ensure that their customers and dealers have the support they need.\"", "label": 0}

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to track to their original origins. <i>OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED</i> By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria.

What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell? <i>IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS</i> Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet. This means that each individual pellet is a blend. Most competitors merely blend different flavored pellets together in the bag.

Give them some room to spread out by spacing them about 5-6 inches apart. You can also plant the bulbs in pots on patios, decks or window boxes. Just make sure that they do have access to water. Alternately, you could plant them on pots and enjoy seeing them come up indoors. The flowers wont last as long as they will outside but a single or small group of potted hyacinths are sure way to bring spring inside! <b>Maintenance:</b>Water the ground well, after you plant the bulbs.

As with all spring bulbs, hyacinths sprout, bloom and start to fade into dormancy before deciduous trees fully leaf out, so you don't have to worry about too much shade from nearby trees. <b>Mature Size:</b> 6-12 inches (h) x 4-9 inches (w) <b>Bloom Period:</b> Late Winter - Early Spring <b>Soil: </b>Hyacinth do best in a soil that is neutral to slightly acidic. They will not tolerate wet soils.  <b>Planting Hyacinth Bulbs in the Ground: </b>Hyacinth bulbs contain a substance that can cause an itchy skin reaction in some people. If you are sensitive, where gloves when handling the bulbs. Most varieties of hyacinth bulbs are fairly large. Plant them pointed end up, about 3 times as deep as they are wide. For most, this will be 7-8 inches deep. They can be planted less deeply in warmer areas, where they will need to be dug and chilled, if you want them to bloom again. Give them some room to spread out by spacing them about 5-6 inches apart. You can also plant the bulbs in pots on patios, decks or window boxes. Just make sure that they do have access to water. Alternately, you could plant them on pots and enjoy seeing them come up indoors. The flowers wont last as long as they will outside but a single or small group of potted hyacinths  are sure way to bring spring inside!\"", "label": 1}

The Worm Factory 360 composting system makes the entire process quick and easy. With a thermo siphon air flow design, the Worm Factory 360 increases the composting speed. Now you can produce compost much faster than traditional composting methods. This version of the Worm Factory 360 comes in black, and it's also available in green and terracotta. Americans throw away 34 million tons of food waste into landfills each year, more than any other type of waste (EPA.gov). While traditional backyard composting has its place, the process can take up to two years and rotating it can become a chore. Worm composting uses worms to do the work of breaking down waste and is more efficient and easier to manage than a traditional backyard compost pile. In addition, its compact design makes it perfect for use in any household. Worm composting makes it easy to recycle kitchen scraps, paper waste and cardboard into nutrient-rich fertilizer for your plants, creating a more sustainable lifestyle by recycling and improving soil quality. The Worm Factory 360 houses thousands of composting worms in a compact space. These worms work 24/7 to efficiently produce highly beneficial, rich compost packed with microbes and water-soluble plant nutrients. This eliminates all the work of traditional composting and yields a much more valuable end product. Worm compost has been proven to have ten times the nutrients of traditional backyard compost. The more nutrients that are available to your plants, the larger they grow and the more bountiful your harvest is. This system allows you to enjoy <strong>organic</strong> vegetables, fruits, and flowers grown with the help of your kitchen scraps. &nbsp; The Worm Factory 360 is simple to set up and operate. Managing your Worm Factory 360 takes less than 15 minutes a week. Included with each Worm Factory 360 are a comprehensive instruction guide and DVD that make setup easy and give detailed tips on how to best manage your new Worm Factory 360 year-round. Start with just the bottom tray and bedding material included. Add 1lb of composting worms and start filling the tray with household waste. The worms will process and recycle the waste into fine compost full of nutrients. When the first tray is full, stack another on top. Each tray has a grid bottom, so worms migrate upward as new food is added. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This makes it possible to harvest organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. &nbsp; Adding household waste to the Worm Factory 360 is easy; just open the lid and toss the food in. Fruits, vegetables, grains, paper, eggshells, leaves, coffee grounds and more can be added. Three foods to avoid are diary, meat, and citrus items; these can be harmful to the worms and are difficult to compost. Feed your worms about 50 percent food scraps and 50 percent fiber and paper. This creates the optimal environment for worms and finished compost. The goal is to recycle what you usually throw away. Don't worry about feeding your worms every day. Some people feed them a handful a week; some people feed them a handful a day. The general rule of thumb is worms can eat about half their weight in food per day. This means that if you start with 1 pound of worms, they can eat a half pound of food per day. Worms can survive up to two weeks without any additional food. Just feed them a bit extra before going on long vacations. In a healthy environment, composting worms will maintain their population without over or under populating. &nbsp; Your waste production isn't seasonal and your composting efforts shouldn't be either! Composting is no longer limited to the warm months. The Worm Factory 360 can be used indoors or outdoors, allowing year round operation. When managed correctly, the Worm Factory 360 is odorless, making it the perfect composter for apartments, kitchens, condos, garages, porches and more! Because of its unique design, the Worm Factory 360 allows oxygen to flow through the system, discouraging stinky garbage odors. It is important to note that worms are living creatures, and cannot tolerate extreme temperatures. Keep the Worm Factory 360 so that the bedding remains between 40 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or where you would personally feel comfortable. The Worm Factory 360 is expandable vertically, allowing a high compost capacity while maintaining a very small footprint. When full, each tray weighs 12.5 pounds, making lifting and arranging trays effortless. &nbsp; Your first tray will take about three months to become fully composted by the worms. After the first tray is composted the other trays can take as little as a month depending on the waste added. Once you harvest your finished compost from the bottom tray, you will have an empty tray to stack on top again. The nutrient-rich finished compost can be used in your garden, raised beds, container gardens, or on houseplants. Even if you're not a gardener, the Worm Factory 360 helps you reduce your impact and provides an alternative to throwing your waste into the landfill. Worm compost not only adds vital nutrients to your soil, it also conditions the soil to hold water longer, prevent plant disease, and promote healthy root growth. Take one step in the green direction with the Worm Factory 360 and create a healthier, happier environment. &nbsp;  All models available in black, terracotta, and green\"", "label": 0}

It is a highly effective Deicer & Preventer in temperatures up to -40. It will last longer and require fewer applications then other brands found at retail stores. <br> <b>Directions:</b> <br> <b>Liquid Deicer:</b> Spray or pour onto Snow or Ice accumulations at a rate of 1 to 3 gallons per 1000 SF. This fluid works best when applied in narrow bands to minimize dilution from melting. This liquid ice melt will penetrate to the pavement to break the bonds of ice and snow prior to mechanical removal. <br> <b>Aid to Solid Deicers:</b> Liquid ice melt is also used as an aid to solid deicers in heavy ice situations. A solid deicer is first applied to punch holes in the ice, Then this product is applied over the top which will penetrate the holes to the surface breaking the ice to pavement bond so mechanical removal can be easily accomplished. <br> <b>Ice Prevention:</b> Treating surfaces before snow & ice occur will form a high traction film to prevent adhesion of ice and snow, which is then mechanically removed. Apply at a rate of 1/2 to 1 Gallon per 1000 SF. <br> <b>Pre-Wetting Agent:</b> Use as pre-wetter for solid ice melt products. Because this liquid ice melt has a very low freezing point it significantly improves the performance of solids and does not clog spray nozzles. Salt and other granular ice melts need moisture to start working. Many granular ice melters can not begin melting snow and ice in very low temperatures. By pre-wetting with this product, the liquid portion will begin melting snow immediately allowing the granular ice melts to do their job.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Plastic Roof Ice Guard Mini Snow Guard (25 Pack)Prevent Sliding Snow Ice Buildup-Acrylic\" COL feature VAL \"Stop snow from sliding off your roof.

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"3PK Charcoal Starter\" COL feature VAL \"Versatile and easy-to-use packs of charcoal briquette starter for grills, camp stoves, charcoal chimneys, RV Parks Light up to 75 coals quickly on with a single serving and cook without flare-ups or the smell and taste of lighter fluid Made from recycled wood, volcanic rock and a patented blend of food-grade paraffin wax-no harmful chemicals or vapors Safe-to-store, nonvolatile formula with shelf life of 30 years and no risk of flare ups, explosions, or flammable-storage concerns Leftover ash is an environmentally friendly fertilizer that nourishes the earth <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 It had to be safe.             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 It had to be easy for anyone to use.             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 It had to work the same every time.             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 No harmful chemicals.             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Burns at 1000 degrees.             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Light up to 75 briquettes at time.             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 For use with charcoal chimney, traditional grills and ceramic grills.             </span>\" COL description VAL \"InstaFire charcoal briquette starter is optimal for lighting coals to grill on your home barbecue, at a camp site, while tailgating at a game, or anywhere you want to have a cookout.

Catchmaster 288i Rev C - ( Revision C stands for Consumer Market). Made by Catchmaster for Traps Direct Same Catchmaster Quality as used by Professionals, but in a discrete package to blend into your surroundings. Used and recommended by researchers at the University of Kansas, the head researcher said &quot;Over and over again the Catchmaster traps come through. Even when traps are crowded and full, the Catchmaster brand catches recluse by as little as one leg.&quot; The simple conclusion is: the more traps you set, the more spiders will be caught. Some companies sell small numbers of large traps, but it&apos;s more effective and economical to set a large number of small traps. Larger traps aren&apos;t more effective because it&apos;s the edge of a trap that catches a spider anyway. 5 Reasons why Traps Direct Catchmaster Glue Traps are excellent for controlling Brown Recluse spider &amp; insect populations in your home: 1. Redesigned Trap Surface hides the marketing messages on the bottom replacing the matrix and logos with a discrete dark green pebble abstract that blends into surroundings {Photos compare the standard 288i (red) to 288iRevC (green). Which would you rather in your space?} 2. While Brown Recluse spider infestations are thought by many to be impossible to eliminate, research at the University of Kansas has shown that &quot;effective population management is possible&quot; with Catchmaster 288i glue traps, 3. Glue traps get rid of spiders in places where it may not be safe to spray pesticides such as inside food cabinets. 4. Pesticide applications can actually be detrimental. Studies show that Brown Recluse spiders will prefer dead insects over living ones. You give them a feast. 5. Inexpensive to use.

There are two types of bamboo clumping & running. Generally clumping bamboo grows from a central stem and does not spread. However, for the running bamboo you will need barriers to contain it in most soils. Once planted bamboo grows very quickly, thus the need to control the running roots systems. Natural containment is not always adequate for running bamboo. For an aggressive horizontal root system a physical barrier is required to stop the unwanted migration of running root systems. This is where Villa Bamboo Barrier comes to the rescue. Properly installed at a minimum of 2 feet with an ideal depth of 3 to 4 feet, this should control most running root systems.\"", "label": 0}

According to researchers at Cornell and Clemson universities, when tomatoes are grown on red mulch they have higher yields, stronger stems and ripen earlier.

It is the color of the mulch that changes the intensity of certain wave lengths of light that in turn has an impact on plant growth and subsequent yields. Studies by Penn State University show tomato yields have been as much as 20% higher with red plastic mulch than with black. Red mulch reflects intensified red light to the developing plants which increases their photosynthetic capacity. There is more reflectivity early in the season when more of the mulch is exposed to light.

An average of 18 minutes is spent processing each bag of aggregate before it reaches your door. Some aggregates require 20 minutes per gallon. <br> A perfect tree in the perfect soil can still suffer. Factors such as water PH and fertilizer are additional variables to consider. We provide products backed by real science. Its important to apply this science to your local environment. What works in one city may not work the best in another. <br> All of Bonsai Jack soil products are state inspected and tested on a regular basis in order to comply with interstate regulations. This ensures you receive material free of dangerous pathogens that can damage or kill bonsai trees. This is also required to maintain nursery stamps that permit interstate shipments. <br> These regulations play an important part in preventing the spread of harmful critters such as IFA's (Imported Fire Ant's), Nematodes and Wood Borers.

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"J.C.'s Smoking Wood Chunks - Gallon Sized bag - Pecan\" COL feature VAL \"Smoking chunks for grilling, use in your smoker box or just add to your gas or charcoal grill Made from Virgin Hardwood Trees from Central Iowa and Missouri\" COL description VAL \"Gallon Sized bag of Pecan wood chunks for the ultimate smoking experience\"", "label": 0}

This impressive, wide-ranging species tolerates an amazing diversity of climates, altitudes, and soils, and can live for centuries, growing to heights of over 300 feet, with soaring, column-like trunks more than 8 feet across. A slow grower in its first decade, Ponderosa Pine grows faster as it ages, ultimately acquiring a magnificent physique, characterized by muscular branches; burnished tufts of long, green-gold needles (5\"  13\"); large, cinnamon-red cones; and a regal-looking, almost perfectly straight trunk, richly clad in great plates of bronze-colored bark.

We made a test for the turbo nozzle: we kept it working without any interrupt, and it worked only for 120 hours until it's dead because it generated a high temperature which ruined the turbo core. So our suggestion is that do not keep using it for a long time. If you use it properly(incontinuously), its working life would expand to 500H at least. So treat it like a baby!<br> 2. If your equipment is of high pressure but low flow, the nozzle can be damaged. If your equipment is of big flow but small pressure, your cleaning ability will be reduced. Please note that nozzle fan degree does not effect nozzle size selection.SO please check whether the pressure of your equipment is under the 5000PSI and make the most to keep it working under 4300PSI<br> 3. To ensure no leaks you must wrap PTFE tape to the screw thread. You should wrap it on the opposite side of the rotating direction. Please note the PFTE tape is NOT INCLUDED in the package. 4. It's normal that there are some rust spots on the products because of our techology and please note it's originally packaged sent but not used.\"", "label": 1}

No scraping needed. Easily steam away baked-on food, grease, and black residue. And best of all, brushes won't gunk up. Specially designed to clean and sanitize grills safely and thoroughly, the Grill Daddy Pro keeps all grills looking brand new and keeps food tasting great. The amazing Grill Daddy Pro releases a measured amount of water that turns to grease-melting steam the instant it touches your preheated grill. This powerful sanitizing, liquefying action literally melts away charred buildup. Just glide the stainless-steel brush along the grill. Use the double-duty scraper brush for tough grime and hard-to-clean areas. Unlike any other brush, the patented Grill Daddy Pro is made from high-temperature heat-resistant ABS plastic and approved by the National Safety Foundation (NSF) for use with potable water. Brush heads are dishwasher-safe and safe to use on stainless steel, ceramic, and iron grills. At 22 inches from end to end, the Grill Daddy Pro is the longest grill brush on the market. It is specially designed to protect your hands from grill heat while cleaning large hot grills and features two ergonomic handles that provide maximum cleaning leverage even when cleaning the back of big grills. Plus, with its 2-cup water capacity, the Grill Daddy Pro delivers tons of steam to clean even the largest grill without having to refill. The Grill Daddy Pro will also keep its beautiful silver surface for years to come, as it is UV stabilized to withstand the elements. A must for winter grilling. Simply preheat the grill, fill your Grill Daddy Pro with water (water valve should be in the off position while filling), turn on the water valve and brush away caked on food residue and grease. As you brush, the Grill Daddy Pro releases just the right amount of water; the water hits the hot grill, turns to steam, and rinses away burnt-on food, grease, and grime. For more steam, loosen the fill cap. For hard-to-clean areas, flip the brush over to release water from the patented scraper brush and use the scraper brush in a cross-wise direction to bust-up and melt-away even the most stubborn, baked-on residue with the power of steam. No more toxic chemicals. No more back-breaking work. The Grill Daddy Pro gives you a sparkling clean grill in minutes. Equipped with a handy hang-hook, the Grill Daddy Pro can be conveniently stored away and ready to go when you are. Note: After each use empty excess water and leave the On/Off Valve in the on position. Built to last with their heavy-gauge stainless-steel bristles, these brushes can really take it. They're dishwasher-safe and guaranteed not to gunk up. And they easily pop on and off. Plus, there are five specialty attachments (sold separately), each designed to deliver maximum cleaning power.

How's this for nonstop color from spring through fall Every leaf of this delightful new Rose of Sharon is splashed with creamy white (beginning pale yellow in spring and lightening as the sun grows more intense in summer) around the edges, giving the plant its name of Sugar Tip .

These flowers are as lovely and many-petaled as Roses, boasting a pale lilac-influenced shade of pearly-pink that adds a cooling note to the blazing summer garden. Sugar Tip is sterile, so instead of putting out a few blooms and then making seed, it spends all its energy setting new buds. The result is MONTHS of nonstop blooms lasting all the way through early fall in most climates and even later in areas where frost comes late or not at all. Like most Hibiscus, Sugar Tip is eager to grow and absolutely determined to bloom, no matter what the weather does.

MELTS & PREVENTS Ice, Frost & Snow NON TOXIC Safe for Pets WILL NOT harm vegetation or lawns NON STAINING Formula leaves no residue on floors\" COL description VAL \"This Concentrated Liquid Calcium Chloride is used for customers that need a fast acting product in extreme temperatures. It is a highly effective Deicer & Preventer in temperatures up to -40. It will last longer and require fewer applications then other brands found at retail stores. <br> <b>Directions:</b> <br> <b>Liquid Deicer:</b> Spray or pour onto Snow or Ice accumulations at a rate of 1 to 3 gallons per 1000 SF. This fluid works best when applied in narrow bands to minimize dilution from melting. This liquid ice melt will penetrate to the pavement to break the bonds of ice and snow prior to mechanical removal. <br> <b>Aid to Solid Deicers:</b> Liquid ice melt is also used as an aid to solid deicers in heavy ice situations. A solid deicer is first applied to punch holes in the ice, Then this product is applied over the top which will penetrate the holes to the surface breaking the ice to pavement bond so mechanical removal can be easily accomplished. <br> <b>Ice Prevention:</b> Treating surfaces before snow & ice occur will form a high traction film to prevent adhesion of ice and snow, which is then mechanically removed. Apply at a rate of 1/2 to 1 Gallon per 1000 SF. <br> <b>Pre-Wetting Agent:</b> Use as pre-wetter for solid ice melt products. Because this liquid ice melt has a very low freezing point it significantly improves the performance of solids and does not clog spray nozzles. Salt and other granular ice melts need moisture to start working. Many granular ice melters can not begin melting snow and ice in very low temperatures. By pre-wetting with this product, the liquid portion will begin melting snow immediately allowing the granular ice melts to do their job.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Plastic Roof Ice Guard Mini Snow Guard (100 Pack) Prevent Sliding Snow Ice Buildup BROWN\" COL feature VAL \"Stop snow from sliding off your roof.

We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products. <i>FIBER QUALITY</i> What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell? <i>IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS</i> Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet. This means that each individual pellet is a blend. Most competitors merely blend different flavored pellets together in the bag. The problem with mixing different pellets together is each wood type burns differently making them harder for you to get a consistent smoke. With our blended pellet method, it ensures that each pellet burns the same for a more consistent smoke.\"", "label": 0}

This in turn leads to the fuel/air mixture injected into the cylinder being more cleanly consumed, lessening the level of greenhouse gases emitted, increasing energy efficiency and generating more horsepower. <style type=\"text/css\"> .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; } </style> <table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"210\"> <tbody> <tr> <td height=\"44\" valign=\"top\"><img alt=\"The E3 Spark Plug logo\" height=\"69\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/e3.sparkplug.logo.200.jpg\" title=\"The E3 Spark Plug logo\" width=\"200\" /><br /> <small><center><strong><em></em></strong></center></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"310\"> <tbody> <tr> <td height=\"194\" valign=\"top\"> <div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B000BPOI8O.01.lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=463,height=449'); return false;\"><img align=\"top\" alt=\"E3 Lawn &amp; Garden and Small Engine spark plug\" border=\"0\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B000BPOI8O.01.sm.jpg\" title=\"E3 Lawn &amp; Garden and Small Engine spark plug\" width=\"300\" /></a><br /></div> <center><span class=\"caption\">Breakthrough technology for small engines.<br /> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B000BPOI8O.01.lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=463,height=449'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</span> </center></td> </tr> <tr> <td height=\"271\" valign=\"top\"> <div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/e3.sparkplug.02.lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=733,height=592'); return false;\"><img align=\"top\" alt=\"Bar graph showing significant emissions reductions possible with the use of E3 spark plugs\" border=\"0\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/e3.sparkplug.02.sm.jpg\" title=\"Bar graph showing significant emissions reductions possible with the use of E3 spark plugs\" width=\"300\" /></a><br /></div> <center><span class=\"caption\">Fewer emissions, with more power and better fuel efficiency.<br /> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/e3.sparkplug.02.lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=733,height=592'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</span> </center></td> </tr> <tr> <td height=\"252\" valign=\"top\"> <div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B000BPOI8O.02.lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=870,height=544'); return false;\"><img align=\"top\" alt=\"Upgrade and compatibility chart for E3 Lawn &amp; Garden and Small Engine spark plug models\" border=\"0\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B000BPOI8O.02.sm.jpg\" title=\"Upgrade and compatibility chart for E3 Lawn &amp; Garden and Small Engine spark plug models\" width=\"300\" /></a><br /></div> <center><span class=\"caption\">Easily upgraded to from any existing plug.<br /> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B000BPOI8O.02.lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=870,height=544'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</span> </center></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Why You Need E3 Spark Plugs</strong><br /> As the designated catalyst for the ignition of fuel in small engines, spark plugs are a small, but constant factor in the workings of the vast majority of lawn and garden tools utilizing such motors. What owners of these tools may not realize is that their choice of spark plug could play a significant role in reducing the level of greenhouse gases that their engines give off, as well as increasing their overall fuel economy and potential power output. This is where E3 Spark Plug's DiamondFire technology comes in. <strong>DiamondFire Technology</strong><br /> For the last 100 years, the only real advance in consumer spark plug technology has been to develop ways to make them cheaper. E3 Spark Plug's DiamondFire technology changes all of that through an improved electrode design that provides for more efficient burning of your engine's air/fuel vapor, leading to more pressure in the cylinder. These improvements are measurable, confirmed and based on the following design elements found in existing performance spark plugs. First, the DiamondFire electrode directs the flame kernel to the piston more directly, reducing the travel time from the spark zone to the end gases via the open section at the top of the electrode. Given the short time available to get combustion started, the faster you can get the flame to the piston, the better. Second, the physical features of the electrode project further forward into the combustion chamber. This brings the spark zone closer to areas of probable \"good\" air/fuel mixture and also creates beneficial \"micro-aerodynamics\" within the spark zone. The initial combustion wave leaves the spark area at supersonic speeds above Mach 1, and the elevated edge provides a kind of chimney effect so the next round of air/fuel mixture gets into the spark zone more easily. Finally, the E3 electrode design features forced edge-to-edge spark discharge, which is the best way to get a spark to leave a surface. This improves upon the phenomena that drove race car drivers to \"cut back\" ordinary electrode spark plugs in order to improve the spark discharge. The spark itself occurs only when an avalanche of electrons migrates from the two electrodes (anode to cathode). Sharp edges are better at initiating electron migrations, and these accelerated electrons collide with matter inside the spark zone to release additional electrons. This design ensures that the whole population of electrons works to create a plasma channel through which the spark current flows more easily, resulting in an increase in both power output and fuel economy, while reducing emissions in gasoline engines and the build up of carbon deposits on engine surfaces. <strong>Key Features</strong>: <strong>Limited Warranty</strong><br /> E3 small engine spark plugs properly installed in noncommercial equipment, for household purposes are warranted to provide better performance than standard spark plugs, to properly discharge a spark, and to be free of defects in material or workmanship, for the life of the first engine in which they are installed. In the event of provable defect within the stated warranty period, the manufacturer will either replace the item(s), or refund the purchase price at their discretion. <strong>About Pyrotek E3</strong><br /> Headquartered in Point Vedra, Florida, Pyrotek E3, d.b.a. E3 Spark Plugs, was formed to help customers increase power, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce engine emissions that contribute to global warming. Their advanced DiamondFire electrode design burns fuel more efficiently and completely, increasing mileage, horsepower and drastically cutting toxic emissions.  The DiamondFIRE ground electrode configuration increases the amount of combustion pressure created during each power stroke of an engine, which results in a marked increase in power output, fuel economy, and reduced emissions in all gasoline engines. Smoother Acceleration and Idle  The faster flame propagation initiated by the Patented DiamondFIRE ground electrode results in a more complete burn of the fuel/air mixture. Energy  More pressure is created against the cylinder and more of the available fuel is put to work. Power is improved 3%-6% on average in typical operating ranges. Results may vary. Efficiency  Another benefit of E3s faster flame propagation is less fuel is wasted, resulting in improved fuel efficiency. Lab and Dyno testing typically results in 3%-4% improved Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC). Results may vary. Ecology  E3s more complete burn drastically reduces carbon emissions and carbon build up. As the designated catalyst for the ignition of fuel in gasoline powered cars, trucks, motorcycles and small engines, spark plugs are a small, but constant factor in the workings of the vast majority of motorists on the road. What these motorists may not know is that their choice of spark plug could play a significant role in reducing the level of greenhouse gases that their vehicles give off, as well as increasing overall fuel economy and potential power output.

Made using the bark and cambium layer of trees. This is the area where the most flavor in a tree resides. Made in a smaller diameter to create a hotter burn and more smoke with more surface area. Available in a multitude of flavors including pure and blended mixtures Made in the USA\" COL description VAL \"We are an actual manufacturing plant that uses real trees and processes them into our products. We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990).\"", "label": 0}

The high-heat, fast-start wand can light charcoal briquettes, wood chips, chunks or pellets with ease. Two simple switches take your charcoal from cold to smoldering in a matter of minutes: the heat setting ignites, while the blow setting distributes the flames to unlit charcoal. The starter also has a built-in kickstand to prop the hot wand off of its resting surface. The wand's stainless steel tip has a higher melting point than other metals, allowing it to be buried directly into the coals, and its tapered tip focuses heat effectively. And once your coals are lit, you can even insert woodchips into the tip of the wand to heat the chips and blow smoky flavor directly onto your food. The Fire Up Charcoal Starter Wand is an excellent value as well. Get your charcoal started without breaking the bank. HOW TO USE: Plug in torch cord to a grounded electrical outlet (120V~, 1500W, 60Hz). Point nozzle directly at single piece of charcoal, no farther than 3 inches away. Flip switch to '1' to ignite the charcoal. Once charcoal is lit, flip switch to '2' to blow hot air onto the surrounding coals. If you are lighting a large amount of charcoal, consider igniting more than one charcoal to make sure the fire spreads evenly across your coals. After removing wand from the charcoal, unplug the wand and place it on its kickstand to cool. Let Starter Wand cool completely on a heat-safe surface before storing. CARE: Store indoors when not in use.\"", "label": 0}

The clever multi-chamber system saves you from turning over the compost and features large filling and removal flaps with Snap-On wind protection. This compost bin has adjustable ventilation for air control in summer and winter. The Aero plus 6000 features composting in 3 stages. In the 1st stage, food and garden waste is collected and mixed with only low ventilation (anaerobic). This has proved to prevent from annoying insects like wasps and flies and to bring a greater mass of waste at one time to the 2nd stage by opening the discharge flap. In the 2nd stage it is digested rapidly with generous ventilation, generating heat up to 70 degrees c (158 f), thereby destroying weeds. Here, the waste looses a lot of volume, so the 2nd stage has a capacity of approximately 3x that of the first cabin. When the 2nd stage is filled, it is very comfortably moved to the 3rd stage, at the same time mixed and aerated by the turning the outside handle which turns the shelf. In the 3rd stage, the digested and cooled down compost is maturing in intense contact with earth and the myriads of useful organisms therein. As new waste is separated from mature compost by the 3-stage system and due to the turning bottom, the mature compost is not compressed - removal is clean & easy through the two large discharge flaps/doors on opposite sides at the bottom camber of the composter.

Worm compost has been proven to have ten times the nutrients of traditional backyard compost. In addition, its compact design makes it perfect for use in any household. Worm composting makes it easy to recycle kitchen scraps, paper waste and cardboard into nutrient rich fertilizer for your plants, creating a more sustainable lifestyle. The worms work 24/7 to efficiently produce highly beneficial, rich compost packed with microbes and water soluble plant nutrients. The Worm Factory 360 is simple to set up and operate. Managing your Worm Factory 360 takes less than 15 minutes a week. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste such as kitchen scraps and shredded paper to the bottom tray of the Worm Factory 360. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrientrich compost. You can do this yearround inside or outside, and harvest compost up to once a month! Your first tray will take about three months to become fully composted by the worms. After the first tray is composted the other trays can take as little as a month depending on the waste added. Once you harvest your finished compost from the bottom tray, you will have an empty tray to stack on top again. The nutrientrich finished compost can be used in your garden, raised beds, container gardens, or on houseplants. Even if youre not a gardener, the Worm Factory 360 helps you reduce your impact and provides an alternative to throwing your waste into the landfill.\"", "label": 0}

Its small format fits easily on balconies and small patios - great for places that propane or charcoal grills aren't allowed. And although the grill is compact, its ample cooking grate is large enough to cook most family meals - 8 steaks, 8 hamburgers, 6 - 10 chicken breasts, or over 4 lbs. of fish! The grill heats up very quickly, and reaches temperatures high enough to sear a steak to perfection. The novel VersaStand telescoping base quickly transforms the grill from storage to tabletop to floor standing use, allowing the chef to enjoy grilling at a comfortable height. The stand is integrated into the grill for added convenience - making easy to store when finished. The grill plugs into a standard household electrical receptacle, and is UL approved for outdoor use. Innovative culinary tools are the Cuisinart signature. The prestigious Cuisinart brand is not limited to their famous food processors - plugged or unplugged, nobody covers the modern chef like Cuisinart. Cuisinart is a full-service culinary resource with a wide array of products, preferred by chefs and favored by consumers. And now you can take the world famous Cuisinart brand to your patio, lawn, tailgate, or campsite with their comprehensive line of Cuisinart outdoor grilling products available now on Amazon. <div class = aplus> Most people love the flavor of grilled food, but not everyone has the space for a large gas grill or the time to grill with charcoal. Enter the CEG-980 electric grill, a handy, attractive alternative to traditional grilling. Equipped with a telescoping VersaStand, the CEG-980 combines the simplicity of an indoor appliance with the delicious cooking performance of an outdoor grill, making it ideal for people who love cooking outdoors but don't want to deal with the hassle of propane or charcoal. Traditional gas and charcoal grills offer a wide variety of styles and designs--from large multi-burner gas grills with built-in islands to barrel-like charcoal grills--but sometimes prove to be too large, too intimidating, or too inconvenient for would-be outdoor chefs. While gas grills are certainly handy, some people find it discomforting and dangerous to cook with propane. Charcoal grills, while perhaps less intimidating, take considerable time to light and prepare, and can be messy to clean up afterward. Plus, some apartments and condos ban the use of propane or charcoal altogether. Electric grills minimize all of the above concerns, with instant-on controls, easy-to-clean designs, and no smelly gas or messy charcoal to get in the way of your cooking. The grilling process begins with the easiest fuel source you can find--a simple cord and outlet--along with a removable electric probe with a control knob that functions just like the knobs on most kitchen stoves. To get started, just plug the probe into the front of the grill and turn the knob to \"Max.\" Within five minutes, the heating element will be glowing a toasty red and the grill will be ready for cooking. When you're finished grilling, the knob turns off just as easily. And cleanup couldn't be easier, as the porcelain-enameled grill grate cleans with a standard grill brush or removes for washing in an indoor or outdoor sink. The Cuisinart electric grill cooks up juicy steaks, burgers, and fish just like a gas grill thanks to the powerful 1,500-watt, 5,120 BTU burner, which spreads heat quickly and evenly through the 145-square-inch grill grate. The compact design produces a greater watt-to-square-inch ratio, leading to higher temperatures on the grate and better, more uniform cooking for your food. In addition, the grill includes a stainless-steel heat reflector in the lid. This extra layer not only acts as an insulator for trapping heat inside the grill, but actually reflects rising heat inside the grill back onto the top surfaces of your food, reducing cooking times and saving electricity. All of this translates into searing hot temperatures and prefect grill lines on everything you cook. Despite the compact size, the grilling surface is large enough to grill eight burgers, eight stakes, six to 10 chicken breasts, or up to 4 pounds of fish. The electric grill not only shines when it's loaded with food, but also when you're on the move, as the grill is a breeze to transport, set up, and store. The grill includes the thoughtfully designed VersaStand, an easy-to-use, easy-to-set-up grill stand that keeps the grill at a comfortable cooking height. The VersaStand sets up and packs away in seconds, giving you more time to enjoy the event and less time worrying about the hassles of putting your barbecue together. In fact, the grill and stand are so convenient to transport, carry, and set up, you won't think twice about tossing it in the trunk of your car. The VersaStand comes integrated into the base of the grill, with a set of telescoping poles that smoothly collapse for easy storage. When you're ready to grill, simply push the button on each VersaStand leg to release the telescoping legs, and then lift up the grill box. Once the two legs drop into position, you'll have a sturdy grill that stands at an ideal grilling height. No more breaking your back bending over a grill that sits mere inches off the ground. And when you're finished grilling, the stand collapses as easily as it sets up, making it easy to pack up your stuff. The grill also includes a secure front lid lock, which keeps the lid safely closed when you're on the move, and a pronounced carrying handle that lets you tote the 17-pound grill just like a briefcase.\"", "label": 0}

(And have lots of friends!) The George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill has room for over 15 servings of delicious meats, veggies, kabobs, desserts, and more! Plus, its right there in the name and its totally trueyou can use this grill just as easily outdoors as you can indoors. Its made possible by the removable grill stand thats sturdy on the patio and can be removed for countertop grilling. Add in the durable nonstick coating and the patented fat-removing slope, and youve got the power to create large, tasty portions of everyones favorites with simple cleanup, to boot. Whatand wherewill you grill. Tip-control moisture of foods, to some extent, by opening or closing lid vent. Turn lid handle or vent clockwise to open vent for drier cooking. Turn counterclockwise to hold in moisture for moister meats. Light on temperature control probe will cycle on and off as grill thermostat maintains proper temperature. This is normal operation. Note-condensation may collect on inside of lid when cooking Grilling really can't get much easier than this. After assembling the grill (which takes only a few minutes), simply plug it in and allow about 10 minutes to fully preheat the surface while you gather your steaks, kebabs, or whatever's to be grilled. The electric heat has an adjustable range from low (for keeping food warm) to high (for searing steaks). The nonstick grill surface not only means you can use a minimum of added fat, but it also makes cleanup a cinch. The surface has a subtle slope, with channels that draw accumulated fat or other liquids into a tray just below the surface. The high domed and vented lid helps create a circular flow of hot air to ensure even cooking--particularly important for a large roast or whole chicken. The grill can be placed either directly on a tabletop or atop its pedestal. On its own, the grill surface stands about 6 inches high; with the pedestal, it stands about 2-1/2 feet high, not counting the domed lid. The pedestal is plenty sturdy for cooking, but the grill still seems a bit top-heavy, so pay special attention if grilling in a high-traffic area or near kids. Because of the easy electric heat, this grill can be used outdoors or indoors--when using it indoors, though, be prepared for potential spattering, steam, or other side effects of cooking. <I>--Cynthia Nims</I>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Weber 10020 Smokey Joe 14-Inch Portable Grill\" COL feature VAL \"Holds up to five burgers made with a Weber burger press Compact and lightweight for grilling on the go Porcelain-enameled lid and bowl retain heat, and wont rust or peel Dampers allow you to easily control the temperature inside your grill Durable plated steel cooking grate retains heat and is easy to clean.

Year Round Production Odor Free Operation Expandable up to 7 trays\" COL description VAL \"Worm composting is an incredibly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for your garden. Master gardeners agree that compost produced by worms will produce the best results and help your plants thrive. The Worm Factory's unique stackable, multi-tray design makes it the most efficient worm bin composter around. Worms begin eating waste in the lowest tray, and then migrate upward as food sources in that tray are exhausted. By allowing worms to migrate upward, the worms separate themselves from the finished compost that is ready for the garden. Besides the worm castings that are produced through this process, the Worm Factory also produces a second type of compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through your Worm Factory, taking nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer, know as leachate is gathered in the special collection tray of the Worm Factory and can easily be drained from the spigot. Simply add a handful of worms and your organic waste to the bottom tray. The worms will start processing the food. Once the bottom tray is filled add another tray. The worms migrate upward to the newest food source leaving the bottom tray full of nutrient rich compost. As waste is broken down, moisture filters through the system taking nutrient-rich particles with it. You can drain organic liquid fertilizer right from the spigot. It's compact square design gives the Worm Factory the smallest footprint of all worm composters. The Worm Factory's tray stacking system allows it to hold the largest capacity of compost in the smallest amount of space, making it the perfect composter for anyone with space limitations.

Make sure there are a sufficient number of ground rods. See your chargers user manual for recommendations. If in doubt, use at least three ground rods.

This will vary depending on the type of fence, the number of fence wires, how much vegetation is growing around the fence and the climate. Remember, if you extend the length of the fence by adding to the fence or subdividing it with temporary fences, you need to make sure your charger is powerful enough. If you use a more powerful charger, make sure you increase the number of ground rods in the ground system. Avoid using different metals in your electric fence. In damp conditions, when an electric current passes through the differing metals, electrolysis will occur. For example, using stainless steel ground rods and an aluminum leadout wire will cause problems. In a short space of time, the aluminium will disintegrate. If possible, keep the wire joints above the soil to improve airflow and reduce electrolysis. Seal the wire joints with thick paint, epoxy or tar to keep moisture away from the joint area.

Moist soil conducts electricity much better than dry soil. If possible, locate the ground system in a boggy area. In dry weather, wet the area around the ground system to keep the soil moist. Make sure there are a sufficient number of ground rods. See your chargers user manual for recommendations. If in doubt, use at least three ground rods. Use more ground rods if your soil conditions are not ideal. Ground rods should be at least 6'6\" (2 m) long. One long ground rod works better than several short ground rods.\" COL description VAL \"The Patriot PE2 electric fence energizer is a 110-volt AC plug in 0.10 Joule model.

Make sure your electric fence charger meets the requirements of your electric fence, refer to your Patriot installation manual for guidance. This will vary depending on the type of fence, the number of fence wires, how much vegetation is growing around the fence and the climate. Remember, if you extend the length of the fence by adding to the fence or subdividing it with temporary fences, you need to make sure your charger is powerful enough. If you use a more powerful charger, make sure you increase the number of ground rods in the ground system. Avoid using different metals in your electric fence. In damp conditions, when an electric current passes through the differing metals, electrolysis will occur. For example, using stainless steel ground rods and an aluminum leadout wire will cause problems. In a short space of time, the aluminium will disintegrate. If possible, keep the wire joints above the soil to improve airflow and reduce electrolysis. Seal the wire joints with thick paint, epoxy or tar to keep moisture away from the joint area. Use identical metals in your electric fence will avoid problems with electrolysis altogether.\"", "label": 0}

Plus, its right there in the name and its totally trueyou can use this grill just as easily outdoors as you can indoors. Its made possible by the removable grill stand thats sturdy on the patio and can be removed for countertop grilling. Add in the durable nonstick coating and the patented fat-removing slope, and youve got the power to create large, tasty portions of everyones favorites with simple cleanup, to boot. Whatand wherewill you grill. Tip-control moisture of foods, to some extent, by opening or closing lid vent. Turn lid handle or vent clockwise to open vent for drier cooking. Turn counterclockwise to hold in moisture for moister meats. Light on temperature control probe will cycle on and off as grill thermostat maintains proper temperature. This is normal operation. Note-condensation may collect on inside of lid when cooking Grilling really can't get much easier than this. After assembling the grill (which takes only a few minutes), simply plug it in and allow about 10 minutes to fully preheat the surface while you gather your steaks, kebabs, or whatever's to be grilled. The electric heat has an adjustable range from low (for keeping food warm) to high (for searing steaks). The nonstick grill surface not only means you can use a minimum of added fat, but it also makes cleanup a cinch. The surface has a subtle slope, with channels that draw accumulated fat or other liquids into a tray just below the surface. The high domed and vented lid helps create a circular flow of hot air to ensure even cooking--particularly important for a large roast or whole chicken. The grill can be placed either directly on a tabletop or atop its pedestal. On its own, the grill surface stands about 6 inches high; with the pedestal, it stands about 2-1/2 feet high, not counting the domed lid. The pedestal is plenty sturdy for cooking, but the grill still seems a bit top-heavy, so pay special attention if grilling in a high-traffic area or near kids. Because of the easy electric heat, this grill can be used outdoors or indoors--when using it indoors, though, be prepared for potential spattering, steam, or other side effects of cooking. <I>--Cynthia Nims</I>\"", "label": 0}

This basic-but-beautiful model has two stainless-steel burners and practical features like stainless-steel side tables that fold down when you aren't using them. The grill's porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates combine the ease of porcelain enamel with the superior heat retention of cast iron. The grates require no seasoning and are easy to clean. Providing plenty of space to grill up all those summertime--or year round--favorites, the unit offers a 26,500-BTU-per-hour input, and its total capacity consists of 450 square inches of cooking space (a 360-square-inch primary cooking area and a 90-square-inch warming rack). The grill also provides porcelain-enameled Flavorizer bars, a center-mounted thermometer, an enclosed cart, and a stainless-steel shroud that can withstand the elements for durability from one year to the next. Other highlights include six tool hooks, two heavy-duty front-locking casters, and two heavy-duty back swivel casters. Requiring a 20-pound LP tank (not included) to operate, the gas grill's fuel gauge lets you know exactly where you stand on fuel at all times (LP only). Notice how sturdy the shroud feels as it opens smoothly on its hinges? See how the burners roar to life on the very first try? Delighted by how simple it is to achieve a mouthwatering meal every time? It's no accident. Weber spends countless hours perfecting the grilling systems on its gas grills, assuring easy assembly, an evenly heated cooking surface, and precision controls so you can tone things down or up to the perfect heat level for direct or indirect cooking. The cookbox houses the components of the cooking system: cooking grates, burner tubes, Favorizer Bars, and the grease management system. Made of cast aluminum, Weber's gas-grill cookboxes are durable, efficient, require minimal care and maintenance, and can withstand the heat needed to grill at any temperature. In addition, the shape of the cookbox, when combined with the shroud, allows for the proper circulation of heat around food for even cooking whether you're using direct or indirect heat. Weber gas-grill cooking grates come in three exceptional materials: porcelain-enameled steel, stainless steel, and porcelain-enameled cast iron. Each type retains heat evenly and sears food beautifully. Porcelain-enameled steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean. Stainless steel rod cooking grates make lovely sear marks, hold heat very well, and clean up with ease. Porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates combine the ease of porcelain-enameled with the superior heat retention of cast iron--no need to season and easy to clean. Weber's burners are made of high-grade stainless steel, which will stand up to the small amounts of water found in liquid propane and natural gas. The burner tubes are made of a singular piece of steel with no welds, making them stronger and more resistant to rust and burn-through. And while they are protected from grease drippings and food by the Flavorizer bars, Weber cart gas grill burner tubes can be cleaned easily by gently brushing with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush. Controls for each burner give you the ability to grill by the direct or indirect method. Even more, the burners are spaced to provide heat across the entire cooking grate, and the burner valves have infinite control settings, so you can fine-tune the heat levels. The innovative Flavorizer bar system, originally created by Weber, is designed perfectly to perform a variety of functions on the Spirit , Genesis, and Summit gas grills. Angled just right, the Flavorizer bars catch drippings that smoke and sizzle, adding flavor to your food. Any drippings not vaporized by the Flavorizer bars follow the slope of their unique angle and are funneled away from the burner tubes, down into the grease management system. Not only does this help prevent flare-ups inside your grill, but it also protects the burner tubes from becoming clogged. Made of either porcelain enamel or stainless steel, Flavorizer bars are durable, long lasting, and easy to care for. Periodically brushing them clean with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush will help keep Flavorizer bars performing at their best. When juices drip off the meat, they funnel down to the Flavorizer bars, and then what doesn't vaporize into wonderful smoke goes down into the grease management system. The grease management system consists of an angled grease tray and catch pan. The grease tray rests beneath the cookbox a safe distance from the burner tubes to prevent the grease from catching fire. Grease is channeled down the grease tray and into the catch pan. Both the grease tray and catch pan are easy to clean. The tray easily slides out of the cabinet for cleaning, and when the catch pan starts to fill, simply remove the disposable drip pan, toss it in the trash, and replace it with an empty pan. A fuel gauge lets you know exactly where you stand on fuel at all times. When George Stephen created the first Weber grill, he wanted to be able to bring his family together for a good meal. He insisted on a product that would exceed customers' expectations.
