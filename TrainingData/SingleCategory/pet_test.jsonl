This Mega Ray Pet Care Lighting original design provides the necessary UVB, UVA and heat for your UVB-dependent basking reptiles. More UVB - But Safer Our Mega-Ray SB 100 watt Narrow Flood Lamp produces more UVB than other true Mercury Vapor Floods, yet is safer for owners! Our design directs the majority of the UVB from the face of the bulb, rather than diffuse it across a 180 angle. Longer Useful Life Using cutting edge technology coupled with five years of dedicated research and testing, we have conquered and significantly reduced the huge decay rates so common in other Mercury Vapor lamps. While other bulbs decay as much as 80%, our newly designed SB bulbs decay less than 30% over the life of the bulb. This is unseen in the industry. Specifications Mega-Ray SB 100-watt narrow-flood is a 100-watt SB Par-38 True Frosted Flood Lamp. A true flood lamp, it will disperse usable UVB in a 30\" circumference at a 20\" distance. MINIMUM distance setting of 12\" will produce approximately 150-200 microwatts per square centimeter (uW/cm2) of UVB and 900-1200uW/cm2 of UVA. MAXIMUM distance setting of 20\" will produce 50-75 microwatts per square centimeter (uW/cm2) of UVB. (Distance is measured from lamp face to basking spot or reptile for optimum UVB and heat.) Most people with UVB meters are getting 18+ months use out of our SB bulbs. Warning: Heat This 100-watt self-ballasted bulb also produces heat. It is very important that you monitor the heat at the basking area and adjust the fixture-to-basking area distance accordingly to maintain a proper heat gradient. ALWAYS triple check the temperature at the basking spot - never risk burning your reptile.\"", "label": 0}

Fish excreta, debris, phosphate, and ammonia disturbs the natural ecosystem of the water tank. If the natural marimo moss ball is present in the water tank, they suck the toxic material. These balls thus, help in creating a natural and thriving atmosphere for the aquatic species. PREVENTS EXCESSIVE ALGAE GROWTH --- Both algae and marimo moss balls compete for the same nutrients for growth. Since, they absorb most of the nitrates, ammonia, and phosphates, they leave a scant room for algae to thrive. Consequently, the 4 LUFFY Marimo Moss Balls prevent unwanted algae from growing back. REAL MARIMOS ARE NOT ALWAYS SPHERICAL & MIGHT HAVE SOME BROWN SPOTS ON THEM --- As you buy LUFFY Marimo Moss Balls, you should be able to differentiate between a real and a fake marimo. The 100% natural marimo will not always be spherical in shape or lush green in color. It is perfectly ok to have some brown spots. However, if you do find sparkling green and perfectly spherical marimos, there are high chances that they are unnatural and pesticide rich marimos. ECO-FRIENDLY, ADDS TO THE AESTHETIC BEAUTY & ARE LOW MAINTENANCE --- LUFFY prohibits the usage of dye that imparts artificial green color to the moss balls. Since it distributes eco-friendly, natural marimo moss balls, expect to receive regular/irregular shaped moss balls which are not always in deep green color. Undoubtedly, the marimo moss balls add to the aesthetic beauty of the aquarium and are low maintenance. They simply require some light and freshwater. SNAIL-PROOF AND LOVED BY SHRIMPS --- Some snails love to feed on live plants, but when it comes to the LUFFY marimo moss balls, they nibble or eat food off it just like a shrimp. Shrimps, on the other hand, gorge on the green stuff and munch on any particle they like. We recommend keeping the marimo moss balls away from fishes such as Koi or goldfish as its a tasty snack for them. Its completely safe for them, but you dont want your one pet to eat your plant pet. <span>         Save 80% on 1 <a href=\"/gp/product/B00OLPMPYY?ie=UTF8&m=A131SO7MHPCPON\">Luffy Plump your marimo with Fertilizer</a> For every 1 any marimo item you purchase offered by LUFFY PETS COLLECTION.

If your pet is out of its cage during the day to play and exercise, the cage can be smaller to accommodate just a sleeping place, food and water. <BR><BR><B>Why we need a sleeping hut</B><BR>A nestbox or sleeping hut is often appreciated although not always absolutely necessary. Many small animals are nocturnal. That means they like to sleep during the day and run around at night. A hut can help your pet feel more comfortable during the sunlight hours while it is sleeping. <BR><BR><B>What kind of decors should I get</B><BR>Scampering around is a favorite activity for most small animals, especially hamsters and mice. An exercise wheel or a variation of the wheel, a spinning disc, is a great choice for smaller pets. Another variation of the exercise wheel is an exercise ball. Your pet can climb into the ball and roll around the floor or on specially made tracks. Your pet can overexert itself; so don't keep it in the ball for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time. Some small animals, such as ferrets, sugar gliders and rats like to climb on limbs. Climbing branches, bird perches and bird swings work well. They may get chewed up, but that's part of your pet's play, too! <BR><BR><B>Others caring tips</B><BR>Check it's cage for chewed or damaged areas. Remove any old foods and check the toys to be sure they are still working and in good condition.

Flavored with real liver, your pet will love them.

The pests simply stay away from your pet because of the odor (undetected by humans) that your pets skin gives off. With Flea Away your dog or cat's skin gives off a natural smell caused by the special safe mixture of vitamins. If your dog or cat has an allergic reaction to flea bites, then Flea Away is the way to go. The fleas, ticks and mosquitoes are naturally repelled before biting your pet. Dosage: Cats: 1 chewable tablet 1 time daily. Dogs: Up to 50 pounds - 1 tablet 1 time daily, 51 to 100 pounds - 2 tablets 1 time daily, 101 to 150 pounds - 3 tablets 1 time daily.

Natural. Beautiful.</div> <div class=\"description\"> The EcoQube C is a beautiful, low maintenance aquarium that uses aquaponics to filter water. This means less hassle for you, and less stress for any fish you wish to keep. Bring your surroundings into your home, without the mess of course. Each EcoQube comes equipped with fully customisable LED lights, and special presets. Fix your diurnal rhythm and give your body clock a boost, and bring a little bit of nature into your space while you're at it. Using aquaponics, the EcoCube C silently filters the water with the plant you've grown, making sure that you never have to change your filter again. The clear acrylic panels of the EcoQube C make its contents crystal-clear from the outside, making it the perfect centrepiece for your space. Easy to setup, easy to maintain. It's the perfect gift for a loved one, and would make any nature-lover happy no matter their lifestyle or how green their fingers are. We created the EcoQube, a desktop ecosystem that uses basil to filter water, to showcase firsthand the practical solution and beauty of aquaponics. We want to start a movement to use the same concept of sustainable agriculture to feed the world! We know that we cant solve the many problems on our planet with an aquarium, no matter how beautiful it is, but we hope to connect people to our environment and influence the way they perceive the larger issues in our world today. To reconnect people with our environment. We see that our world is facing some serious issues in terms of food and water shortages, and we want to be a part of the change for the better. We're a team of aquarium enthusiasts and have been our entire lives. While doing research at the largest aquaponics farm in the nation, we learned we could use basil to filter the fish waste. With the same method, aquaponics uses 90% less water grows food 2x as fast in 1/2 the space with no pesticides or fertilizers. We spent years to perfectly implement aquaponics into an aquarium creating the ecoqube, the lowest maintenance aquarium ever. The Aquaponics system makes owning a fish easier than a conventional fish tank. The fish's waste is used by the basil plant to grow and elminates the need for a water change. A few fish, some shrimp and a snail or two will give you the perfect balance for a low maintenance ecosystem. Through creating the EcoQube, we've been able to introduce the concept of sustainability to hundreds of thousands of people and helped nearly 10,000 people bring nature into their homes. Now we have a team dedicated to helping all our customers succeed with creating their very own window to nature with the EcoQube\"", "label": 1}

This behavior is your pet dosing themselves with soil based organisms (probiotics). Pet Flora is a SBO, a probiotic containing healthy bacteria and yeast, believed to improve health. It is unique due to it being cultivated in earth instead of dairy. Most probiotics are cultivated in dairy and may actually be less effective and cause more problems for animals suffering from lactose-intolerance. Vitality Science takes the Soil Based Probiotics and then adds Humic and Fulvic acids, extracted from ancient plant deposits. What are probiotics? Friendly bacteria and yeast. The digestive system is home to more than 500 different types of bacteria. They help keep the intestines healthy and assist in digesting food. They are also believed to help the immune system. Researchers believe that some digestive disorders happen when the balance of friendly bacteria in the intestines becomes disturbed. Everyday stresses can contribute to an imbalance of bacteria, including; travel, boarding, separation anxiety, sickness, eating different foods and objects or processed food. A disturbance is especially apparent after an infection or after taking antibiotics. Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria that causes infections, unfortunately they also kill the friendly bacteria; Pet Flora introduces friendly bacteria. *The best part about Vitality Science is that we have excellent customer support. Please contact our pet health experts for any questions about our products (how to use, dosages, updates) we love to hear from you!\"", "label": 1}

However, if your horse is turned out in a field without a run in shed or shelter during prolonged rain or heavy downpours, your horse may still get wet, especially in the neck and tail areas.

When a blanket is too heavy, the heat and moisture cannot be wicked away fast enough, causing your horse to sweat. The temperature and the length of your horse's coat will determine what weight of blanket you should use. For this reason, most people who choose to blanket horses have several articles of horse clothing that offer varying levels of warmth.

It is not necessary to add supplemental vitamins or minerals. Food consumption can vary during gestation. Feed the amount needed to maintain ideal body condition in the pregnant female. After kittens are born, feed the nursing female all she wants to eat. Food intake can be 2(en)3 times greater by the fourth week of lactation as it was prior to when the female was bred. Food intake can be increased by feeding Pro Plan moistened with water and feeding twice daily. Kitten Feeding: Kittens generally nibble solid foods at 3(en)4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Pro Plan available to these kittens at all times. After weaning, at 6(en)8 weeks of age, kittens will normally eat dry or moistened food at will. If water is added, use no more than one part warm (not hot) liquid to three parts Pro Plan, changing frequently to ensure freshness. As kittens near adulthood, their calorie needs may decrease. Continue to adjust the amount you feed to maintain your kitten in ideal body condition and avoid excess weight gain. Making the Switch to Pro Plan: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Pro Plan can make in your kitten, please allow 7(en)10 days to ease the transition from your kitten's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Pro Plan until you're feeding Pro Plan exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Store in a cool, dry place.

Not to be used with dimmers or rheostats.\" COL description VAL \"This lamp is our top-of-the-range 160 watt SB Par-38 Narrow Flood Lamp which has been shown in tests to produce similar amounts of UVB to natural sunlight! - along with adequate heat to create a basking spot at the recommended distances, in many circumstances. This ReptileUV Mega Ray original design provides the necessary UVB, UVA and heat for your UVB-dependent basking reptiles. Using cutting edge technology coupled with five years of dedicated research and testing, we have conquered and significantly reduced the huge decay rates so common in other Mercury Vapor lamps. While other bulbs decay as much as 80%, our newly designed SB bulbs decay less than 30% over the life of the bulb. This is unseen in the industry. Our ReptileUV original design Mega Ray SB 160 watt Narrow Flood Lamp produces more UVB than other true Mercury Vapor Floods, yet is safer for owners! Our design directs the majority of the UVB from the face of the bulb, rather than diffuse it across a 180 angle. Mega-Ray SB 160-watt narrow-flood is a 160-watt SB Par-38 True Frosted Flood Lamp. A true flood lamp, it will disperse usable UVB in a 30\" circumference at a 20\" distance. MINIMUM distance setting of 18\" will produce approximately a UVI reading of 5-7 and 900-1200uW/cm2 of UVA. MAXIMUM distance setting of 24\" will produce about a 3 UVI reading (Distance is measured from lamp face to basking spot or reptile for optimum UVB and heat.) Most people with UVB or UVI meters are getting 18+ months use out of our SB bulbs. This 160-watt self-ballasted bulb also produces heat. It is very important that you monitor the heat at the basking area and adjust the fixture-to-basking area distance accordingly to maintain a proper heat gradient. ALWAYS *triple* check the temperature at the basking spot - never risk burning your reptile.\"", "label": 0}

Premium chews with the irresistible combination of real chicken breast jerky. Wrapped in the highest quality smoked pork rawhide. Helps promote healthy teeth by preventingtartar build-up. Guaranteed Analysis:80%, Crude Fat (Min)  In the 1990's, the Dingo brand started with a man named Les and his dog, Dingo. Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone. Dingo comes in different shapes, flavors and functional forms:   \"", "label": 1}

L-Theanine (Suntheanine) is popular among those who seek natural-remedies and diets as a means to a healthy lifestyle. Suntheanine is the purest form of L-Theanine, produced via a patented fermentation process that mimics the natural process in green tea leaves. L-Theanine has only recently become recognized in the west for its ability to calm without causing drowsiness and to reduce general stress, irritability, and anxiety. Studies have indicated that L-Theanines effects are just as promising in dogs and cats. L-Theanine is an amino acid which increases GABA levels in the brain. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid, or GABA, is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian central nervous systems, responsible for regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. L-Theanine also increases the levels of dopamine, the brains reward chemical, responsible for many positive feelings. The effects of L-Theanine are not instant, so chewable supplements containing it should ideally be given 30 to 40 minutes prior to the desired effect taking place. L-Theanine will then cross the blood-brain barrier to directly stimulate the production of alpha brain waves, creating a state of relaxation, and will stimulate the formation of GABA and Dopamine. L-Theanine differs from anti-stress herbs such as valerian root and kava kava in that it doesnt cause drowsiness. In fact, studies have demonstrated L-Theanine to promote mental clarity and focus and to enhance learning and memory, making it an excellent aid for training sessions. It will reduce nervous tension and many of the negative and destructive behavioral patters associated with anxiety in dogs and cats. It can be taken without food and at any time.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"VetriScience Laboratories Composure, Calming Support for Dogs\" COL feature VAL \"Composure calming formula includes colostrum, l-theanine and thiamine; all recognized ingredients to support calmer behavior and relaxation.

Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone. Dingo comes in different shapes, flavors and functional forms:\"", "label": 1}

If your pet relieves himself somewhere other than the designated spot where the pad is placed, bring him back to the correct spot immediately. Keep in mind that your pet will have to relive himself shortly after a meal and will need to eliminate more frequently during the summer when his water intake is higher. The minute your dog begins to relieve himself on the pad, be sure to use cures like go potty. You should use this cue every time that your dog relives himself on the pad so that he associates the phrase with the action of elimination. Every time that your pet used the pad successfully, make sure that you give him a treat and lots of praise. Treating helps your dog to understand that he is doing what you want him to do. Always remember to dispose of soiled pads and replace them as needed. When your pet begins to relieve himself on the pads, on consistent basic, it is time to begin moving the pad closer to the door. Keep moving the pads closer to the door until they are actually outside. At this time, the training process will be complete.\"", "label": 0}

This ReptileUV Mega Ray original design provides the necessary UVB, UVA and heat for your UVB-dependent basking reptiles. Using cutting edge technology coupled with five years of dedicated research and testing, we have conquered and significantly reduced the huge decay rates so common in other Mercury Vapor lamps. While other bulbs decay as much as 80%, our newly designed SB bulbs decay less than 30% over the life of the bulb. This is unseen in the industry. Our ReptileUV original design Mega Ray SB 160 watt Narrow Flood Lamp produces more UVB than other true Mercury Vapor Floods, yet is safer for owners! Our design directs the majority of the UVB from the face of the bulb, rather than diffuse it across a 180 angle. Mega-Ray SB 160-watt narrow-flood is a 160-watt SB Par-38 True Frosted Flood Lamp. A true flood lamp, it will disperse usable UVB in a 30\" circumference at a 20\" distance. MINIMUM distance setting of 18\" will produce approximately a UVI reading of 5-7 and 900-1200uW/cm2 of UVA. MAXIMUM distance setting of 24\" will produce about a 3 UVI reading (Distance is measured from lamp face to basking spot or reptile for optimum UVB and heat.) Most people with UVB or UVI meters are getting 18+ months use out of our SB bulbs. This 160-watt self-ballasted bulb also produces heat. It is very important that you monitor the heat at the basking area and adjust the fixture-to-basking area distance accordingly to maintain a proper heat gradient.

It is an excellent carpet flea and tick spray also.<br><br> <b>How it Works:</b> When fleas, ticks, and other insects are exposed to Cedar Bug-Free Flea and Tick Spray, the aroma of the Cedar Oil overwhelms their breathing system and triggers a suicide response - their spiracles (breathing pores) close and cannot open again. This formulation also dissolves the insect eggs and larvae, eliminating the next generation, while the aroma of Cedar disrupts their pheromone signals and creates a barrier of entry to newly arriving pests. Cedar Bug-Free Flea and Tick Spray is more effective than other natural insecticides and is longer lasting.<br><br> <b>How to Use It:</b> Apply a light misting of Cedar Bug-Free Flea and Tick Spray directly to your cat's coat or onto your hand or a cloth and rub it in around the ears, tail, legs and stomach areas to kill fleas and ticks and for long lasting protection from biting insects. Use it before taking your pet for a walk as a repellent to get rid of fleas and ticks who want to hitch a ride. For ear mites, gently apply inside the ears with a cotton swab twice a day.<br><br> Getting rid of fleas, ticks and mites often requires you and your pet to come in direct contact with poisonous chemicals that are unsafe and can be dangerous. The prevention and extermination process is easier and safer when our Natural pet products are used instead of chemicals that are dangerous and less effective.\"", "label": 0}

Fish excreta, debris, phosphate, and ammonia disturbs the natural ecosystem of the water tank. If the natural marimo moss ball is present in the water tank, they suck the toxic material. These balls thus, help in creating a natural and thriving atmosphere for the aquatic species. PREVENTS EXCESSIVE ALGAE GROWTH --- Both algae and marimo moss balls compete for the same nutrients for growth. Since, they absorb most of the nitrates, ammonia, and phosphates, they leave a scant room for algae to thrive. Consequently, the 4 LUFFY Marimo Moss Balls prevent unwanted algae from growing back. REAL MARIMOS ARE NOT ALWAYS SPHERICAL & MIGHT HAVE SOME BROWN SPOTS ON THEM --- As you buy LUFFY Marimo Moss Balls, you should be able to differentiate between a real and a fake marimo. The 100% natural marimo will not always be spherical in shape or lush green in color. It is perfectly ok to have some brown spots. However, if you do find sparkling green and perfectly spherical marimos, there are high chances that they are unnatural and pesticide rich marimos. ECO-FRIENDLY, ADDS TO THE AESTHETIC BEAUTY & ARE LOW MAINTENANCE --- LUFFY prohibits the usage of dye that imparts artificial green color to the moss balls. Since it distributes eco-friendly, natural marimo moss balls, expect to receive regular/irregular shaped moss balls which are not always in deep green color. Undoubtedly, the marimo moss balls add to the aesthetic beauty of the aquarium and are low maintenance. They simply require some light and freshwater. SNAIL-PROOF AND LOVED BY SHRIMPS --- Some snails love to feed on live plants, but when it comes to the LUFFY marimo moss balls, they nibble or eat food off it just like a shrimp. Shrimps, on the other hand, gorge on the green stuff and munch on any particle they like. We recommend keeping the marimo moss balls away from fishes such as Koi or goldfish as its a tasty snack for them. Its completely safe for them, but you dont want your one pet to eat your plant pet. <span>         Save 80% on 1 <a href=\"/gp/product/B00OLPMPYY?ie=UTF8&m=A131SO7MHPCPON\">Luffy Plump your marimo with Fertilizer</a> For every 1 any marimo item you purchase offered by LUFFY PETS COLLECTION.

Its better for the environment  at Terra Pet Naturals we use only natural, plant-based ingredients. We also use minimal packaging and recyclable materials. Frequently Asked Questions: Q: How Long Will This product last for? A: It depends on the dogs size, the area where you live, and how frequently your dog might be exposed to ticks and fleas. Each 8 oz. bottle of spray contains approximately 900 single sprays, meaning that it if you used 30 single sprays on your dog two times a week, a single bottle of spray would last approximately four months. Q: My dog has sensitive skin, are these products safe? A: The ingredients used in our products are both gentle and safe. In fact, apple cider vinegar is known to help improve skin conditions! As with all naturals products, it is possible (although unlikely) that your dog might be allergic to an ingredient in our spray. If irritation or swelling occurs, discontinue use and contact a veterinarian. Q: Ive been using your product, but I just found a tick on my dog. Does that mean the product isnt working? A: Although our tick and flea repellents are highly effective and repel the vast majority of ticks, it is possible that once-in-awhile, a tick might still try to attach itself to your dog. If you find this is the case, try applying more spray on your dog, focusing on areas where ticks like to attach (i.e. head, ears). Q: Ive seen other natural tick and flea products on the market. How is yours different? A: Terra Pet Naturals uses a custom blend of 11 different essential oils along with apple cider vinegar, providing maximum protection against ticks and fleas. We use all-natural ingredients and strive to be eco-friendly in all our practices.\"", "label": 1}

These playful additions come in small and large sizes as well as a variety of colors to fully complete your aquarium. GloFish offers an assortment of brightly colored gravel that add a finishing touch to your GloFish Aquarium. GloFish fluorescent fish add brilliant color to any home, office, or classroom aquarium. These fun fish have the unique ability to absorb light and then re-emit it, creating the perception that they are glowing. GloFish were originally bred to help scientists in detecting environmental pollutants. By adding a naturally derived fluorescence gene to the fish, scientists hoped to quickly and easily determine when a waterway was contaminated. Scientists soon realized the publics interest in sharing the benefits of this research and GloFish were officially brought into the marketplace. GloFish acquire their fluorescent color via a fluorescent protein gene that they inherit from their parents and pass on to their offspring through traditional breeding. Because of this, each line of GloFish originates from a single fish. For example, all Starfish Red Danios are descended from a single red fluorescent zebrafish. GloFish are available in 3 species: GloFish Danio, GloFish Barb, and GloFish Tetra. Aside from their brighter disposition, each species is identical to their non-fluorescent counterparts. This includes everything from general care and temperature preferences, to growth and nutritional needs. GloFish come in six stunning fluorescent colors including Starfire Red, Sunburst Orange, Electric Green, Cosmic Blue, Galactic Purple, and Moonrise Pink. GloFish understands that the enormous potential of genetic technology carries with it an important responsibility. To help ensure the appropriate use of this technology, GloFish commits to the following guiding ethical principles: To keep your GloFish vibrant, healthy, and thriving, it is important to provide quality nutrition and optimal water conditions. For this reason, GloFish has created a line of products specifically formulated to help GloFish thrive.

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water.

The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants.

But for us, our name symbolizes the incredible bond between a human and a pet. That love and allegiance is a two way street with purrs and wags in between. Pets give us undying devotion, and we give pets the best food, the best love, and the best goofy Halloween costumes. Were all about that bond, and we love being a part of it.

I make each jacket using quality fabrics. It fastens securely around the neck and chest with long strips of velcro. All jackets are reversible with black cotton. My jackets are extremely durable, triple sewn for strength, hard wearing and machine washable. They are easy and quick to put on and adjust to your cat.
