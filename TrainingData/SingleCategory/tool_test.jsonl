For over 75 years InSinkErator has been known for building the world's best food waste disposers. Today, the Evolution Series disposers represent the highest standard in performance. Simply put, they are the best grinding, quietest line of disposers. InSinkErator food waste disposers are the only disposers that are proudly made in the U.S.A. of the finest quality materials. InSinkErator has grown into the largest food waste disposer manufacturer and best-selling garbage disposer brand in the world. The Evolution Essential features sound reducing technology that ensures less noise than a standard disposer. This state-of-the-art technology makes it possible to hold a conversation with normal voices in the same room as the disposer. This technology includes superior insulation around the motor, an anti-vibration sink mount, and an anti-vibration tailpipe to prevent sound transmission from vibrations. The sink baffle also helps prevent sound from escaping the throat of the disposer. The Evolution Essential disposer features MultiGrind technology, which allows you to grind almost any food waste reducing the chance of clogs and jams. This disposer features a two-stage grind technology that includes a GrindShear Ring and Tri-Action Lug system that makes tough to grind foods a thing of the past as food waste is virtually liquefied to safely flow into your sewage system. InSinkErator brand disposers are the easiest to install. That's because all InSinkErator garbage disposal models feature our popular stainless steel Quick Lock sink mount. Just \"twist off\" the old disposer and \"twist on\" the new one. What's more, with Quick Lock, you can replace any InSinkErator branded garbage disposal including Badger garbage disposals. The Evolution Compact disposer featuring MultiGrind technology, allows you to grind tough to grind foods such as: celery, apple cores, potato peels, small bones, and fruit pits. Avoid grinding large amounts of these foods at once, and remember to use cold water while operating your disposer. Food waste disposers don't just offer practical convenience; they provide an environmentally sound answer to the growing problem of food waste. Food waste disposers can provide an environmentally responsible alternative to transporting food waste to landfills. And they can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At capable wastewater treatment plants, food waste can be recycled to produce renewable energy.

The unique combination of digital Pointfinder and 360-degree tilt sensor allows measurements which are not possible with conventional distance meters. In addition, with Bluetooth Smart 4.0 and attractive free apps, you are prepared for the future. Using the Pointfinder display and 4x zoom, the E7500i takes measurements with perfect accuracy and in unfavorable light conditions. This is a decisive advantage when working outside in sunny weather. Even if the red laser point is no longer visible to the naked eye, the target can be seen exactly in the crosshairs on the display. Equipped with a 360-degree tilt sensor, its also possible to measure heights, elevation changes, and true horizontal distances even over obstructions. Using the Pointfinder and the tilt together, additional indirect height measurements are possible where no reflective target point is available (e.g., when determining the height of a tree, tower, utility structures, buildings, etc.). These types of objects cannot be measured using conventional laser distance meters. With a full color display and easy navigation from the keypad, the E7500i provides the simplest possible operation of complex measuring functions. For daily use items, your favorite functions can be assigned to a pair of selection keys that give you quick access with a single button press. If you need help with the function, press the help key and it will show you how to perform the measurement. The housing and keypad are fully sealed against water and dust to IP65 standards and drop tested to 1 meter. Hot, cold, wet, or dry, the laser distance meter can be used in all weather conditions When accuracy really counts and conditions are less than perfect, the E7500i still performs and is tested to meet the ISO 16331-1 standard. This standard sets benchmarks for range and accuracy of laser distance meters depending on light conditions and reflectivity of the measuring target. Only Leica Geosystems laser measurement tools meet these tough standards. Our instruments do not just perform under perfect laboratory conditions, but above all, under every kind working conditions encountered on construction sites. Continuous development and technology innovation means the Leica DISTO series provides comprehensive functionality. Equipped with the latest innovations, these tools are flexible and versatile across a wide range of applications. When in use, the DISTO delivers the highest accuracy and reliability. Not every surface is perfect, and sometimes you need to get into tight corners or measure from an edge. The flip out end piece accounts for edges, corners, tight spaces, and automatically recognizes the correct reference point when used. Integrated tilt sensors combined with laser distance allows indirect measurements of distance and height from remote locations safely without the expense of ladders or lifts. For outdoor measurement, the full color digital Pointfinder display with 4x zoom makes targeting easy in bright sunlight or over long distances.\"", "label": 0}

These are ideal for someone who is remodeling a kitchen or wants to add a disposer, but isn't set up with a pre-existing wall switch. This model has a high RPM and high torque, to grind food finer and faster. Since select GE Disposal disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposall disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposall offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposall has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs.

The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system. Even more, the food-waste disposal features sound-reduction technology that helps ensure quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen. To operate, remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, and scrape in the food waste. Insert the stopper to start the disposal. One of the two small slots in the stopper base must line up with the switch plunger inside the neck of the disposal. Push down firmly to start, and voila--the disposal takes care of the rest. Be sure to run the disposal run for 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain. To shut the disposal off, simply lift the stopper. The stopper can also be used to fill the sink with water--just insert so that the largest slot lines up with the switch plunger. Then push the stopper down to seal the sink without starting the disposal. Line up the medium-sized slot to allow water to drain, but without allowing tableware and other items to drop down into the disposal. The food-waste disposal measures 8-1/2 inches in diameter by 16-5/8 inches high.

The Leak Alert has a low battery warning for optimum performance. Just like your smoke detector, remember to check and replace your Leak Alert batteries every year.\"", "label": 0}

The Stockbridge can be installed with or without the light. One of the biggest complaints with ceiling fans is having to clean dusty fan blades and the unsightliness of having extremely dusty blades in an otherwise clean home. After years of research, Hunger has formulated a blade coating that helps to repel dust build up through a breakthrough nanotechnology. Fan blades with Hunter's Dust Armor blade coating have a layer of nano particles that repel small moisture molecules. Dust particles gather to water molecules and when the density of the dust/water particles is low enough, light air currents blow the combined particle away from the surface. <div class=\"imageCaption\">*For comparison, 49- to 60-inch ceiling fans have airflow efficiencies ranging from approximately 51 to 176 cubic feet per minute per watt at high speed.</div> The Hunter Fan company traces its origins back to 1886, when John Hunter and son James C. Hunter created the first water-driven ceiling fan in upstate New York. Today, the company continues to combine 19th century craftsmanship with innovative design and technology to create air-movement products of unmatched quality, style, and whisper-quiet performance.

Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposall has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs. All our models operate quietly and some even offer sound reduction technology. The sound reduction package includes a fully insulated sound shell, so our disposers can handle your toughest challenges while minimizing noise. Did you know that Americans throw away nearly 25 percent of all food prepared? And decomposing waste in landfills is one of the largest producers of methane gas, which is the main contributor of global warming? It's true. <div class=\"aplus\"> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width:175px\"> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/ge/B005FNVQIW-main.jpg\" title=\"GFC325V\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/ge/B005FNVQIW-main_t.jpg\" width=\"119\" height=\"300\" alt=\"GFC325V\" /></a> <div class=\"imageCaption\">Large-capacity continuous-feed food-waste disposal with 1/3-horsepower motor. <br><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/ge/B005FNVQIW-main.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">view larger</a></div> </div> <h4>1/3-Horsepower Continuous-Feed Food-Waste Disposal </h4> <h5>Helps Take Care of the Dirty Work</h5> Send food waste down the drain once and for all with this large-capacity GFC325V garbage disposal by GE. The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system. Even more, the food-waste disposal features an advanced insulation package that helps ensure super-quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen. Thoughtfully constructed, the food-waste disposal system also provides a two-level precutter, an on/off wall-switch with a sink stopper, a manual-reset overload protector, and a splashguard, as well as stainless-steel, jam-resistant, dual swivel impellers. Other highlights include cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material, a stainless-steel sink flange, and a galvanized-steel turntable. To operate, simply remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, flip the switch to ON, and scrape in the food waste. The continuous-feed disposal takes care of the rest. Before turning the disposal off, let the water and the disposal run for about 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain. The disposal measures 5.19 inches deep by 5.5 inches wide by 12.69 inches high, and detailed installation instructions come included. <small>* Based on RPM testing of cleared GE and competitive models</small>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Garbage Disposer Air Switch Kit for Insinkerator Evolution\" COL feature VAL \"This kit is replaced with your old Garbage Disposal with air switch, if your old one doesn't have the air switch (just have the power switch), this kit will not fit for With self-lock, press the switch, it open, press the swith again, it lock\" COL description VAL \"pecifications: Thread Diameter :32mm Air Hose Length: 100CM Button diameter:46mm Air Hose Diameter:3mm Scope of application: 16A 250V function:With self-lock, press the switch, it open, press the swith again, it lock.

As electronic equipment becomes smaller, the circuits and components become more delicate and easily damaged. Fuses are the preferred method of protection due to their accuracy, small size and reliability. Fuses are available in a wide variety of amp ratings to provide precise protection. Generally, two sizes of user-replaceable fuses are found: the 1/4 x 11/4 and 5 x 20Mm. Each is available in a variety of volt and amp ratings. There are two basic types of fuses available for appliances and consumer electronics: fast-acting or time-delay. Any Replacement fuse must match the one Its replacing. In general, fast-acting fuses are a single strand of wire or strip of metal. Time-delay fuses usually have a coiled wire, a thick element wrapped in wire, or a spring. Most electronic fuses will have the voltage and amp rating stamped on the end cap. The type of fuse can generally be visually identified. Also, owners manuals will have the correct Replacement fuse generically identified. For example: use a 2 amp, time-delay, 250 volt fuse. all fuses have a voltage rating. To maintain safety, this voltage rating should not be exceeded in application, although it is acceptable to use a higher rated fuse in a lower voltage application. For example: a fuse rated for 125 Volts is appropriate in household (110V) or automotive (12V), while a fuse rated for 32 Volts is appropriate for automotive (12V), but not for household (125V). always replace a fuse with one of the same or higher voltage rating.\"", "label": 0}

The UL-listed alarms are the first and only models to contain a 10-year sensor as well as a sealed-in lithium battery proven to power the alarm for a decade. These two state-of-the-art technologies combine to create a premier level of protection. Digital Display Screen clearly shows the level of CO in that room and updates the reading every 15 seconds. Homeowners have peace of mind knowing their CO alarm is always on, and they never have to be hassled by low-battery chirps or battery replacement. Until now, a CO sensor operated for five to seven years, based on the manufacturer. The Worry-Free alarms last nearly twice as long as the average model. Each year, fire departments respond to an average of 72,000 CO poisoning incidents, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Known as the silent killer, carbon monoxide is odorless, tasteless and invisible. The only safe way to detect it is with a working CO alarm. Industry surveys find approximately half of U.S. homes have a carbon monoxide alarm installed, most of those are battery-operated. A recent survey conducted on behalf of Kidde found homeowners number one fire safety complaint is a low battery chirp. The C3010D carbon monoxide detection unit provides one decade of protection; the sealed lithium batter provides 10 years of continuous power. It is also both maintenance-free and hassle-free; never replace a battery during the alarms operating life and no need to worry about the batteries being removed. Additionally, this Worry Free unit is the longest sensor life available and is proven effective for ten years with quick and easy installation by simply sliding the alarm onto the mounted bracket which activates it automatically. Money savings: no batteries to buy and replace every six months, save up to $40 over the life of the alarm. One single Kidde Worry-Free Digital Carbon Monoxide Alarm.

Which is really a big deal. Since select GE Disposall disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposall disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposall offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposall has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs. All our models operate quietly and some even offer sound reduction technology. The sound reduction package includes a fully insulated sound shell, so our disposers can handle your toughest challenges while minimizing noise. Did you know that Americans throw away nearly 25 percent of all food prepared? And decomposing waste in landfills is one of the largest producers of methane gas, which is the main contributor of global warming?

The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system. Even more, the food-waste disposal features an advanced insulation package that helps ensure super-quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen. Thoughtfully constructed, the food-waste disposal system also provides a two-level precutter, an on/off wall-switch with a sink stopper, a manual-reset overload protector, and a splashguard, as well as stainless-steel, jam-resistant, dual swivel impellers. Other highlights include cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material, a stainless-steel sink flange, and a galvanized-steel turntable. To operate, simply remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, flip the switch to ON, and scrape in the food waste. The continuous-feed disposal takes care of the rest. Before turning the disposal off, let the water and the disposal run for about 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain.

Self Leveling Range: 6deg , Accuracy: 1/4 in. at 100ft., Interior Range (ft.): 100, Battery Life: 30 hrs., Beam (qty.): 3, Leveling Type: Self, Dimensions L x W x H (in.): 1 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 3 1/8, Case Included: Yes, carry bag, Exterior Range (ft.): 100, Battery Type: AA <div class=\"aplus\" > Featuring three bright lines and self-leveling in a six-degree range, the PLS3 point-to-point laser alignment tool from Pacific Laser Systems is easy to set up, understand, and operate. By simplifying layout tasks and quality-control control checks, this tool helps you save time and money on the job, plus it's compact, lightweight, and durable for easy transport. &nbsp; This tool measures 1-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 3-1/8 inches and weighs just 12 ounces for serious portability. It also comes with a carrying pouch to help protect it from the rough realities of construction work. For your convenience, the PLS3 can run for more than 30 hours on three standard AA-sized batteries (included). All PLS tools are designed and manufactured to meet strict quality control guidelines, and the PLS3 is backed by a three-year limited warranty. As a construction professional, you know exactly how time consuming and tricky to master bubble vial levels, plumb-bob setups, and complicated rotary lasers can be. Developed by contractors to help you work more efficiently, the PLS3 point-to-point laser is precise, portable, and simple to use, making it ideal for everything from installing fixtures, doors, and windows to HVAC and electrical work. The PLS3 features three bright, easy-to-see beams, which lets you quickly trace plumb lines from floor to ceiling or from 50 feet off the ground. A strong performer indoors and outdoors, the PLS3 offers a visible indoor working range of 300 feet and a visible outdoor working range of 60 feet. It is accurate within 1/4 inch at 100 feet, and its intuitive design includes a cantilevered nose that makes it easy to see the laser's down beam over two-by-fours, metal tracks, and plates. This is the tool of choice for contractors looking for a laser plumb bob. To help ensure accuracy, if the tool's self-leveling range is exceeded, the beam shuts off automatically to alert you. No pendulum target. Like all PLS point-and-line laser alignment tools, the PLS3 is fully self-leveling, and it takes full advantage of the patented PLS pendulum design and magnetic dampening to deliver real, usable results. Dampening is the settling down effect on the laser beam, and thanks to this advanced technology, all PLS point and line lasers settle down instantly when moved to a new layout point. Additionally, this system compensates for job site vibrations caused by compressors, generators, and other heavy equipment, preventing the laser point from \"jumping\" around and ensuring that your laser delivers accurate, usable information. This helps your team get jobs done right the first time to save you time and money. PLS has upgraded its warranty from a single year to a three-year limited warranty. During this warranty period, your PLS product will be repaired or replaced (with the same or similar model at our option), without charge for either parts or labor, through PLS. If your laser tool ever does need to be serviced, PLS offers fast, 48-hour factory turnaround on repairs or replacements to help ensure that your PLS laser line tool continues to provide accurate performance and improved productivity for the full duration of your career. Built by contractors for contractors, PLS tools were developed out of necessity by professional carpenters with over 50 years of experience in commercial and residential interior and exterior layout, and they're recognized as some of the finest point-to-point and reference line layout tools in the world. Ideal for installing curtain walls, foundations, columns, skylights, doors, cabinetry, and much more, PLS tools combine portability with advanced, utilitarian designs for effective use in situations where traditional bubble vial levels or two-person plumb bob setups are too cumbersome or too limited to get the job done right.

Your Nest Secure can use your smart light bulbs to help get your attention in the event of an emergency; your smart washer and dryer can take the data from Nest and run the next load of laundry when energy demand is low. Look for the Works with Nest badge and let Nest handle the rest. THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE A NEST HOME: We love home. Its the best place in the world. But not everything inside our homes is lovable. Some things beep at us; fail without warning; keep us in the dark. There are things weve learned to ignore. We think these things should do more. Nest is focused on making simple, human, delightful things. Thats how were creating the thoughtful home: A home that takes care of the people inside it and the world around it. Works with Amazon Alexa for voice control (Alexa device sold separately) Auto-Schedule: Nest learns the temperatures you like and programs itself in about a week. Home/Away Assist: Nest automatically turns itself down when nobodys home to help you save energy. Remote Control: Connect your thermostat to Wi-Fi to control the temperature from your phone, tablet or laptop. Farsight: When the Nest Thermostat spots you across the room, it lights up beautifully to show you the time, temperature or weather. Energy Star: First thermostat to earn Energy Star. Your thermostat controls half your energy bill - more than appliances, more than electronics. Saving energy starts with your Thermostat. Energy History: Check your Energy History in the Nest app to see how much energy you use and why. Nest Leaf: Youll see the Leaf when you choose a temperature that saves energy. It guides you in the right direction. <div class=\"sh-dp-rq-device\">                                     <img alt=\"Nest (T3007ES) Learning Thermostat, Easy Temperature Control for Every Room in Your House, Stainless Steel (Third Generation), Works with Alexa\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61z0Flx0L2L._AC_US150_.jpg\" class=\"sh-img\">                                 </div>                                 <span class=\"sh-text a-text-bold\">                                     This item                                 </span> <div class=\"sh-dp-rq-device\">                                             <img alt=\"Alexa device\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/hsx/smart-home/alexa-devices/alexa-echo-group_sq_56-2x.png\" class=\"sh-img\">                                         </div>                                         <p class=\"a-spacing-mini sh-dp-rq-device-title a-text-bold\">Alexa device</p>         <p class=\"sh-dp-rq-device-subtitle\">             8 compatible         </p> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Heating: 1, 2 and 3 stages (W1, W2, W3)             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Cooling: 1 and 2 stages (Y1, Y2)             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Heat pump: with auxiliary and emergency heat (O/B, AUX, E)             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Humidifier or dehumidifier (HUM, DEHUM)             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Fan (G)             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Power (C, RH, RC)             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Wi-Fi connection with Internet access             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Phone or tablet with iOS 8 or later, or Android 4 or later             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Free Nest Account             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 High resolution color screen: 24-bit color LCD, 480 x 480 resolution at 229 pixel per inch (PPI), 2.08&#034; (5.3cm) diameter             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Stainless steel ring             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Sensors: Temperature, Humidity, Near-field activity, Far-field activity, Ambient light             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Languages: English, French, Spanish, Dutch             </span>\" COL description VAL \"The Nest Learning Thermostat is here to help make your home work for you.

Genuine WellerMart Shellac is Guaranteed to your door within 4 business days, usually 2 days. <b>Garnet is one of the most popular colors on the market.</b> Garnet is not only the most affordable but brings out the figure, color and grain of most types of woods. Garnett gives most types of wood a very warm amber tone. It produces wonderful clarity and depth of shine. One of the nicest things about a shellac finish is its ability to really make the grains pop with a high gloss and depth of shine without that typical thick fake plastic look that varnishes so often produce. Shellac is considered to be king of finishes. This has been shown historically with the famous French Polish. High quality dewaxed shellac has many uses not only in antique restoration but refinishing, sealing for other finishes or to hold objects in place to be engraved, chased or diamond setting. Different colors of shellac can be layered to provide various shades on the finished product. This shade looks especially good on lighter colored woods. Shellac also works well with stains, dyes, varnishes, and other coatings such as Waterlox or Polyurethane.\"", "label": 0}

The zinc in this anode rod is designed to combat odor that comes from your hot water tank. Often times when well water is used H2S builds up causing a rotten egg smell to come from your hot water. Zinc counteracts this natural process and eliminates the unwanted odor. This is the Outlet Fitting model of the Blue Lightning Aluminum Flexible Anode Rod combined with the Drainage Kit. This model has a length of 42 inches, a diameter of .75 inches, and 3/4-14 NPT thread size (This sizing should be standard for the bulk of residential water heaters). The rod is broken down into four separate segments. Each segment is Aluminum on a steal rod core. The segments are attached via copper or stainless steel couplers and 301 stainless steel braided wire. All of our Anode Rods are lead free! The Drainage kit comes with a Full Port Brass Valve that provides a 3/4 inch connection compatible with your average garden hose. This provides a method for easily draining your water heater annually to reduce sediment build-up. This valve also provides an opening large enough for a long narrow object to breakup any hardened material that has collected at the bottom of the tank. The Full Port Valve comes with a water tight cap so that you can easily secure the connection when not in use. Together these items can significantly extend the life span of your water heater by preventing damage to the interior of the tank. Our innovatively designed Blue Lightning Aluminum Flexible Rod, also known as a sacrificial rod, is designed to attract the corrosive properties in your water heater tank and break down before the steel interior of the water heater through a process called electrolysis. In many cases, particularly when an aluminium anode rod was used previously, the rod slowly deteriorates and falls to the bottom of the water heater creating a destructive sludge.

Moving blankets are also an invaluable tool for any individual doing a home move, and work great for covering and protecting large valuable items during storage as well. Unlike cheap paper moving pads, moving blankets do not tear during transit, and can be used time and time again. There are three factors to consider when purchasing a moving blanket or pad  weight, binding, and whether the fabric is woven or non-woven. Non-woven polyester is formed of long synthetic fibers that are NOT woven or knitted together, but rather are bonded together by pressure, heat, chemical, or solvent processes. Non-woven blankets are the least resistant to snags and tears and are very economical for one-time moves. Our Econo Mover is 4.5 lbs per blanket, putting it on the lighter end of the scale. It is constructed of a strong, non-woven fabric, and has 3'' non-woven binding on all 4 sides with 4 finished corners. The Econo Mover is one of our more economical blankets, which works great for the occasional, short move, and also can serve as a quality warehouse pad or storage blanket. This blanket has a thick cotton batting for extra padding, making it tougher and more durable than most economy moving pads. It is common to see valuable objects damaged while in transit. However, scuffs, scratches and other deformations can be avoided by wrapping your valuable items with moving blankets.

This Zircon stud finder also comes equipped with a Signal Strength Indicator helps to distinguish between shallow and deep targets. A weak signal can also imply other non-stud objects, like wires and pipes, are present in the area being scanned. The MultiScanner i520 includes ACT (Auto Correcting Technology) that automatically corrects common user errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud, in addition to a low battery indicator to alert its users to replace its battery for optimal performance results. The tool constantly scans its surroundings and recalibrates itself if necessary. In StudScan mode, the Zircon i520 locates the center, edges, and direction of wood or metal studs up to 3/4 (19 mm) of an inch deep. Switch the i520 stud finder over to DeepScan mode and double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep and enables scanning for joists in some ceilings and floors. Metal Scan mode of the MS i520 provides the ability to locate non-ferrous metal, such as copper pipes, up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep and ferrous metal, such as rebar, up to 3 inches (75 mm) deep. Using Metal Scan mode, this Zircon studsensor can find studs behind lath and plaster walls, tile, drywall and stucco walls by identifying the consistent pattern of screw or nail heads in the studs. Additionally, the MultiScanner i520 is programmed with a WireWarning Detection feature that indicates the presence of live unshielded electrical wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep when using the stud and metal scan modes. To detect, locate, map, and trace the live wires, simply switch over to the AC Scan function which acts as a live wire detector and finds and traces live, unshielded AC wiring up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. The Zircon MultiScanner i520 is a perfect choice for serious users, such as home improvement hobbyists and professional contractors.

Where Manila Rope is concerned, the best buy is from the Philippines. Manila rope is made from Abaca fibers, a plant which is a natural resource of the Philippines. Manila rope has some special features that synthetic rope cannot take place: the texture that gives a firm grip with very little stretch; its knot holds well and will not slide; it has a mix of tans, browns and blacks for color and is lightly treated to prevent rot. The tensile strength of Manila Rope is stronger than Sisal rope. Elongation of Manila rope is very minimal compared to synthetic ropes, which were prone to stretching and breaking. Some things to consider before purchasing this manila rope: 1. Your color can vary from the photo in the listing. Manila is made from a natural plant and colors will vary with the season of harvest and growing environment. 2. Manila Rope will shrink once exposed to moisture, much like a cotton T-shirt. Please allow for this. 3. This manila rope has a turpentine smell to it that will eventually fade, but may make it unsuitable for indoor use. This is the preservative that helps prevent rot and mildew. 4. This Manila Rope is not suitable for use with pets, including birds. 5. Manila Rope will require a larger diameter hole than the diameter of the rope, if inserting through a hole. 6. Can give splinters to hands while handling. Twisted Manila Uses: Agricultural functions Nautical applications Construction and industrial supply Mining operations Oil drilling industries Roofers Forest rangers Military people Advantages of Using Manila Rope Firm gripping Knot holds well & will not slide Stronger tensile strength compared to Sisal Rope Minimal elongation limiting stretching & breaking Need a different size, type or length?

The HydroStop replaces flimsy rubber flappers with a sturdy tower and is engineered to eliminate the most common toilet problems. Unlike the angled, floating close of a flapper, the HydroStop drops vertically and solidly onto the flush valve opening to create a better seal and eliminate leaks. The EPA estimates that 20% of all toilets leak up to 200 gallons of water a day, mostly because of faulty flappers. While ordinary flappers are connected to the handle with a thin chain that is subject to improper tension tangles and breakage, the HydroStop features a durable stainless steel cable that is stronger, lasts longer and is less likely to break. The HydroStop also features patented S.T.O.P. Technology (Safe Toilet Overflow Protection) that helps prevent bowl overflows. In the event of a clog, lifting up on the handle immediately drops the HydroStop tower and closes the flush valve so that water does not continue to drain from the tank into the bowl.

The DW089K is ideal for professionals tasked with residential and commercial applications such as installing cabinets, drop ceilings, chair rails or doors and windows. Unlike many line lasers on the market, the DW089K features a second plumb line that forms a 90-Degree intersecting line on the floor and ceiling. This third vertical beam allows contractors to use the tool for layout applications without the need for a second laser, saving time and allowing users to be as productive as possible. For commercial wall layout applications, the DW089K has a track clearance of over 1-3/4-Inch, which means there is no need for additional accessories to raise the laser over drywall track. This Line Laser also has a micro adjust knob for easy alignment, a metal roll cage for durability, and an integrated pivot bracket and universal wall mount that is ideal for acoustical ceiling installation. The micro adjust knob is especially important in that it allows users to steadily adjust the 90-Degree layout lines in small increments without the need to nudge the laser to hit a specific mark. For improved visibility, the beam on the DW089K is two-times brighter than the beam on DEWALT's current line laser. The brighter beam provides increased visibility over long distances as well as in direct sunlight. Accurate within 1/8 of an inch at 30-Feet, the DW089K allows contractors to feel confident in their results when using this product. To alleviate the difficulty professionals often experience when they try to access control panels on the rear of existing units. This is a Class 2 laser product, Power output  1.5mW. 3 Year Warranty\"", "label": 0}

Our urethane resin cast grilles are equal in surface quality to Investment casting or lost wax casting quality at a fraction of the cost. Much superior to the rough and grainy looking surfaces of cast iron or cast aluminum grilles. Maintenance free, you should not have to re-finish, remove rust, corrosion or mold for life of our exterior grade urethane resin grilles. Can be used in damp or wet locations, like exteriors, bathrooms, kitchens and indoor swimming pools or the other rooms on the same HVAC system as the pool room. Frequently used to replace unattractive exhaust fan covers in bathrooms. Easy installation, Pre-drilled screw holes and all necessary hardware provided. Our grilles are flat on the back, with no protrusion that needs to fit into the duct-work. Just place over duct, level and screw in. See attached spec sheet with drawing, measurements, Material Technical Data on resin, plus Free Air Flow and other information. Our grilles will also reduce or eliminate the irritating high pitched noise problems often found with stamped steel louvered return grilles. Urethane resin grilles will not vibrate and make noise like metal grilles do. Use our grilles to replace noisy high pitched metal return grilles, your ears will be glad you did. Arts & Crafts Style Grille; historic reproduction of possibly the best looking grille ever made in USA, Circa 1870's Use to replace old louvered grilles for wall & ceiling only (not for floors). Meets U.S. Governments General Services Administration code #1501003S standards for Historic Preservation Guidelines, for grilles in historic buildings. Use these grilles in new homes that want the traditional look or historic homes that need to preserve their vintage character.\" COL description VAL \"This grille is an American Classic, made after the end of the Civil War in Brooklyn New York from 1865 to 1922. Due to the fine detail they were cast in the lost wax method, rather than the less expensive but grainy sand casting. Their quality and detail soon attracted the eye of Andrew Carnegie, Americas first half-billionaire. Starting in 1886, his philanthropy period, he built 1,689 Carnegie Libraries all over the USA. Most all these libraries were built in the Beaux-Arts style of architecture and used these grilles exclusively for heating and ventilation purposes. They were also bought for fine homes everywhere. Today, this Arts & Crafts style grille can be used as return air registers, supply vents, vent covers, speaker grilles, radiator grilles, crawl space grilles and more. They are specifically designed for wall and ceiling installation, but not for floor use. They are cast from industrial quality urethane resin, which faithfully reproduces the details of the originals. In addition Urethane resin is impervious to water and can be used in damp or wet locations, such as a decorative cover for your bathroom exhaust fan, or in and around an indoor swimming pool. Steel grilles will soon rust in either location. In addition resin grilles will not vibrate and make high pitched noises like metal returns, so use to reduce or eliminate the noise issues of metal grilles. As for finishes, we developed an in-house technique to infuse metallic powders into the front surface of the mold prior to casting, resulting in a cold-fused metallic-plated surface, which is virtually maintenance free. Available finishes are, Rubbed Bronze, Antique Brass, Pewter, Old Wood, Dark Bronze, Nickel, Antique Cherry and Black. We also suggest painting your duct-work behind the grille with flat black paint, before installation. Pre-drilled screw-holes and all necessary hardware are provided to make installation easy. We currently offer these style grilles in 63 different sizes.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Decorative Grille, Vent Cover, or Return Register.

It is powered by two AA replaceable alkaline batteries for each unit, giving you peace of mind even during power outages. The test/silence button both silences the alarm and allows you to test its functionality. The unit monitors and re-alarms if carbon monoxide levels persist sounding a loud 85-decibel horn. No installation is required and the attractive design allows the unit to be placed anywhere you need it. An audible and visual low battery signal alerts you to replace the battery.

Gorilla Wood Glue, a PVA glue, offers the benefits of an easy-to use, water-based adhesive, with the holding power Gorilla is known for. This PVA glue is incredibly water resistant and dries a natural color that offers an invisible bond line for your projects. Directions: For best results, it is essential that the wood surfaces are prepared prior to application of glue. For laminating, the surfaces should be planed smooth, leaving the board surface free from machine marks, tear-out and snipes. Also, be careful to avoid burnishing and end snipes. In general, apply a generous amount of glue on one of the surfaces. On hard-to-glue woods, apply the glue on both surfaces. Rub together with the other surface to distribute the glue evenly on both surfaces. Enough glue should be applied so that a fine bead of glue squeeze-out will occur when clamping. Coverage: One gallon of Gorilla Wood Glue will cover about 200 square feet. One fluid ounce will cover approximately 1.6 square feet. Clamping: The technique and type of clamp to be used is determined by many factors. In general, apply enough pressure that will cause a fine bead of glue to squeeze out when the proper pressure is applied. Clamping Time (amount of time pressure needs to remain applied): 2030 minutes for room temperature applications. The temperature must be above 55F. Note that clamping time can be dependent on temperature, humidity, and the porosity of the wood. Cure Time (amount of time for glue to reach total bonding strength): 24 hours. Clean up while glue is wet: Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe off excess glue. When areas have completely dried, sand as needed.

This is the first portable tester for quickly measuring hay in the windrow, before baling. Finally, you can drive out to the windrow and check moisture content without committing to the time and expense of using your baling or chopping equipment before the hay is at the correct moisture. Testing is easy! Add loose hay or forage to a 5-gallon bucket (not included) and press tester into the hay or forage for measurement. Time from sample to test result: 30 seconds to one minute.

By simplifying layout tasks and quality-control control checks, this tool helps you save time and money on the job, plus it's compact, lightweight, and durable for easy transport. &nbsp; This tool measures 1-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 3-1/8 inches and weighs just 12 ounces for serious portability. It also comes with a carrying pouch to help protect it from the rough realities of construction work. For your convenience, the PLS3 can run for more than 30 hours on three standard AA-sized batteries (included). All PLS tools are designed and manufactured to meet strict quality control guidelines, and the PLS3 is backed by a three-year limited warranty. As a construction professional, you know exactly how time consuming and tricky to master bubble vial levels, plumb-bob setups, and complicated rotary lasers can be. Developed by contractors to help you work more efficiently, the PLS3 point-to-point laser is precise, portable, and simple to use, making it ideal for everything from installing fixtures, doors, and windows to HVAC and electrical work. The PLS3 features three bright, easy-to-see beams, which lets you quickly trace plumb lines from floor to ceiling or from 50 feet off the ground. A strong performer indoors and outdoors, the PLS3 offers a visible indoor working range of 300 feet and a visible outdoor working range of 60 feet. It is accurate within 1/4 inch at 100 feet, and its intuitive design includes a cantilevered nose that makes it easy to see the laser's down beam over two-by-fours, metal tracks, and plates. This is the tool of choice for contractors looking for a laser plumb bob. To help ensure accuracy, if the tool's self-leveling range is exceeded, the beam shuts off automatically to alert you. No pendulum target. Like all PLS point-and-line laser alignment tools, the PLS3 is fully self-leveling, and it takes full advantage of the patented PLS pendulum design and magnetic dampening to deliver real, usable results. Dampening is the settling down effect on the laser beam, and thanks to this advanced technology, all PLS point and line lasers settle down instantly when moved to a new layout point. Additionally, this system compensates for job site vibrations caused by compressors, generators, and other heavy equipment, preventing the laser point from \"jumping\" around and ensuring that your laser delivers accurate, usable information. This helps your team get jobs done right the first time to save you time and money. PLS has upgraded its warranty from a single year to a three-year limited warranty. During this warranty period, your PLS product will be repaired or replaced (with the same or similar model at our option), without charge for either parts or labor, through PLS. If your laser tool ever does need to be serviced, PLS offers fast, 48-hour factory turnaround on repairs or replacements to help ensure that your PLS laser line tool continues to provide accurate performance and improved productivity for the full duration of your career. Built by contractors for contractors, PLS tools were developed out of necessity by professional carpenters with over 50 years of experience in commercial and residential interior and exterior layout, and they're recognized as some of the finest point-to-point and reference line layout tools in the world. Ideal for installing curtain walls, foundations, columns, skylights, doors, cabinetry, and much more, PLS tools combine portability with advanced, utilitarian designs for effective use in situations where traditional bubble vial levels or two-person plumb bob setups are too cumbersome or too limited to get the job done right.
