It contains live marine shrimp, live algae and microorganisms. All composing elements exist and interact with each other in an attractively designed, high quality clear glass bubble filled with filtered brackish water. No frequent water changes, No daily feeding, No water filtration. Just provide your Shrimp Bubble with indirect natural or artificial light and enjoy observing its gradual development. <b>How it works:</b> The algae use light and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. The oxygen is liberated into the water and is used by the shrimp for breathing. The shrimp feed on algae and microorganisms and release waste and carbon dioxide into the water. Microorganisms feed on shrimps waste and brake it down into dissolved simple inorganic nutrients. The algae use the nutrients and the carbon dioxide for growth, thus closing the symbiotic cycle. The greatest benefit of the semi-closed Shrimp Bubble Ecosystem is that one is able to remove the top and, every once in awhile feed the shrimp for a boost of extra energy or intervene to maintain good water quality if the system goes off balance, thus increasing the chances of a long term success. One may also recharge the Shrimp Bubble ecosystem by simply buying a live shrimp replacement kit. The Shrimp Bubble Ecosystem Kit comes pre-assembled inside the clear glass bubble.

Lucy then realized that dehydrating whole foods made mealtimes much simpler while maintaining the natural health benefits of the ingredients. From there, The Honest Kitchen was born - and her kitchen stayed much cleaner! Today, The Honest Kitchen is on a mission to revolutionize the pet food industry through their obsession with product integrity and commitment to help as many pets as possible get on the road to good health through natural, wholesome proper food.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Primal Freeze Dried Dog Food Venison Formula\" COL feature VAL \"Primal Freeze-Dried Formulas Are Produced Using Only The Freshest, Human-Grade Ingredients.

The grooved surface provides a safe non-slip platform for a dog's paws; we don't use abrasive coatings like sand paper that may deteriorate the ramp over time and cause damage to your clothes or vehicle, not to mention your dog's paws. You can use your PetSTEP ramp in any weather condition without worrying if your pet will sustain an injury while in use. Included is a side support strap unique to only the PetSTEP ramps; its purpose is to provide support for use in the back seat of any vehicle. The strap, which is made of heavy duty nylon, allows a person to easily connect one end of the strap to the ramp, while the other end slips over the frame of your door. This allows your pet to climb into your vehicle without the ramp tipping on its own.\" COL description VAL \"The PetSTEP folding pet ramp makes it easy for your dog to get in and out of your SUV, van, truck, trailer or swimming pool. If your dog is a senior, injured or otherwise unable to jump up or down, he or she needs a PetSTEP ramp!  The PetSTEP has a soft non-slip ridged rubber surface not found on other ramps protecting paws and provides superior wet or dry traction. The ramp opens and closes with ease by unhooking the spring latch at one end of the ramp. The advanced plastic and fiberglass material is light yet strong allowing the ramp to hold any size dog. Weighing at just 18.5lbs and has built-in carry handles for ease of transport and is easily stored away. The heavy-duty rubber grips at each end keep the ramp in place during use. Easily washable with soap and water.  Ramp measures 70\" long x 17\" wide when unfolded; 37\" long when folded in half for transport or storage.   Along with the ramp is a side door strap, FREE!  Many vehicles on the road today are not designed with wide rear door openings.  What does this mean?  Well, when placing your ramp in the rear door, one corner will rest on the seat, but due to limited space, the other corner will hang in the air.  You wouldn't want your pet climbing a ramp that's visually unstable, so we created the support strap, unique to only this PetSTEP ramp.  One end connects to the airborne corner, while the other end sits or rests on your door frame.  The strap is adjustable so it'll work with coupe's to crossovers to pickup trucks.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Booyah Small Dog Pet Bike Bicycle Trailer Pet Trailer Green\" COL feature VAL \"We DO NOT ship to PO Boxes, APO or FPO.

The motorized translucent door panel is made of super-strength, bulletproof, military-grade resin. It wont break, crack or discolor, even in extreme heat and cold. Activated by a tiny waterproof ultrasonic collar (included), the airtight panel quickly and quietly powers upward, disappearing into the stylish housing. This method of automating pet doors is unique in the market, as most electronic doors simply unlock a hinged panel, allowing the pet to push through a flap. Only POWER PET doors use a patented directional ultrasonic sensing system. This system has great advantages over magnetic or radio transmitter collars. Magnetic collars have a very limited range making it difficult to train the pet to operate the door. Radio systems have good range but open whenever the animal is within that range, even if the pet is sitting, sleeping or just wandering by.<br> <br> POWER PETs directional ultrasonic system overcomes these problems. The ultrasonic collar emits a highly directional signal, which is received by the microphone only when your pet is directly facing the door opening. The unit is not likely to trigger if your pet is just wandering by.</td> <td valign=\"top\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/oval_illustration2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\"></td> </tr> </table> <h4>Airtight and Secure</h4> Motorizing the panel and causing it to move up and down allows it to be mounted in hermetically sealed grooves for absolutely air-tight closure, resulting in the best insulated pet door made. In fact, POWER PET doors insulate better than the best dual-flap pet doors, protecting against extreme cold and windy conditions. Mounting the rigid panel in grooves also makes it impossible for an intruder to kick it in. There's one, and only one way that the panel can be opened; it must slide upward. An auto-locking steel deadbolt makes that impossible without engaging the motor. POWER PET doors are intrinsically safe. They use an electric motor and cable drive to lift the door panel. The panel remains open until the pet collar signal is gone, indicating that your pet is clear of the opening. When the collar signal is gone, power to the motor is turned off and the panel is returned by the force of gravity only. Downward speed is reduced by an electronic brake applied to the reverse motion of the motor. This brake operates with or without electrical power. Because the panel is returned by simple gravity, the maximum force that can be applied by the panel when it is closing is limited to its own weight, about 2 pounds. As an added safety feature, the door also has a sensing system that automatically raises the panel should it encounter an obstruction on the way down. This feature can be defeated in the unusual case that binding or other restriction slows the door closure to the point that it unnecessarily retracts. <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/controls2._V356527339_.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\"> A full set of controls and indicators give you maximum control over the door's operation. <b>1. 110 volt AC wall outlet:</b> POWER PET doors come standard with a UL approved AC adapter. Plug the adapter into a nearby wall outlet for continuous operation. With dual jacks, the cord can be connected to either the left or right side of the door. <b>2. AC with battery backup:</b> You may purchase an optional <a href=\"#accessories\"> rechargeable battery</a> for use along with your AC adapter. If your household electricity should ever fail, your POWER PET door will automatically switch over to battery operation. When power is restored, the AC adapter will automatically recharge your battery. <b>3. Full battery operation:</b> You may also operate your POWER PET door with the battery only. This eliminates the need for the AC adapter or any electrical power connection. However, you will need to recharge the battery periodically (recharge interval varies depending upon use). In this case, we recommend that you purchase the optional <a href=\"#accessories\"> charger kit with 2 backup batteries</a>. With two batteries, you can use one in your POWER PET door and keep the other in the charger. When your door battery runs low, just swap. POWER PET doors are available in two sizes: <b>Medium</b> for pets up to 30 pounds (8-1/4&quot;W x 10&quot;H opening), and <b>Large</b> for pets up to 100 pounds (12-1/4&quot;W x 16&quot;H opening). If the unit is to be mounted in a door up to 1-3/4 inches thick, there is no framing necessary. The included outer frame provides a finished look to the opening. If you are installing your POWER PET door in a wall, it is advisable to build a frame around the opening or order the <a href=\"#accessories\">optional wall adapter tunnel</a>. <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/wall2.jpg\" width=\"259\" height=\"299\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/door2.jpg\" width=\"259\" height=\"299\"> Pre-assembled sliding glass patio door inserts are made of high quality aluminum and tempered glass and coated with an industrial quality powder coat finish.

What you should do; Unfold the training pad and place it in a confined area. (Blue plastic side down). It is important to place your puppy or dog on the training pad several times a day in order to get him used it. on the average, a puppy must relieve himself every few hours, based on his age (a 2 month old puppy every 2 hours, a 3 month old every hours etc). If your pet relieves himself somewhere other than the designated spot where the pad is placed, bring him back to the correct spot immediately. Keep in mind that your pet will have to relive himself shortly after a meal and will need to eliminate more frequently during the summer when his water intake is higher. The minute your dog begins to relieve himself on the pad, be sure to use cures like go potty. You should use this cue every time that your dog relives himself on the pad so that he associates the phrase with the action of elimination. Every time that your pet used the pad successfully, make sure that you give him a treat and lots of praise. Treating helps your dog to understand that he is doing what you want him to do. Always remember to dispose of soiled pads and replace them as needed. When your pet begins to relieve himself on the pads, on consistent basic, it is time to begin moving the pad closer to the door. Keep moving the pads closer to the door until they are actually outside. At this time, the training process will be complete.\"", "label": 0}

Phycox is natural phycocyanin, extracted from blue-green algae. Phycocyanin has been found to be a completely selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which therefore makes it not only a potent anti-inflammatory but also free from the side effects caused by drugs that inhibit COX-1. COX-1 is found in all cells of the body; it produces protective prostaglandins in the kidney and stomach and is important in blood clotting. Drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which generally inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, therefore cause potentially fatal side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration and coagulation disorders. Phycox is completely free from these side effects and so can be given safely to horses of all ages, whether they are healthy or have other concurrent medical issues.

COX-1 is found in all cells of the body; it produces protective prostaglandins in the kidney and stomach and is important in blood clotting. Drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which generally inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, therefore cause potentially fatal side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration and coagulation disorders. Phycox is completely free from these side effects and so can be given safely to horses of all ages, whether they are healthy or have other concurrent medical issues.

It is not necessary to add supplemental vitamins or minerals. Food consumption can vary during gestation. Feed the amount needed to maintain ideal body condition in the pregnant female. After kittens are born, feed the nursing female all she wants to eat. Food intake can be 2(en)3 times greater by the fourth week of lactation as it was prior to when the female was bred. Food intake can be increased by feeding Pro Plan moistened with water and feeding twice daily. Kitten Feeding: Kittens generally nibble solid foods at 3(en)4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Pro Plan available to these kittens at all times. After weaning, at 6(en)8 weeks of age, kittens will normally eat dry or moistened food at will. If water is added, use no more than one part warm (not hot) liquid to three parts Pro Plan, changing frequently to ensure freshness. As kittens near adulthood, their calorie needs may decrease. Continue to adjust the amount you feed to maintain your kitten in ideal body condition and avoid excess weight gain. Making the Switch to Pro Plan: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Pro Plan can make in your kitten, please allow 7(en)10 days to ease the transition from your kitten's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Pro Plan until you're feeding Pro Plan exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Store in a cool, dry place.

What you should do; Unfold the training pad and place it in a confined area. (Blue plastic side down). It is important to place your puppy or dog on the training pad several times a day in order to get him used it. on the average, a puppy must relieve himself every few hours, based on his age (a 2 month old puppy every 2 hours, a 3 month old every hours etc). If your pet relieves himself somewhere other than the designated spot where the pad is placed, bring him back to the correct spot immediately. Keep in mind that your pet will have to relive himself shortly after a meal and will need to eliminate more frequently during the summer when his water intake is higher. The minute your dog begins to relieve himself on the pad, be sure to use cures like go potty. You should use this cue every time that your dog relives himself on the pad so that he associates the phrase with the action of elimination. Every time that your pet used the pad successfully, make sure that you give him a treat and lots of praise. Treating helps your dog to understand that he is doing what you want him to do. Always remember to dispose of soiled pads and replace them as needed. When your pet begins to relieve himself on the pads, on consistent basic, it is time to begin moving the pad closer to the door. Keep moving the pads closer to the door until they are actually outside.

When it comes to our dog beds, we dont cut corners. Every single one of our products is made from only the highest-quality materials to ensure that your dog bed will last for years. Constructed of our own proprietary ripstop ballistic material, our Tough series dog beds and crate pads are the most chew-resistant cushion beds available. These densely woven covers will resist tearing and scratching, and the Ripstop pattern of fibers prevents small holes from growing in size. The smooth, canvas-like texture of the pad allows dirt, fur, and liquids to slide right off, so cleanup is a breeze. Most messes can be simply wiped up with a damp towel, but these pads can be machine-washed whole in cold water on a delicate cycle if needed. The Tough crate pad is filled with dense, polyester stuffing to give it a plump shape and to cushion your dog from the hard crate bottom. It is fully enclosed, sealed tight around all edges with double-stitching for extra strength, and gives your dog no zippers or Velcro closures to fixate on. Experienced dog owners know that theres nothing out there short of hard metal thats truly chew-proof; dogs have been known to chew through Kevlar, sheetrock, and chain-link fencing, to name a few, but when it comes to a soft, pillow-style bed, our Tough beds really are the toughest on the market. The Tough Crate Pad has a Chew Proof Rating of 4 out of 5, meaning that it will stand up to 90% of chewers and works best for light or moderate chewers. The flexibility and thinness of this pad make it easier for a dog to pinch between its jaws, so it isnt recommended for dogs that chew constantly when crated. For a heavy or persistent chewer, only our Ballistic Chew Proof Cot will do (and yes, it can indeed be used in a wire crate).

The motorized translucent door panel is made of super-strength, bulletproof, military-grade resin. It wont break, crack or discolor, even in extreme heat and cold. Activated by a tiny waterproof ultrasonic collar (included), the airtight panel quickly and quietly powers upward, disappearing into the stylish housing. This method of automating pet doors is unique in the market, as most electronic doors simply unlock a hinged panel, allowing the pet to push through a flap. Only POWER PET doors use a patented directional ultrasonic sensing system. This system has great advantages over magnetic or radio transmitter collars. Magnetic collars have a very limited range making it difficult to train the pet to operate the door. Radio systems have good range but open whenever the animal is within that range, even if the pet is sitting, sleeping or just wandering by.<br> <br> POWER PETs directional ultrasonic system overcomes these problems. The ultrasonic collar emits a highly directional signal, which is received by the microphone only when your pet is directly facing the door opening. The unit is not likely to trigger if your pet is just wandering by.</td> <td valign=\"top\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/oval_illustration2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\"></td> </tr> </table> <h4>Airtight and Secure</h4> Motorizing the panel and causing it to move up and down allows it to be mounted in hermetically sealed grooves for absolutely air-tight closure, resulting in the best insulated pet door made. In fact, POWER PET doors insulate better than the best dual-flap pet doors, protecting against extreme cold and windy conditions. Mounting the rigid panel in grooves also makes it impossible for an intruder to kick it in. There's one, and only one way that the panel can be opened; it must slide upward. An auto-locking steel deadbolt makes that impossible without engaging the motor. POWER PET doors are intrinsically safe. They use an electric motor and cable drive to lift the door panel. The panel remains open until the pet collar signal is gone, indicating that your pet is clear of the opening. When the collar signal is gone, power to the motor is turned off and the panel is returned by the force of gravity only. Downward speed is reduced by an electronic brake applied to the reverse motion of the motor. This brake operates with or without electrical power. Because the panel is returned by simple gravity, the maximum force that can be applied by the panel when it is closing is limited to its own weight, about 2 pounds. As an added safety feature, the door also has a sensing system that automatically raises the panel should it encounter an obstruction on the way down. This feature can be defeated in the unusual case that binding or other restriction slows the door closure to the point that it unnecessarily retracts. <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/controls2._V356527339_.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\"> A full set of controls and indicators give you maximum control over the door's operation. <b>1. 110 volt AC wall outlet:</b> POWER PET doors come standard with a UL approved AC adapter. Plug the adapter into a nearby wall outlet for continuous operation. With dual jacks, the cord can be connected to either the left or right side of the door. <b>2. AC with battery backup:</b> You may purchase an optional <a href=\"#accessories\"> rechargeable battery</a> for use along with your AC adapter. If your household electricity should ever fail, your POWER PET door will automatically switch over to battery operation. When power is restored, the AC adapter will automatically recharge your battery. <b>3. Full battery operation:</b> You may also operate your POWER PET door with the battery only. This eliminates the need for the AC adapter or any electrical power connection. However, you will need to recharge the battery periodically (recharge interval varies depending upon use). In this case, we recommend that you purchase the optional <a href=\"#accessories\"> charger kit with 2 backup batteries</a>. With two batteries, you can use one in your POWER PET door and keep the other in the charger. When your door battery runs low, just swap. POWER PET doors are available in two sizes: <b>Medium</b> for pets up to 30 pounds (8-1/4&quot;W x 10&quot;H opening), and <b>Large</b> for pets up to 100 pounds (12-1/4&quot;W x 16&quot;H opening). If the unit is to be mounted in a door up to 1-3/4 inches thick, there is no framing necessary. The included outer frame provides a finished look to the opening. If you are installing your POWER PET door in a wall, it is advisable to build a frame around the opening or order the <a href=\"#accessories\">optional wall adapter tunnel</a>. <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/wall2.jpg\" width=\"259\" height=\"299\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/door2.jpg\" width=\"259\" height=\"299\"> Pre-assembled sliding glass patio door inserts are made of high quality aluminum and tempered glass and coated with an industrial quality powder coat finish.

Equine joints can deteriorate quickly; factors such as turnout availability, riding, driving, footing, and especially anatomical imperfections can increase the concussion and compression of your horses joints.

Hyaluronic acid supplements with a high molecular weight are a easy, tasteless solution for supporting joints and cartilage naturally, and keeping your horse healthy, happy and cared for.

One full trigger squeeze of Hyalun Pro 30 in your horses mouth daily gives your horse the joint support it needs. What is Hyaluronic Acid? Hyaluronic Acid is the motor oil for the joint. HA is a mucopolysaccharide that occurs naturally throughout the horses body. Backed by thousands of clinical trials in the fields of orthopedics and eye surgery, HA lubricates joints as an integral component of synovial fluid. Why is the molecular weight of supplemental Hyaluronic Acid important? There are more benefits derived from higher molecular weight acid. The higher molecular weight acid can hold more water, thus better lubrication properties. HyalunPro is one of the purest and highest in molecular weight. How does Hyaluronic Acid compare to glucosamine or chondroitin? Glucosamine is a precursor of Hyaluronic Acid. HA in turn makes the synovial fluid. Glucosamine must combine with a glucoronic acid molecule to make Hyaluronic Acid. Often times the body is not able to join these two molecules together and the production of the much needed HA is not optimal. By administering Hyaluronic Acid, you take away the risk of this integral process not happening. WHY HYALOGIC? Your pets are a part of your family. They depend on you. At Hyalogic, we focus on the natural, well-being of your beloved pets. When we develop our premium, hyaluronic acid products, we consider not just your pets, but you; the people who love them. A healthy pet makes your life easier, too. We understand the unconditional love our pets give us and we create products that help you give that love back.

The tray is completely disposable for hands off convenience. It is pre-filled with Premium Blue litter, which has been proven to provide unbeatable odor control. You don't have to see, touch, or smell messy waste. Simply replace the disposable tray every few weeks, and your ScoopFree litter box is just like new. Completely disposable, so you don't have to see, touch, or smell messy waste. Covered waste trap locks in odor and leaves litter smelling clean and fresh. Plastic lining creates a powerful barrier to help protect against leakage. Crystal litter doesn't clog rake or clump to the bottom of the tray. Safe for all cats. Weighs only 6.5 pounds (includes 4.5 pounds of litter). Litter is low tracking and 99% dust free. Absorbs urine on contact and dries solid waste to reduce odor. Uses 5 to 10 times less than clay and clumping litter, so there's less to buy and bring home. We recommend replacing the litter tray at least once every 2030 days for one cat, every 1015 days for 2 cats, every 710 days for 3 cats. Tip: ScoopFree litter trays can be used by themselves as disposable litter boxes. When used this way, either scoop the waste under the waste trap flap or remove entirely as often as needed. Mixing the litter daily is also recommended. When the tray is ready to be disposed, simply cover it and toss it in the trash.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"PetSafe ScoopFree Ultra Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box, Covered, Automatic with Disposable Tray, 2 Color Options\" COL feature VAL \"SELF-CLEANING LITTER BOX: Self-cleans for weeks with no scooping, cleaning or refilling UNBEATABLE ODOR CONTROL: Crystal cat litter absorbs urine and dehydrates solid waste to remove odors; covered trap locks away solid waste and odor so you never have to touch or see smelly waste LESS MESS: Low-tracking crystals dont stick to your cats feet and are 99% dust-free LEAK PROTECTION: Plastic tray lining creates a powerful extra barrier to help protect against leakage EASY, CONVENIENT CLEANUP: No scooping required; simply remove the disposable litter tray and throw it away PEACE OF MIND: Health counter tracks how many times your cat uses the box and safety sensors automatically reset the rake timer if your cat re-enters the box EXPERIENCE: PetSafe brand has been an industry leading U.S. manufacturer of pet behavior, containment and lifestyle products since 1991, helping millions of people and pets each year <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 No more clumps to scrape or scoop              </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Self-cleans for weeks with no maintenance             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Crystal litter absorbs moisture for maximum odor control               </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Non-tracking crystal litter keeps your floors clean               </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Safe and hygienic for you and your cat             </span> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">5x better odor control</span>: absorbs liquids and dries out solid waste <span class=\"a-text-bold\">99% dust free</span>: for fresh air and a clean home <span class=\"a-text-bold\">Non-tracking</span>: crystal litter stays in the box and off your floors <span class=\"a-text-bold\">Lightweight</span>: no more lifting heavy bags or tubs of litter\" COL description VAL \" The PetSafe ScoopFree Ultra Self-Cleaning Litter Box is an innovative, automatic litter box that stays fresh and clean without the hassle.

This comprehensive blend of ingredients helps to optimize support of the structure and function of synovial joints in cats with increased need for joint support. GlycOmega&reg; contains all major classes of GAGs that occur in connective tissue (joint cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and synovial fluids) like chondroitin sulfates and hyaluronic acid. Over 17 years, researchers have conducted several studies to determine the abilities of Glyco-Flexs&reg; main ingredients and the product as a whole. The GlycOmega&reg; (Perna used in Glyco-Flex) is exclusive to Vetri-Science.&reg; Out of top selling brands, Glyco-Flex&reg; is the only joint support product line registered with the FDA as an animal health product. The GlycOmega&reg; Perna whole mussel (used exclusively in Vetri-Science GlycoFlex&reg; products) is the only New Zealand green lipped mussel clinically researched for its impact on the bodys inflammatory response. Glyco-Flex&reg; II Feline features our patented DMG, an adaptogen known for its immune support properties. DMG is naturally occurring in small amounts, and assists in methylation processes within the body. This amino acid derivative supports circulation and oxygen utilization, promoting better nutrient delivery to the joint. Vetri-Science&reg; Laboratories has obtained four patents on DMG backed by 20 years of research. Because Glyco-Flex&reg; II Feline is designed to represent serious support; weve added MSM to our tablet and chewable formulas. MSM, or Methylsulfonylmethane, is an organic, sulfur-containing compound. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the fundamental building blocks of joint cartilage, are linked together by disulfide bonds (bonds between two sulfur atoms). Because cartilage is in a sulfur-dependent state of quality, MSM supports joint and connective tissue health. Glyco-Flex&reg; II stands out because of added glucosamine. A natural compound found in healthy cartilage, glucosamine sulfate is a constituent of glycosaminoglycans in synovial fluid, meaning it supports joint health through promoting synovial fluid viscosity and strength of the cartilage matrix. Available in both a tablet formula and a chicken liver-flavored bite size chew, Glyco-Flex&reg; II Feline is known for its high palatability.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Nutramax Dasuquin For Cats\" COL feature VAL \"Joint health supplement Formulated with glucosamine and chondroitin Most complete joint support supplement available Capsules for cats\" COL description VAL \"A new joint health supplement for cats.

This ReptileUV Mega Ray original design provides the necessary UVB, UVA and heat for your UVB-dependent basking reptiles. Using cutting edge technology coupled with five years of dedicated research and testing, we have conquered and significantly reduced the huge decay rates so common in other Mercury Vapor lamps. While other bulbs decay as much as 80%, our newly designed SB bulbs decay less than 30% over the life of the bulb. This is unseen in the industry. Our ReptileUV original design Mega Ray SB 160 watt Narrow Flood Lamp produces more UVB than other true Mercury Vapor Floods, yet is safer for owners! Our design directs the majority of the UVB from the face of the bulb, rather than diffuse it across a 180 angle. Mega-Ray SB 160-watt narrow-flood is a 160-watt SB Par-38 True Frosted Flood Lamp. A true flood lamp, it will disperse usable UVB in a 30\" circumference at a 20\" distance. MINIMUM distance setting of 18\" will produce approximately a UVI reading of 5-7 and 900-1200uW/cm2 of UVA. MAXIMUM distance setting of 24\" will produce about a 3 UVI reading (Distance is measured from lamp face to basking spot or reptile for optimum UVB and heat.) Most people with UVB or UVI meters are getting 18+ months use out of our SB bulbs. This 160-watt self-ballasted bulb also produces heat.

Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone. Dingo comes in different shapes, flavors and functional forms:\"", "label": 0}

STEP 1: Hang the bells on the handle of the door you use to take your dog out. You can also hang them on a hook next to the door (a suitable hook can be found at any hardware store). STEP 2: Whenever you take your dog out, allow the dog to move or otherwise interact with the door knob bells. When he/she does so, ring the bells and state a command associated with going outside. Provide positive verbal feedback and take your dog out. STEP 3: Repeat the process, always giving the same command and praise. Make sure that you don't distract your dog from going to the bathroom by playing after you take him/her outside. If you're going outside to play , don't use the hanging house training bells. After a few weeks of this routine, most dogs will begin ringing the bells on their own. When they do so, it is VERY IMPORTANT to take them out right away to reinforce the conditioning. Bell training for dogs has been shown to be highly effective, with many trainers and books recommending dog door bells for potty training over other doggie potty training devices / aids.

This ReptileUV Mega Ray original design provides the necessary UVB, UVA and heat for your UVB-dependent basking reptiles. Using cutting edge technology coupled with five years of dedicated research and testing, we have conquered and significantly reduced the huge decay rates so common in other Mercury Vapor lamps. While other bulbs decay as much as 80%, our newly designed SB bulbs decay less than 30% over the life of the bulb. This is unseen in the industry. Our ReptileUV original design Mega Ray SB 160 watt Narrow Flood Lamp produces more UVB than other true Mercury Vapor Floods, yet is safer for owners! Our design directs the majority of the UVB from the face of the bulb, rather than diffuse it across a 180 angle. Mega-Ray SB 160-watt narrow-flood is a 160-watt SB Par-38 True Frosted Flood Lamp. A true flood lamp, it will disperse usable UVB in a 30\" circumference at a 20\" distance. MINIMUM distance setting of 18\" will produce approximately a UVI reading of 5-7 and 900-1200uW/cm2 of UVA. MAXIMUM distance setting of 24\" will produce about a 3 UVI reading (Distance is measured from lamp face to basking spot or reptile for optimum UVB and heat.) Most people with UVB or UVI meters are getting 18+ months use out of our SB bulbs. This 160-watt self-ballasted bulb also produces heat. It is very important that you monitor the heat at the basking area and adjust the fixture-to-basking area distance accordingly to maintain a proper heat gradient.

This Mega Ray Pet Care Lighting original design provides the necessary UVB, UVA and heat for your UVB-dependent basking reptiles. More UVB - But Safer Our Mega-Ray SB 100 watt Narrow Flood Lamp produces more UVB than other true Mercury Vapor Floods, yet is safer for owners! Our design directs the majority of the UVB from the face of the bulb, rather than diffuse it across a 180 angle. Longer Useful Life Using cutting edge technology coupled with five years of dedicated research and testing, we have conquered and significantly reduced the huge decay rates so common in other Mercury Vapor lamps. While other bulbs decay as much as 80%, our newly designed SB bulbs decay less than 30% over the life of the bulb. This is unseen in the industry.

MINIMUM distance setting of 12\" will produce approximately 150-200 microwatts per square centimeter (uW/cm2) of UVB and 900-1200uW/cm2 of UVA. MAXIMUM distance setting of 20\" will produce 50-75 microwatts per square centimeter (uW/cm2) of UVB. (Distance is measured from lamp face to basking spot or reptile for optimum UVB and heat.) Most people with UVB meters are getting 18+ months use out of our SB bulbs. Warning: Heat This 100-watt self-ballasted bulb also produces heat. It is very important that you monitor the heat at the basking area and adjust the fixture-to-basking area distance accordingly to maintain a proper heat gradient.

Wholistic Digest-All Plus is a pure blend of active non-genetically engineered enzymes with concentrated probiotics that will help your pet unlock the valuable nutrients in food and have an optimally functioning, very healthy digestive system. Enzymes are inherent to all life processes and are integral to the proper functioning of all body systems. Your pet could actually be missing out on the nutrients from the food he eats!

When foods are not digested properly, the nutrients that your pet would ordinarily obtain from food may not be available. Eventually the immune system can ultimately be affected.
