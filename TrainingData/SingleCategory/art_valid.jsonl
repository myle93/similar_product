You get the best of both worlds. Once applied, all the water in the paint evaporates quickly in the atmosphere to leave a flexible acrylic film of color behind. This is permanent and doesnt move - which means you can overpaint or varnish without bleeding to achieve multi-layered surface effects. Sheer or solid color, or something in between? Each pigment has its own unique character and this dictates its opacity. Our professional acrylic paint is formulated to let the pigment express itself fully, so you have a choice of opaque, semi-opaque and transparent colors to help you achieve a range of effects. Check the opacity symbol on the barrel. On a clients wall. In a gallery. Your work needs to stay as you intended. The pigments in Acrylic Markers are lightfast. This means your work will have the greatest archival permanence possible  at least 50 years+ in gallery conditions  with no color shifting or fading, to stay vibrant and true. A ball and pump valve system inside the marker keeps the paint flowing and the pigment and binder evenly mixed. Give it a good shake before use for best results. If too much paint comes out, its usually because youre pushing down too hard (or often) on the nib. Its easily fixed - wipe away excess paint, dont pump the nib, and your marker should be good to go again. Dirty nibs can be quickly sorted. If youve got other Liquitex colors or paints on your nib, and theyre still wet, take it out and rinse it. If its dried on or its simply looking a little old and worn out, go for a replacement nib. Theyre easy to fit and return your markers to full precision. Remember to always store markers horizontally and to keep lids on when not in use, to stop the paint drying out. Liquitex intermixability gives you the power to combine any of our paints and mediums, any way you like. Compatible binders let you seamlessly layer, blend and mix all our products with stable, archival results.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Gamblin Neo-Megilp 4 oz Bottle\" COL feature VAL \"GB03504 729911035047 Brand New Item / Unopened Product Gamblin\" COL description VAL \"Neo Megilp is a contemporary version of Maroger.
