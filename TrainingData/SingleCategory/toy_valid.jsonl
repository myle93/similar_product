The consistency of Modelcolor allows for an extremely smooth and uniform paintfilm, with no trace of brushstrokes. Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Mat Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colors may also be diluted with other Mediums for glazes and layered applications. The waterbased formula of Modelcolor has been specifically developed for adherence on difficult surfaces such as metal and plastic, but the product is not toxic, not flammable, and does not give off noxious fumes. Errors can be corrected immediately with water or alcohol Modelcolor dries quickly to a matte, even and waterproof finish. Exact drying time depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment, on the surface which has been painted, and on the thickness of the paint layer - although the colors are dry to the touch within minutes, the water content keeps on evaporating, and the paint does not acquire its true permanence until several weeks after application.

{"ID1": "B007923HS4", "ID2": "B01FNUT3O0", "left": "COL title VAL \"Bachmann Industries Usra 0-6-0 HO Scale #4442 U.P Locomotive, Silver and Black\" COL feature VAL \"DCC ON BOARD locomotive Locomotive backed by Bachmann's exclusive Limited Lifetime Warrantee Preforms best on 18\" radius curves or greater HO Scale  1:87 - Conforms with NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) Standards Featuring Smoke & Operating Headlight Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"This is a brand new HO scale product.

An interactive DVD will test your \"SNL\" knowledge with questions about sketches, impressions, memorable characters and more. Baby boomers and Gen Xers who are stumped by questions in the main edition of Trivial Pursuit may find this SNL Edition right up their alley. This edition follows the premise of the original game, where players roll the die and move around the board answering trivia questions to score a \"wedge\" of a pie. The object is to score a wedge from each of the six category areas to complete the pie and win the game. However, the less dry SNL Edition requires players to answer questions about the Emmy-award winning late-night show <I>Saturday Night Live</I> rather than testing their knowledge of random factoids. Players can choose from eight different playing pieces, which are cleverly shaped as some of the most recognizable comedic characters on the show, such as Molly Shannon playing Mary Katherine Gallagher, Dan Ackroyd as a Conehead, or John Belushi as the Samurai Deli owner. The game includes over 2,000 questions in six different category areas, which includes 450 interactive questions located on the accompanying DVD. This game makes for a hilarious night of reliving favorite sketches, impressions, and mock commercials from this 30-season show. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>\"", "label": 0}

Non-Championship races were often used to test developments on Grand Prix cars and in these early months of 1969 the negatives were yet to outweigh the positive aspects of high mounted aero-wings as the Lotus 49B cars would discover at the Spanish Grand Prix. Bruce McLaren, fellow Antipodean and friend of Brabham, was also running a high wing on his McLaren M7C No.6 car at the Spanish Grand Prix of 1969. During the race boh Lotus 49B cars driven by Graham Hill and Jochen Rindt crashed heavily after the high wings failed. The potential for these wings to fail with a high risk of injury to drivers and spectators was of grave concern and after just a few brief months of an exciting innovative development, such wings were banned by the FIA authorities.

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. DO NOT USE STEEL WOOL TO CLEAN YOUR TRACK. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains.

{"ID1": "B0013K0W6I", "ID2": "B0013K2WWK", "left": "COL title VAL \"Bachmann Trains New Haven 40' Box Car\" COL feature VAL \"Blackened machined-metal wheels with RP25 contours Magnetically operated, body mounted E-Z Mate couplers Non-magnetic, blackened brass axles with needlepoint bearings Celcon trucks Added weight for optimum tracking Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In&#039;. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"NEW YORK, NEW HAVEN & HARTFORD Silver Series(c) rolling stock features: - blackened metal wheels - body mounted couplers - non-magnetic axles WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD - SMALL PARTS!

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In&#039;. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"NEW YORK, NEW HAVEN & HARTFORD Silver Series(c) rolling stock features: - blackened metal wheels - body mounted couplers - non-magnetic axles WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD - SMALL PARTS!

SAFE technology makes helicopter flight more fun Panic recovery mode can prevent a crash. Flybarless rotor mechanical simplicity Durable construction with carbon-fiber components. High-speed coreless main and tail rotor motors (installed) Sub-micro linear long-throw cyclic servos (installed). E-flite 500mAh 1S 3.7V 25C Li-Po flight battery and charger (included) Multi-function transmitter with Spektrum DSMX technology. Refer to the PDF attached below in Technical Specification for User Manual\" COL description VAL \"The original Blade 120 SR heli was specifically designed to provide the inherent stability of a coaxial helicopter and the agile control of a single-rotor helicopter. Modeled after the popular ultra micro-size Blade mSR heli, the larger 120 SR heli was faster and more powerful so it could be flown outdoors. Now that concept takes a leap forward with simpler mechanics and the superiority of SAFE technology so that pilots master the basics of single-rotor flight more easily. The sub-micro Blade 120 S is a great way to graduate from coaxial helis and multirotor drones to a single-rotor machine. Fixed-pitch, flybarless rotor mechanical simplicity lets you enjoy extra speed and agility with a design that has a high-level of durability and efficiency. Exclusive SAFE technology helps keep you in control by delivering the stability you need to develop confidence quickly. Move up to higher levels of flight performance easily with the flip of a transmitter switch. Prevent a crash the second you feel disorientedjust press the Panic Recovery button and SAFE technology locks the 120 S into a familiar level attitude. So whether you aim to advance your skills, or want a fun fly-around heli, the Blade 120 S can help you be the master of single-rotor flight. SAFE Technology: The Blade 120 S features exclusive SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) technology, a revolutionary electronic flight envelope protection system that makes it easy for anyone to fly helicopters with confidence by providing flight mode versatility and Panic Recovery mode that automatically returns the 120 S to a level attitude.  Beginner mode: Small pitch and roll angle limits combined with intuitive self-leveling help you keep the heli under control. Intermediate mode: Pitch and roll limits are expanded to offer a larger flight envelope while intuitive self-leveling continues to provide positive stability. Experienced mode: Limits and leveling are removed to provide full maneuverability. Size Matters: Larger than a micro-class machine, the sub-micro 120 S is great for outdoor flight in low wind, yet it's still small enough that it can be flown in a variety of indoor spaces. Plus, it's practical to have more batteries on hand since the 120 S uses a low-cost 1S Li-Po battery. Durable: The lightweight airframe features durable polymers and carbon-fiber components that deliver mechanical precision and the tolerance to absorb typical mishaps. Flybarless Mechanics:The new flybarless head design offers a higher level of mechanical efficiency as well as a lower parts count which makes helicopter maintenance simpler. Linear Servos: The two 2.9-gram linear long-throw cyclic servos deliver the ideal level of torque and speed for precision and stability that's remarkable for its class. Flight time: The included charger operates from any convenient USB power source. Expect the provided 1S battery to offer average flight times of 5 minutes. Spektrum Technology : The factory-installed 4-in-1 control unit features a Spektrum 2.4GHz DSMX-compatible receiver, main and tail motor ESCs, mixer and flybarless controller. Count on the industry-leading reliability of Spektrum technology to deliver precision control that's ideal for any flying site environment. Multi-Function Transmitter. The RTF includes a Blade 6-channel transmitter with functionality that makes it easy to select SAFE technology flight modes as well as choose high or low dual rate sensitivity. A similar transmitter is required to complete the BNF version.

The Pink Piano stands apart from many other toy pianos in its similarity to full-size pianos. The shape of the piano is very similar to that of a full-size upright, giving children the sense that they are learning just like the grown-ups.

The keys play true notes, just like a real piano, and children will begin to understand the way those keys feel under their little fingers. While learning to strike the keys--first to make sounds and later to make songs!--children start to master their fine motor skills as they exercise each and every finger. The Pink Piano holds two full octaves of keys so children can experiment over a wide range of pitch. There is also a multicolored guide along the keys that labels each key with its corresponding note. This key guide corresponds with the included Songbook for the Beginning Musician, teaching children to learn such well-known songs as \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" with ease. Started in the garage at Doug's parents' house in 1988, Melissa &amp; Doug has become one of the most popular toy makers in the world. Its toys have garnered dozens of awards and have been widely featured in national media. Melissa &amp; Doug toys meet all US consumer product safety regulations. The toys are tested at the factory of origin during various phases of the production process to ensure they meet the company's stringent safety requirements. In particular, the paints and coatings on Melissa &amp; Doug toys are tested frequently to meet or exceed government recommendations limiting heavy metals and lead in children's items.

Locomotive backed by Bachmanns exclusive Limited Lifetime Warrantee HO Scale  1:87 -- Conforms with NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) Standards Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal Rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal  Rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal  Rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, UNPLUG THE POWER SUPPLY IMMEDIATELY. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"This is the HO Scale DCC Sound Canadian National Alco FA2 Diesel Locomotive by Bachmann CANADIAN NATIONAL HO Scale AlcoFA2 Diesel Locomotive - DCC Sound Value On Board.

Just be careful not to use make-up that contains mineral oil. The best make-up to use is called RMG, rubber mask grease paint. You can attach these ears with spirit gum (our recommendation) or liquid latex. The edge seams can be blended in with latex, or hidden with the use of an ear cuff as shown in the picture. <b>The ears pictured are painted to match a fair skintone.</b> Because our ears are made from molds, they may not be a perfect fit for you. We like to say that our ears are one size fits most. Some styles fit smaller ears better, some fit larger ears better.

Roll up your sleeves and find out about fuel cells, solar cells, and electrolysis through more than a dozen experiments and demonstrations you can do on your own, in a classroom, or with friends. Some fuel cells, such as this one, do not consume fossil fuels. Recently redesigned, this 10th Anniversary Edition includes a completely redesigned car, millimeter, solar panel, and manual. The kit also comes with a rolling display stand and a battery pack. The full-color, 64-page manual is a comprehensive lesson in solar cells and fuel cells.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Solar Dancing Turkey\" COL feature VAL \"Dances when placed in a sunny or brightly lit spot!

An interactive DVD will test your \"SNL\" knowledge with questions about sketches, impressions, memorable characters and more. Baby boomers and Gen Xers who are stumped by questions in the main edition of Trivial Pursuit may find this SNL Edition right up their alley. This edition follows the premise of the original game, where players roll the die and move around the board answering trivia questions to score a \"wedge\" of a pie. The object is to score a wedge from each of the six category areas to complete the pie and win the game. However, the less dry SNL Edition requires players to answer questions about the Emmy-award winning late-night show <I>Saturday Night Live</I> rather than testing their knowledge of random factoids. Players can choose from eight different playing pieces, which are cleverly shaped as some of the most recognizable comedic characters on the show, such as Molly Shannon playing Mary Katherine Gallagher, Dan Ackroyd as a Conehead, or John Belushi as the Samurai Deli owner. The game includes over 2,000 questions in six different category areas, which includes 450 interactive questions located on the accompanying DVD.

If they choose a swan, for example, they unleash Elsa's ice powers to write the letter 'S' in the sky, and then transform it into a sparkling swan sculpture. This gives them practice with handwriting and reinforces phonics skills. Children can then adorn their sculpture with flowers by joining Olaf in a spelling mini-game. Children are asked to build smaller words such as \"all\" and \"now\" from the letters in a bigger story-based word, such as \"snowball.\" Flowers grow to reward each word they find. Once they've gathered enough flowers, children can help Olaf arrange the words on each bouquet into sentences, then use the bouquets to decorate their ice sculpture.\"", "label": 0}

Canadian 4-Bay Cylindrical Grain Hopper Santa Fe - N Scale\" COL feature VAL \"Rolling Stock for your N Scale layout All Metal Wheels, RP25 NMRA wheel contours Highly Detailed N Scale Car 1: 160 Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"Rolling stock features: blackened metal wheels, and E-Z Mate Mark II magnetically operated knuckle couplers.

Approximately 6 inches in length and 8 inches wingspan. Plastic stand included.\" COL description VAL \"This posting is for one Sopwith Camel F.1 biplane Model kit from NewRay. This collection is made in the 1/48 scale which translates to approximate sizes, depending on model, of 7 inches in length with a wingspan of about 9 inches. Like other NewRay building kit, they are not your typical building kit where one needs to cut pieces out of runners/trees and glue them together, but instead they come as disassembled toys where one needs to attach the engines to the front of the fuselage and then the wings to the fuselage and connecting rods. All the screws, connecting rods and little screw driver are included in the box. No gluing or painting is needed as they are snap fit models. Markings and different color trims are present in some models and accurately done. This collection in particular is very nice looking because of the bright colors. From the photos (and more in person) one can appreciate that the paint is thik and the finish is glossy. The Sopwith Camel F.1 is the only model that comes in its \"natural\" color, meaning the plastic is made in the model's color. The other models are coated with colored paint which is why they look so good. One has to handle the models in order to confirm that they are indeed made of plastic and not metal. However, this nice finish and coloring comes with a small disadvantage, which is that the paint can crack and flake if pieces are forced together or screwed improperly. Other nice details are the different and accurate machine guns, exhaust ports, engines, free rolling wheels, colored hubs and smooth spinning propellers (which can turn/rotate if you blow on them). Also the models are constructed in a way that the vertical stabilizer (tail) is movable and pivots side to side.
