The HydroStop replaces flimsy rubber flappers with a sturdy tower and is engineered to eliminate the most common toilet problems. Unlike the angled, floating close of a flapper, the HydroStop drops vertically and solidly onto the flush valve opening to create a better seal and eliminate leaks. The EPA estimates that 20% of all toilets leak up to 200 gallons of water a day, mostly because of faulty flappers. While ordinary flappers are connected to the handle with a thin chain that is subject to improper tension tangles and breakage, the HydroStop features a durable stainless steel cable that is stronger, lasts longer and is less likely to break. The HydroStop also features patented S.T.O.P. Technology (Safe Toilet Overflow Protection) that helps prevent bowl overflows. In the event of a clog, lifting up on the handle immediately drops the HydroStop tower and closes the flush valve so that water does not continue to drain from the tank into the bowl.

Once 34ppm is reached, the LED blinks red and an audible alarm alerts the user to the potential danger. CO is a lethal poison produced when certain fuels are burned. It can rapidly accumulate even in areas that might appear well ventilated. Because CO is colorless, tasteless, odorless and non-irritating, and can overcome an exposed person without warning. Recognizing early warning signs of CO poisoning is sometimes difficult because early symptoms of CO exposure (headache, dizziness, nausea) are nonspecific and may be mistaken for symptoms of other illnesses and frequently produce weakness and confusion, depriving a person of the ability to seek safety.

Can be used all paints and stains. Shur-Line invented the first paint roller with a removable cover in 1945 and our-years of experience have paved the way for do-it-yourselfers and professional painters to achieve flawless paint application. Shur-Line's patented technologies continue to set the standard for quality paint rollers. Shur-Line invented the advanced technology of our thermo-bond process in which the roller cover fabric is thermally fused to the core. This eliminates adhesive failure associated with traditional cardboard and pvc plastic cores. Thermo-bond cores are tough and impervious to paint solvents and water. This results in roller covers that are virtually indestructible and roll smoothly every time. Shur-Line's proprietary fabrics use the proper fiber crimping for optimum painting performance. Knit fabric rollers can be used for the majority of jobs and rollers made with woven fabrics provide the smoothest finish for specialized applications. All Shur-Line rollers undergo an advanced finishing process that results in low linting and leaves a uniform paint finish.

No neutral or ground wires required for installation Single Pole or 3-way when used with a 3-way switch Comes packaged with 3 changeable color faces; white, ivory, and light almond Five-year limited warranty\" COL description VAL \"Delivers maximum energy savings by combining the functionality of a sensor with the versatility and ambiance control of a dimmer. Leviton's IPVD6 Dimming Vacancy Sensor requires the user to manually turn the lights ON when you enter a room but the lights will automatically turn OFF when you leave. It also allows the user to easily adjust the light level in a room from very low to full brightness when using dimmable LED, dimmable CFL, incandescent or halogen bulbs. Very convenient in high traffic areas such as hallways, childrens rooms, living rooms, dining rooms and bathrooms where the light level can be dimmed or brightened based on the activity, but ensure that the lights are not left ON unnecessarily for hours at a time. It uses \"passive infrared technology\" which responds to the infrared heat people naturally emit to monitor a specific area. When this \"heat\" is sensed, the lights will stay ON in the room. When you leave the room and this heat is no longer sensed the lights will automatically turn OFF. Features time delay settings of 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 15 minutes or 30 minutes for automatic OFF. For example, closet lighting would ideally be set to turn off in 5 minutes while a bathroom fan may be set to turn off 15 minutes after the space is vacated. Leviton vacancy sensors are a simple, cost effective way to automate a space in your home. Compatible with Decora screwless snap-on wallplates (sold separately). <div class=\"aplus\"> Leviton&rsquo;s new cutting-edge IPVD6 universal dimming vacancy sensor offers the convenience of a motion sensor as well as the flexible ambience controls of a dimmer to increase energy and costs savings while still enabling users to choose the light level that&rsquo;s right for the occasion. <table cellpadding=\"12\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" align=\"right\"><tr><td><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"230\" align=\"center\"><tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/factbox_leviton._V138446943_.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"At a Glance\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background: url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/a-plus_middle-217._V180545590_.gif) repeat-y\"><table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"215\" align=\"left\"><tr><td><center><b>Universal Dimming Vacancy Sensor<br>At A Glance:</b></center><br><ul><li>Compatible with dimmable LED and CFL bulbs, as well as incandescent bulbs<br><br></li><li>Manual on, automatic off switching is perfect for hallways and high-traffic areas<br><br></li><li>Single pole or 3-way lighting control (when used with a 3-way switch)<br><br></li><li>Four timing options for automatic shutoff, from 30 seconds to 30 minutes<br><br></li><li>Enhanced starting technology for CFL bulbs<br><br></li></ul></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/a-plus_bottom-217._V180545591_.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"At a Glance\"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table><table cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"240\" align=\"left\"><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/LLargeI._V390292545_.jpg\" onClick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=785'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/LThumbI._V390292544_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Leviton Universal Dimming Vacancy Sensor\"></a><br><font size=\"1\"><em><b>Leviton's universal dimming vacancy sensor combines the ambiance control of a dimmer with the energy savings of a vacancy sensor (click to enlarge).</b></em></font></td></tr></table> <b>Wide Compatibility and Convenient Setting Memory</b></br>The universal dimming vacancy sensor allows users easily to modify lighting levels of incandescent bulbs as well as newly emerging dimmable LED and dimmable CFL bulbs. To enhance performance with dimmable CFL bulbs, the dimming vacancy sensor features enhanced starting technology specifically for CFL bulbs. For added convenience, the sensor retains the last dimmer setting that was used before the lights turned off, meaning there is no need to reset the dimming level unless the user desires. <br><br> With its unobtrusive design and included color change kit (offering white, ivory, and light almond), the universal dimming vacancy sensor complements nearly every d&eacute;cor. The IPVD6 utilizes a 180-degree field of view that covers 900 square feet&mdash;broad enough to track motion in nearly any room. Using passive infrared detection technology, the segmented lens divides the field of view into sensor zones. To balance energy savings and convenience, the sensor can be set to turn off the lights after either thirty seconds, five minutes, fifteen minutes, or thirty minutes of vacancy in an area. </br> </br><b>Two Ways to Save Energy</b></br>Leviton&rsquo;s universal dimming vacancy sensor helps save energy (and money) in two ways. First, when the sensor ceases to detect motion in an area, it automatically switches the lights off.

We provide stylish design-oriented innovative home solutions that are user-friendly to support and encourage customers to tackle home improvement tasks on their own - without the heavy price tag of professional services. The HydroStop replaces flimsy rubber flappers with a sturdy tower and is engineered to eliminate the most common toilet problems. Unlike the angled, floating close of a flapper, the HydroStop drops vertically and solidly onto the flush valve opening to create a better seal and eliminate leaks. The EPA estimates that 20% of all toilets leak up to 200 gallons of water a day, mostly because of faulty flappers. While ordinary flappers are connected to the handle with a thin chain that is subject to improper tension tangles and breakage, the HydroStop features a durable stainless steel cable that is stronger, lasts longer and is less likely to break. The HydroStop also features patented S.T.O.P. Technology (Safe Toilet Overflow Protection) that helps prevent bowl overflows. In the event of a clog, lifting up on the handle immediately drops the HydroStop tower and closes the flush valve so that water does not continue to drain from the tank into the bowl.

The HydroStop replaces flimsy rubber flappers with a sturdy tower and is engineered to eliminate the most common toilet problems. Unlike the angled, floating close of a flapper, the HydroStop drops vertically and solidly onto the flush valve opening to create a better seal and eliminate leaks. The EPA estimates that 20% of all toilets leak up to 200 gallons of water a day, mostly because of faulty flappers. While ordinary flappers are connected to the handle with a thin chain that is subject to improper tension tangles and breakage, the HydroStop features a durable stainless steel cable that is stronger, lasts longer and is less likely to break. The HydroStop also features patented S.T.O.P. Technology (Safe Toilet Overflow Protection) that helps prevent bowl overflows. In the event of a clog, lifting up on the handle immediately drops the HydroStop tower and closes the flush valve so that water does not continue to drain from the tank into the bowl.

Which is really a big deal. Since select GE Disposal disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposall disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposall offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction.

Leviton's IPVD6 Dimming Vacancy Sensor requires the user to manually turn the lights ON when you enter a room but the lights will automatically turn OFF when you leave. It also allows the user to easily adjust the light level in a room from very low to full brightness when using dimmable LED, dimmable CFL, incandescent or halogen bulbs. Very convenient in high traffic areas such as hallways, childrens rooms, living rooms, dining rooms and bathrooms where the light level can be dimmed or brightened based on the activity, but ensure that the lights are not left ON unnecessarily for hours at a time. It uses \"passive infrared technology\" which responds to the infrared heat people naturally emit to monitor a specific area. When this \"heat\" is sensed, the lights will stay ON in the room. When you leave the room and this heat is no longer sensed the lights will automatically turn OFF. Features time delay settings of 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 15 minutes or 30 minutes for automatic OFF. For example, closet lighting would ideally be set to turn off in 5 minutes while a bathroom fan may be set to turn off 15 minutes after the space is vacated. Leviton vacancy sensors are a simple, cost effective way to automate a space in your home. Compatible with Decora screwless snap-on wallplates (sold separately). <div class=\"aplus\"> Leviton&rsquo;s new cutting-edge IPVD6 universal dimming vacancy sensor offers the convenience of a motion sensor as well as the flexible ambience controls of a dimmer to increase energy and costs savings while still enabling users to choose the light level that&rsquo;s right for the occasion. <table cellpadding=\"12\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"220\" align=\"right\"><tr><td><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"230\" align=\"center\"><tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/factbox_leviton._V138446943_.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"At a Glance\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background: url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/a-plus_middle-217._V180545590_.gif) repeat-y\"><table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"215\" align=\"left\"><tr><td><center><b>Universal Dimming Vacancy Sensor<br>At A Glance:</b></center><br><ul><li>Compatible with dimmable LED and CFL bulbs, as well as incandescent bulbs<br><br></li><li>Manual on, automatic off switching is perfect for hallways and high-traffic areas<br><br></li><li>Single pole or 3-way lighting control (when used with a 3-way switch)<br><br></li><li>Four timing options for automatic shutoff, from 30 seconds to 30 minutes<br><br></li><li>Enhanced starting technology for CFL bulbs<br><br></li></ul></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/a-plus_bottom-217._V180545591_.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"At a Glance\"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table><table cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"240\" align=\"left\"><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/LLargeI._V390292545_.jpg\" onClick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=785'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/LThumbI._V390292544_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Leviton Universal Dimming Vacancy Sensor\"></a><br><font size=\"1\"><em><b>Leviton's universal dimming vacancy sensor combines the ambiance control of a dimmer with the energy savings of a vacancy sensor (click to enlarge).</b></em></font></td></tr></table> <b>Wide Compatibility and Convenient Setting Memory</b></br>The universal dimming vacancy sensor allows users easily to modify lighting levels of incandescent bulbs as well as newly emerging dimmable LED and dimmable CFL bulbs. To enhance performance with dimmable CFL bulbs, the dimming vacancy sensor features enhanced starting technology specifically for CFL bulbs. For added convenience, the sensor retains the last dimmer setting that was used before the lights turned off, meaning there is no need to reset the dimming level unless the user desires. <br><br> With its unobtrusive design and included color change kit (offering white, ivory, and light almond), the universal dimming vacancy sensor complements nearly every d&eacute;cor. The IPVD6 utilizes a 180-degree field of view that covers 900 square feet&mdash;broad enough to track motion in nearly any room. Using passive infrared detection technology, the segmented lens divides the field of view into sensor zones. To balance energy savings and convenience, the sensor can be set to turn off the lights after either thirty seconds, five minutes, fifteen minutes, or thirty minutes of vacancy in an area. </br> </br><b>Two Ways to Save Energy</b></br>Leviton&rsquo;s universal dimming vacancy sensor helps save energy (and money) in two ways. First, when the sensor ceases to detect motion in an area, it automatically switches the lights off. Secondly, the dimming function allows users to customize lighting levels according to the activity in the room. The IPVD6 is perfect for high-traffic areas like hallways, living rooms, kids&rsquo; rooms, and rumpus rooms&mdash;anywhere people or pets pass through frequently. In such high-traffic areas, users often prefer to turn lights on manually when needed, but want to make sure the lights turn off when the areas are vacated. </br> Backed by over a hundred years of quality Leviton engineering, the IPVD6 features a limited five-year product warranty, and is California Title 20 compliant (meets California Code of Regulation Title 20, required after February 1, 2013).</br></br> <b>What's in the Box?</b><br>One Leviton IRVD6 universal dimming vacancy sensor, packaged with white, ivory, and light almond color options. </br> <table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"500\"><tr align=\"center\"><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/BThumbI._V390292547_.jpg\" onClick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=825,height=629'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/BThumbI._V390292547_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Leviton Universal Dimming Vacancy Sensor\"></a></td><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/BLargeII._V390292544_.jpg\" onClick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=701,height=561'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/DimmingOcc/BthumbII._V390292545_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Leviton Universal Dimming Vacancy Sensor\"></a></td><tr align=\"center\"><td colspan=\"3\"><font size=\"1\"><em><b>With a 180-degree field of view covering 900 square feet, the universal dimming vacancy sensor is perfect for any room where users want the lights to turn off after the room becomes vacant (click each to enlarge).</b></em></font></td></tr></table> <div align=\"center\"> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/7-10_sensors-chart._V379525422_.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/leviton/7-10_sensors-chart._V379525422_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Leviton Sensor Chart\"> </a> </div> </div>\"", "label": 0}

It is ideal for users who need a more adaptable, effective, and convenient tool for daily use. It is perfect for any jobsite or workshop with an easy-to-use one button operation feature.

This laser is multipurpose, making it ideal for tradesmen who work a variety of jobs involving squaring, plumbing, and leveling where a multifunction tool is required. If you are an electrician, plumber, kitchen installer, framer, drywaller, or general contractor, this is the laser for you. It can be used for a variety of applications, including transferring points to the ceiling or lighting installations using plumb points or square a room for partition or walls. This measuring tool has a standard 1-year warranty if it is not registered. If you register the tool within 8 months of purchase, the warranty is extended to 2 years. The GCL 25 laser by Bosch has five different points that offer solutions across the most common applications. The applications it is built to examine include: horizontal leveling, vertical leveling, squaring, plumb transfer, and layout. The best part about this tool&rsquo;s versatility across common applications is that you no longer have to pack two lasers to the jobsite or off-site project, because you have the combined power of two-in-one. This laser saves you time, money, and space with the simple switch of a button. The Bosch GCL 25 laser incorporates several special features to increase both the performance and user ease of the tool. Located conveniently on the exterior of the tool is the on/off sliding button, LED battery status, and line/point selection keypad. The on/off sliding button features a pendulum lock function and is easy to reach. It has three different levels that are: the laser is on and in self-leveling mode, the laser is on but self-leveling is off, or the laser is off. The LED battery status is located on top of the tool for added user convenience so that you don&rsquo;t have to go looking for the current battery status. In addition, this laser is ergonomically designed for a comfortable and solid grip. On the interior of the tool are the tripod thread, self-leveler, and accuracy feature. The tripod thread measures at 1/4-inch and 5/8-inch. The self-leveling feature measures within 4-degrees. The accuracy feature allows for accuracy within 1/8-inch on horizontal points, 9/16-inches on vertical points, and 1/8-inch on cross-line. The points are also visible for up to 100-feet, and the lines respectively up to 33-feet. This laser is also protected against dust and splash water with ingress protection 54 (IP 54). The keypad is controlled by how many times you press the keypad. When the pendulum is unlocked and the laser has self-leveling on, the different levels are: default mode where you will have cross-lines (turning it on), 5 point mode (first press of keypad), horizontal line only (second press of keypad), vertical line only (third press of keypad), and return to default mode (fourth press of keypad). When the pendulum is locked (slope mode) and the laser has self-leveling off, the different levels are: cross-line mode (default mode), horizontal line (first press of keypad), vertical line (second press of keypad), or back to default (third press of keypad). Please note that when you are in slope mode, the points are used to plumb and align partitions based on their 90-degree angle to each other. The important precondition for these applications is to have the points leveled. Using the points in non-self-leveling mode may lead to an error. To avoid this error, only the lines are activated for the leveling applications when the laser is in slop mode. This GCL 25 laser is outstanding in comparison to the GPL2, GPL3, or CPL5. To begin, it out numbers the other models by featuring a cross-line in addition to five laser dots. It also has a plumb range of 15-feet, a horizontal point range of 100-feet, and a lines range of 30-feet. The accuracy is unique to the GCL25 of within 1/8-inch at 30-feet. The self-leveling within 4-degrees is also only a feature you will get with this laser. It is also not limited to basic applications, covering plumbing, horizontal leveling, squaring, and versatile alignment. It also has the ability to set right angles. This kit includes one GCL 25 bare tool combination laser, 4 AA batteries, a target plane, carrying point, and carton box.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Bosch 360-Degree Self-Leveling Cross-Line Laser GLL 2-20\" COL feature VAL \"VISIBILITY: Features Boschs Visimax technology to deliver maximum line laser visibility up to 65 feet in standard working conditions 360 DEGREE: Provides four-mode functionality, including single vertical, single horizontal, horizontal/vertical combination and lock/manual modes.

Which is really a big deal. Since select GE Disposal disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposall disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposall offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposall has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs. All our models operate quietly and some even offer sound reduction technology. The sound reduction package includes a fully insulated sound shell, so our disposers can handle your toughest challenges while minimizing noise. Did you know that Americans throw away nearly 25 percent of all food prepared? And decomposing waste in landfills is one of the largest producers of methane gas, which is the main contributor of global warming?

The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system. Even more, the food-waste disposal features sound-reduction technology that helps ensure quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen. Thoughtfully constructed, the food-waste disposal system also provides a two-level precutter, an on/off wall-switch with a sink stopper, a manual-reset overload protector, and a splashguard, as well as stainless-steel, jam-resistant, dual swivel impellers. Other highlights include cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material, a stainless-steel sink flange, and a stainless-steel turntable. To operate, simply remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, flip the switch to ON, and scrape in the food waste. The continuous-feed disposal takes care of the rest. Before turning the disposal off, let the water and the disposal run for about 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain. The food-waste disposal measures 7.75 inches in diameter by 13.44 inches high.

Full Port Valve comes with a water tight cap Read more\" COL description VAL \"If you have smelly hot water this rod is for you!! The zinc in this anode rod is designed to combat odor that comes from your hot water tank. Often times when well water is used H2S builds up causing a rotten egg smell to come from your hot water. Zinc counteracts this natural process and eliminates the unwanted odor. This is the Outlet Fitting model of the Blue Lightning Aluminum Flexible Anode Rod combined with the Drainage Kit. This model has a length of 42 inches, a diameter of .75 inches, and 3/4-14 NPT thread size (This sizing should be standard for the bulk of residential water heaters). The rod is broken down into four separate segments. Each segment is Aluminum on a steal rod core. The segments are attached via copper or stainless steel couplers and 301 stainless steel braided wire. All of our Anode Rods are lead free! The Drainage kit comes with a Full Port Brass Valve that provides a 3/4 inch connection compatible with your average garden hose. This provides a method for easily draining your water heater annually to reduce sediment build-up. This valve also provides an opening large enough for a long narrow object to breakup any hardened material that has collected at the bottom of the tank. The Full Port Valve comes with a water tight cap so that you can easily secure the connection when not in use. Together these items can significantly extend the life span of your water heater by preventing damage to the interior of the tank. Our innovatively designed Blue Lightning Aluminum Flexible Rod, also known as a sacrificial rod, is designed to attract the corrosive properties in your water heater tank and break down before the steel interior of the water heater through a process called electrolysis. In many cases, particularly when an aluminium anode rod was used previously, the rod slowly deteriorates and falls to the bottom of the water heater creating a destructive sludge. If this sludge is left unattended it can cause drainage valve blockage.\"", "label": 0}

Which is really a big deal. Since select GE Disposal disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposall disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposall offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposall has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs. All our models operate quietly and some even offer sound reduction technology. The sound reduction package includes a fully insulated sound shell, so our disposers can handle your toughest challenges while minimizing noise.

The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system. Even more, the food-waste disposal features sound-reduction technology that helps ensure quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen. Thoughtfully constructed, the food-waste disposal system also provides a two-level precutter, an on/off wall-switch with a sink stopper, a manual-reset overload protector, and a splashguard, as well as stainless-steel, jam-resistant, dual swivel impellers. Other highlights include cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material, a stainless-steel sink flange, and a stainless-steel turntable. To operate, simply remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, flip the switch to ON, and scrape in the food waste. The continuous-feed disposal takes care of the rest. Before turning the disposal off, let the water and the disposal run for about 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain.

The DW089K is ideal for professionals tasked with residential and commercial applications such as installing cabinets, drop ceilings, chair rails or doors and windows. Unlike many line lasers on the market, the DW089K features a second plumb line that forms a 90-Degree intersecting line on the floor and ceiling. This third vertical beam allows contractors to use the tool for layout applications without the need for a second laser, saving time and allowing users to be as productive as possible. For commercial wall layout applications, the DW089K has a track clearance of over 1-3/4-Inch, which means there is no need for additional accessories to raise the laser over drywall track. This Line Laser also has a micro adjust knob for easy alignment, a metal roll cage for durability, and an integrated pivot bracket and universal wall mount that is ideal for acoustical ceiling installation. The micro adjust knob is especially important in that it allows users to steadily adjust the 90-Degree layout lines in small increments without the need to nudge the laser to hit a specific mark. For improved visibility, the beam on the DW089K is two-times brighter than the beam on DEWALT's current line laser. The brighter beam provides increased visibility over long distances as well as in direct sunlight. Accurate within 1/8 of an inch at 30-Feet, the DW089K allows contractors to feel confident in their results when using this product. To alleviate the difficulty professionals often experience when they try to access control panels on the rear of existing units. This is a Class 2 laser product, Power output  1.5mW. 3 Year Warranty\"", "label": 0}

Connect argon gas through the argon gas pressure reducing valve; adjust the gas pressure reading to the minimum 3. Tungsten needle can be sharpened by grinding on the grinding wheel, or with the use of a Fordham flex shaft or dremal tool and an abrasive disk. Note that you should not use a wheel previously used to grind iron/steel as this will contaminate the needle and cause an uneven spark and/or weld results. 4. When installing the tungsten needle, please insure that the needle is approximately 5mm out from the welding head. The diameter of needle should be 0.1mm. Operation steps 1. Plug the device into the wall socket and turn it on 2. Adjust input current by adjusting the current regulating dial to 1-1.5 to start. The current regulating dial ranges from 1-8. The dial can be adjusted as necessary depending upon the current flow that gives best results for your target material. 3. Check that gas is flowing over the tungsten tip with your finger. Adjust Argon gas until you can just feel the flow. 4. Clamp the object to be welded with the negative ground electrode. You cannot short circuit the machine by having both the tungsten needle and the ground clamp in contact through the work piece at the same time. Do not have the target work piece in direct contact with the tungsten needle. A 0.5mm arc gap is necessary for pulse welder operation. This is the optimum distance for welding. 5. Insure you have arc welding eye protection in place. The arc emits short wave UV radiation that will cause eye retinal burns and skin burns. Cover exposed skin (a shirt is fine), wear gloves and use an arc welding helmet. 6. Briefly step on the foot pedal and release. The arc will have pulsed and spot welded at the point you had the tungsten electrode.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Smith Little Torch Acetylene Mapp Heating Tip #13-662\" COL feature VAL \"13-662\" COL description VAL \"Smith Equipment Heating Tip # 13-662 Little Torch These Smith Little Torch heating tips are NEW and never used.&nbsp; They fit the Smith Little Torch handle.

It also comes with a carrying pouch to help protect it from the rough realities of construction work. For your convenience, the PLS3 can run for more than 30 hours on three standard AA-sized batteries (included). All PLS tools are designed and manufactured to meet strict quality control guidelines, and the PLS3 is backed by a three-year limited warranty. As a construction professional, you know exactly how time consuming and tricky to master bubble vial levels, plumb-bob setups, and complicated rotary lasers can be. Developed by contractors to help you work more efficiently, the PLS3 point-to-point laser is precise, portable, and simple to use, making it ideal for everything from installing fixtures, doors, and windows to HVAC and electrical work. The PLS3 features three bright, easy-to-see beams, which lets you quickly trace plumb lines from floor to ceiling or from 50 feet off the ground. A strong performer indoors and outdoors, the PLS3 offers a visible indoor working range of 300 feet and a visible outdoor working range of 60 feet. It is accurate within 1/4 inch at 100 feet, and its intuitive design includes a cantilevered nose that makes it easy to see the laser's down beam over two-by-fours, metal tracks, and plates. This is the tool of choice for contractors looking for a laser plumb bob. To help ensure accuracy, if the tool's self-leveling range is exceeded, the beam shuts off automatically to alert you. No pendulum target. Like all PLS point-and-line laser alignment tools, the PLS3 is fully self-leveling, and it takes full advantage of the patented PLS pendulum design and magnetic dampening to deliver real, usable results. Dampening is the settling down effect on the laser beam, and thanks to this advanced technology, all PLS point and line lasers settle down instantly when moved to a new layout point. Additionally, this system compensates for job site vibrations caused by compressors, generators, and other heavy equipment, preventing the laser point from \"jumping\" around and ensuring that your laser delivers accurate, usable information. This helps your team get jobs done right the first time to save you time and money. PLS has upgraded its warranty from a single year to a three-year limited warranty. During this warranty period, your PLS product will be repaired or replaced (with the same or similar model at our option), without charge for either parts or labor, through PLS. If your laser tool ever does need to be serviced, PLS offers fast, 48-hour factory turnaround on repairs or replacements to help ensure that your PLS laser line tool continues to provide accurate performance and improved productivity for the full duration of your career. Built by contractors for contractors, PLS tools were developed out of necessity by professional carpenters with over 50 years of experience in commercial and residential interior and exterior layout, and they're recognized as some of the finest point-to-point and reference line layout tools in the world. Ideal for installing curtain walls, foundations, columns, skylights, doors, cabinetry, and much more, PLS tools combine portability with advanced, utilitarian designs for effective use in situations where traditional bubble vial levels or two-person plumb bob setups are too cumbersome or too limited to get the job done right.

The Survival Tabs have such a highly concentrated formula that 99% of their calorie content is absorbed by the body with 97% of the protein content being available to repair or replacement of muscles, nerves, etc. <b>SHELF LIFE AND SUSTAINABILITY</b> We have samples of The Survival Tabs that were produced in 1974-75. They have been stored at room temperature. We test them periodically and have found little, if any, deterioration or loss of vitamin or food value. Our results showed negligible loss in these areas. Freezing temperatures will have no effect at all on these tablets.We would estimate the shelf-life for The Survival Tabs to be 25 years, but suggest rotating them to ensure maximum food value every 2-3 years. <b>NUTRITION</b>\"", "label": 0}

The BRK hardwire carbon monoxide detects dangerous CO gas and allows you peace of mind with its battery backup. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, deadly gas. It can be emitted by sources including gas or oil furnaces, gas clothes dryers, water heaters, fireplaces, wood stoves, charcoal grills, gas ranges, and space heaters. A clogged chimney, improper venting, and attached garages can also cause carbon monoxide accumulation. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), at least one CO alarm should be installed near a home's sleeping area. This alarm's digital display with peak memory remembers and displays the highest CO levels detected. The BRK CO5120PDBN hardwire CO alarm with battery backup and digital display includes these features: <ul> <li>Quick plug-in power connector for easy installation. <li>120-volt AC inter-connectable (with maximum 18 compatible devices). The alarm can be interconnected with up to 12 other compatible smoke alarms and six compatible devices like bells, horns, repeaters and door closers. If one unit triggers an alarm, all smoke alarms in the series will sound. Power indicators show which unit in the series initiated the alarm. <li>Digital display shows elevated levels of CO (in parts per million) present in the air. <li>Microprocessor controlled for fewer nuisance alarms. <li> Single test/silence button which both silences a non-threatening alarm or low battery warning and allows you to test the unit's functionality. <li>Latching alarm indicator which automatically identifies which unit initiated the alarm. <li>Battery drawer lock and mounting bracket lock for tamper resistance. <li>AC power indicator and alarm indicator light. <li>Low battery warning \"chirp\" and missing battery tab. <li>9-volt battery backup for peace of mind during power outages. </ul> All BRK Electronics carbon monoxide alarms are listed to UL Safety Standard 2034 for residential carbon monoxide alarms. Includes 9-volt backup battery. 5-year limited warranty.

Which is really a big deal. Since select GE Disposal disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposall disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposall offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposall easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposall was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposall has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs. All our models operate quietly and some even offer sound reduction technology. The sound reduction package includes a fully insulated sound shell, so our disposers can handle your toughest challenges while minimizing noise. Did you know that Americans throw away nearly 25 percent of all food prepared? And decomposing waste in landfills is one of the largest producers of methane gas, which is the main contributor of global warming?

The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system. Even more, the food-waste disposal features sound-reduction technology that helps ensure quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen. Thoughtfully constructed, the food-waste disposal system also provides a two-level precutter, an on/off wall-switch with a sink stopper, a manual-reset overload protector, and a splashguard, as well as stainless-steel, jam-resistant, dual swivel impellers. Other highlights include cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material, a stainless-steel sink flange, and a stainless-steel turntable. To operate, simply remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, flip the switch to ON, and scrape in the food waste. The continuous-feed disposal takes care of the rest. Before turning the disposal off, let the water and the disposal run for about 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain.

Complete with the latest technology in density detecting software and circuitry, an ergonomic body design, and an erasable marking system. Unlike other wall sensors, scanners and stud finders, the MS 740 is uniquely designed with a \"floating head\" that keeps the scanning surface level on textured or rough surfaces so results are more accurate. The 4-mode switch makes it easy to change functions while the ultra-bright display screen, dual SpotLite Pointing System, and audio tone all indicate the location of the target. The Signal Strength Indicator helps to distinguish between shallow and deep targets. The MultiScanner 740 also includes ACT (Auto Correcting Technology) that automatically corrects common user errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud, in addition to a low battery indicator to alert its users to replace its battery for optimal performance results. In StudScan mode, the multifunctional 740 locates the center, edges, and direction of wood or metal studs up to 3/4 of an inch (19 mm) deep. Switch over to DeepScan mode and double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm). Metal Scan mode of the MS740 provides the ability to locate non-ferrous metal, such as copper pipes, up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep and ferrous metal, such as rebar, up to 3 inches (75 mm) deep. Using Metal Scan mode, studs can be found behind lath and plaster walls, tile, drywall and stucco walls by identifying the consistent pattern of screw or nail heads in the studs. Additionally, the MS 740 is programmed with a WireWarning Detection feature that indicates the presence of live unshielded electrical wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep when using the stud and metal scan modes. To detect, locate, map, and trace the live wires, simply switch over to the AC Scan function which finds and traces live, unshielded AC wiring up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. Then use the integrated, erasable marker to note the progression of the wires, studs, or other objects behind the walls.

The Survival Tabs have such a highly concentrated formula that 99% of their calorie content is absorbed by the body with 97% of the protein content being available to repair or replacement of muscles, nerves, etc. <b>SHELF LIFE AND SUSTAINABILITY</b> We have samples of The Survival Tabs that were produced in 1974-75. They have been stored at room temperature. We test them periodically and have found little, if any, deterioration or loss of vitamin or food value. Our results showed negligible loss in these areas. Freezing temperatures will have no effect at all on these tablets.We would estimate the shelf-life for The Survival Tabs to be 25 years, but suggest rotating them to ensure maximum food value every 2-3 years. <b>NUTRITION</b>\"", "label": 0}

Automotive: Used in older-model cars, glass tube fuses today are found primarily in automotive accessory applications. Appliances & Consumer Electronics: Glass and ceramic tube fuses are often used to protect appliances and consumer electronics. As electronic equipment becomes smaller, the circuits and components become more delicate and easily damaged. Fuses are the preferred method of protection due to their accuracy, small size and reliability. Fuses are available in a wide variety of amp ratings to provide precise protection. Generally, two sizes of user-replaceable fuses are found: the 1/4-Inch x 1-1/4-Inch and 5mm x 20mm. Each is available in a variety of volt and amp ratings. There are two basic types of fuses available for appliances and consumer electronics: fast-acting or time-delay. Any replacement fuse must match the one it's replacing. In general, fast-acting fuses are a single strand of wire or strip of metal. Time-delay fuses usually have a coiled wire, a thick element wrapped in wire, or a spring. Most electronic fuses will have the voltage and amp rating stamped on the end cap. The type of fuse can generally be visually identified. Also, owner's manuals will have the correct replacement fuse generically identified. For example: \"Use a 2 amp, time-delay, 250 volt fuse.\" Glass and ceramic tube fuses vary by diameter and length. This fuse is 5mm diameter and 20mm long.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Siemens BQ2B100L 100-Amp Double Pole 120/240-Volt 10KAIC Lug In/Lug Out Breaker\" COL feature VAL \"UL Listed Lug in, lug out Type BQ Line side lugs included\" COL description VAL \"The Siemens type BQ Circuit Breaker is acable-in, cable-out, non-interchangeable trip molded case circuit breaker available in 10-125A, 1-, 2-, and 3-pole.
