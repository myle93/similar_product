The ink dries quickly so you don't have to worry about smearing your card, or getting ink all over your hand and fingers. When using laminated bingo cards, daubers are more efficient than plastic chips because the ink can be wiped off and the cards can be used again. Similarly, if you play Bingo with multiple cards, it's faster and easier to mark your spaces with a quick dab of ink than it is to place a marker. Daubers are also more convenient because you don't have to worry about chips sliding off the card, causing you to lose track of which spaces have been called.

An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls.

A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer.This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot for 12 and cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce beverage bottle is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. Top of the line construction and rubber gaskets keep this bottle leak-proof and because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency.

CENTER STRAP ENGAGES CORE - Attach resistance band to center strap to engage core and for multi-planar exercises RESISTANCE BANDS NOT INCLUDED - HANDCRAFTED IN THE USA\" COL description VAL \" <b>Mimic barbell exercises with resistance bands.</b> The 40\" Resistance Band Bar is perfect for traditional biceps and triceps curls, standing military presses, standing/upright rows, overhand grip hammer curls, and much, much, more! Once you get your hands on an Anazao Fitness Gear resistance band bar you'll not only rethink your resistance band training but your fitness and conditioning workouts altogether. There is no better way to use resistance bands with confidence, stability, free range of motion and comfort. Resistance bands sold separately <b>The benefits of the 3rd Strap</b> You can do everything with the 3-Strap Bar that you can do with the 2-Strap Bar + work multiple muscles and engage your core while doing traditional curls. The added function of connecting an additional resistance band to the center strap is what makes the 40\" 3-strap resistance band bar one of a kind. First, connect resistance bands to the outside connection rings and then add another resistance band by connecting both carabiners to the middle strap to increase and distribute resistance along the length of the bar when performing curls (biceps, triceps, hammer, etc.). This creates an amazing functional workout while receiving the benefits of multi-planar exercise. The increased resistance and longitudinal distribution causes you to engage your core and maintain proper posture throughout each repetition. Exercise videos and instructions available online for free. <b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> Anazao Fitness Gear is recommended for use with Bodylastics resistance bands with D.G.S technology. These bands feature anti-snap technology and sturdy metal carabiners making them safer and more durable than standard resistance bands.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"SAVFY 2 Bikes Cover, 180T Heavy Duty Outdoor Waterproof Bicycle Cover - Sutis Mountain Bike, Road Bike\" COL feature VAL \"HIGH QUALITY MATERIAL: This bike cover is crafted with 180T nylon polyester material with PU coating, which is of high density and durability.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "label": 0}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"", "label": 0}

An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer.This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot for 12 and cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce beverage bottle is virtually unbreakable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. Top of the line construction and rubber gaskets keep this bottle leak-proof and because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency.

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><font color=CC6600>In-Ground Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><font color=CC6600>Wall-Mount Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><font color=CC6600>Portable Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><font color=CC6600>Backboard Considerations</font></strong><br> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Deluxe Recordable Megaphone\" COL feature VAL \"AUDIO PROJECTION: The Mega Sound Megaphone has a 200 yard audible projection range VOICE RECORDING: The megaphones 10 second recording and playback feature allows you to continuously repeat your message when needed EMERGENCY SIREN: A built-in siren is included for emergency situations CONSTRUCTION: The megaphone has a weather resistant ABS construction and a folding handle with a lanyard.

The three companies, collectively combined, are now the largest basketball equipment supplier in the world. Spalding is the official basketball supplier of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the official backboard of the NBA and NCAA, the official volleyball of the King of the Beach Volleyball Tour and the official football of the Arena Football League (AFL) and Pop Warner. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\"><big>Amazon.com Basketball System Buying Guide</big></span></strong><br /> With the high-quality construction of many portable basketball systems, turning your driveway into a basketball court can be as simple as hooking up your garden hose. But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">In-Ground Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Wall-Mount Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Portable Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><span style=\"color: #cc6600;\">Backboard Considerations</span></strong><br /> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "label": 0}

The company has since expanded past elk decoys and now makes more than 18 different decoys. The modern day success story is one of true hard work and dedication by Jerry, his family and close friends. Now this soft-spoken hunter from Montana is well known in the hunting community and his products are found in most outdoors shops, both big and small.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Montana Decoy Design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jerry McPherson`s Montana Decoys are a two-dimensional, photo realistic decoy. The body of the decoy is a print of a high-quality photo on a cotton / polyester fabric. This picture is mirrored and printed on the opposite side so that no matter which direction a critter approaches from they will always see the decoy. To keep the material erect, a steel band is sewn in between the two pieces of printed material. This steel band is the key to the decoy being so portable.

Our lasers are powered to the maximum legal strength! The 532 nm wavelength laser beam makes it perfect for use at night or day. The Reactor 5 can reach targets up to 100 yards away in the daylight and two miles at night. The battery life is outstanding, lasting up to two hours making it more reliable than any other laser sight. It also includes a dual color battery indicator, letting you know when it is time to replace the battery. The green laser is not only highly visible, accurate and compact, its also super light-weight and is designed specifically for your gun. With Viridians ECR technology, the Reactor 5 automatically switches on when drawn, reducing the chance of fumbling to activate the sight in a critical self-defense situation. When you draw, its on! This makes it ideal for home protection from dangerous intruders or in self-defense situations. Along with its no hassle design, it includes a custom holster for your gun, making it a low-profile addition that is easy to conceal and carry. The laser sight is built from high strength thermo molded polymer making it virtually weightless and extremely durable. The Reactor 5 green laser sight is easy to install in only a few minutes, secures tightly to the gun and is easily adjustable.

The sleeve is integrated into the hammock itself and will accommodate most any 20 wide standard size inflatable pad on the market. With your inflatable pad in the dedicated sleeve, Sky Bed provides built in thermal protection which never moves. The rigidity of the inflatable pad creates the stunningly flat, insulated and cozy sleeping surface. It is a much easier solution for hammock insulation than buying an expensive and bulky under quilt. If you have always wanted a flatter laying hammock or a hammock that keeps you warmer at night then Sky Bed is the answer. Sky Bed is made from super strong rip stop nylon, which is reinforced with webbing at all of the seams. Weighing in a only 23 oz and complete with 100 inches of climbing rope suspension on each end, Sky Bed is arguably the most satisfying portable camping hammock on earth.

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><font color=CC6600>In-Ground Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711\">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><font color=CC6600>Wall-Mount Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741\">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><font color=CC6600>Portable Systems</font></strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731\">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><font color=CC6600>Backboard Considerations</font></strong><br> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \"", "label": 0}

The ink dries quickly so you don't have to worry about smearing your card, or getting ink all over your hand and fingers.

Similarly, if you play Bingo with multiple cards, it's faster and easier to mark your spaces with a quick dab of ink than it is to place a marker.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Token Products Lock Ring for Shimano 11T Cassette\" COL feature VAL \"TK041Sfor Shimano 11T cassette Weight: 5.4g Colour options: red, gold, black, blue\" COL description VAL \"Token Cassette Lock Ring, CNC aluminium, BC1.29\" x 24T, Shimano 11 tooth, Colour options: red, gold, black, blue, Weight: 5.4g.\"", "label": 0}

The Oasis1100 by TETON Sports comes with a leakproof 2-Liter hydration bladder and is thoughtfully designed with plenty of room for all the gear you want to keep handy. Rehydrate easilywherever your adventure may take you. The Oasis1100 hydration pack is an 18-Liter backpack designed to fit close to the body and weighs only 2 pounds unfilled. You can adjust the shoulder, chest, or waist straps to get a custom fit. It comes in a wide variety of colors and includes features normally seen on more expensive packs such as a shock absorbing chest strap, built-in safety whistle, reflective trim, bungee storage with barrel lock and many more. This super comfortable pack includes a thick air mesh back panel with 1/2 foam pads that fit tightly to minimize bounce. Shoulder straps have comfort-taped mesh with a notched foam stabilizer. The Oasis 1100 includes a free 2-liter hydration bladder with a large opening to make cleaning easy. You will want to wash your bladder before your first use: Rinse out your bladder and hose with lemon juice or mild soap and warm water to remove any residuesthen let your bladder dry out completely before reassembling it. You may need to prop the bladder open with paper towels to allow it to dry completely. Once it is dry, reassemble it. Be sure to tighten the hose at the base of the bladderthe O-ring gasket needs to sit down into the receiver so it can seal properly--this will prevent leaking. The kink-free sip tube is lightweight, but durable and the cushioned bite valve is easy to open or close: simply pull the mouth piece to open it and push it closed when youre done drinking. To avoid drinking warm water, remember to drain the hose before you take your next sip. This can be done by blowing the water back into the bladder after each use. To lengthen the life of your hydration bladder:  Only use water in the bladderacidic juices, alcohol, or milk will promote bacterial growth and corrosion  This bladder should not be exposed to temperatures over 120F or under 0F  After every use, thoroughly clean the bladder, tube, and valve with a mild, anti-bacterial detergent  Avoid prolonged exposure to UV light  And keep your bladder away from sharp objects Limited Lifetime Warranty - TETON Sports strives to manufacture the best possible products for our customers. Our limited lifetime warranty covers your backpack against defects in materials or workmanship for as long as you own it. The water reservoir, bite valve, and drink tube are covered against defects in materials or workmanship for a one-year period. Our warranties are cheerfully extended to the original owner only and exclude normal wear and tear (e.g., zippers that wear out after extended use) or misuse.

Freshness and safety go hand in hand. If contents are not kept at the right temperature, potentially dangerous bacteria may grow rapidly and cause food and beverages to spoil. All FOOGO stainless steel products feature THERMOS vacuum insulation technology which has been shown to inhibit the growth of bacteria in a laboratory test sponsored by Thermos and performed by Cornell University. For additional peace of mind, FOOGO products use BPA-free materials. FOOGO products are offered in three styles that are designed to grow with your child. Soft spout sippy cups with handles are for children 6 months and older, hard spout sippy cups are for children 12 months and older, and straw bottles are for children ages 18 months and older. The FOOGO Stainless Steel Straw Bottle makes it easy to keep drinks cold on the go. This bottle has a 10-ounce capacity and features THERMOS vacuum insulation technology to keep contents cold for up to 12 hours. The contoured shape of this bottle is easy for little toddler hands to grip and hold. The FOOGO straw bottle is a great choice for a child's first real straw bottle. Unlike other straw bottles, the FOOGO straw bottle can be used to teach kids to drink from a real straw, without built-in valves that inhibit flow. Thanks to the durable double wall stainless steel construction and vacuum insulation, this FOOGO straw bottle will not gather condensation or leave water rings. A hygienic push button lid is simple to open and reveals a pop-up silicone straw that is comfortable to drink from. Cleaning is simple, just unscrew the lid and the straw can be completely removed and disassembled to two parts for easy cleaning. The bottle and straw parts are top-rack dishwasher safe, however, hand washing is recommended for best results. Not for use with hot liquids.\"", "label": 0}

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Jagwire Mountain Pro Extreme Disc Brake Pad Avid Elixir R CR Mag 1 3 5 7 9 X.O\" COL feature VAL \"Compatible with Avid Elixir R, CR, CR Mag, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, X.0, XX, World cup Compatible with SRAM DB, DB5, Level, Level T, Level TL Sintered compound provides maximum durability and consistency, especially in inclement weather Steel backing plate These disc brake pads fit a variety of SRAM and Avid brakes and offer industry leading brake compounds for consistent, confident performance.\" COL description VAL \"These disc brake pads fit a variety of SRAM and Avid brakes and offer industry leading brake compounds for consistent, confident performance.

You see, SwissStop pads are made by a Swiss company named Rex Articoli SA. They manufacture high-tech rubber bits for industry. In fact, SwissStop brake pads are the only consumer item that they produce. Their 70 years of experience in technical compounds allows them to produce brake pads with highly tuned performance characteristics. SwissStop pads have superior stopping power, low pad-wear rates, very linear brake response, and a smooth, quiet performance. Think of them as the Assos or the SRM of brake pads. FlashPro means one thing: These are compatible with Shimano and SRAM brake pad holders. To better the performance over the previous Flash pads, the FlashPro has deeper asymmetrical grooves and a more pronounced leading edge profile. The idea is to \"squeegee\" away more water to improve the wet weather performance and the deeper grooves help give the pads better modulation. They increased the total pad depth with more material above the wear line -- good news for those folks that live in the high mountains. The Original Black compound is SwissStop's standard all-purpose replacement pad for aluminum rims. It's ideal if you don't use carbon rims and if you don't relish the idea of riding in the rain. Please note that they do just fine in the rain, but SwissStop makes better pads for you if you find yourself in the wet stuff on a regular basis. One order gets you 4 pads total -- enough for one bike.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"SunRace MX3 10-Speed 11-40T Cassette\" COL feature VAL \"Shimano or Sram 10 Speed Compatible 11-40 Teeth, Sprocket Material: Alloy 7077 Lockring Spacers Material: Alloy Weight: 427g Made in Taiwan\" COL description VAL \"Shimano or Sram Compatible<br /> Speeds: 10<br /> Lockring Spacers Material: Alloy<br /> Sprocket Material: Alloy 7075<br /> Weight: 427g<br /> Made in Taiwan\"", "label": 0}

Moxie. Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that have contributed to Gerber's emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910, and one Christmas, he hired a local knife-maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939. It makes sense, really. An idea man gets the idea of a lifetime and turns it into a major outdoor brand--one that commands respect among knife lovers and knife makers alike. And now that same high regard is spreading in new directions, in the form of many outstanding products such as tools, personal L.E.D. lighting, and more. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Gerber 22-41121 Prodigy Survival Combat Knife, leg strap, and two attachment straps. <br clear=\"all\"><hr>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"5 Pack Police Magnum Pepper Spray 0.7oz OC-17 Pepper Spray Police Strength\" COL feature VAL \"5 Pack Assists in temporary incapacitation of an assailant for up to 30 minutes Delivers a potent liquid blast up to 10-12 feet Only use this while you are under attack Safety twist top\" COL description VAL \"Made in the U.S.A\"", "label": 0}

Using our system you make your firearms Cleaner Faster. The two radial diameters of our Jag Brush turns your cleaning rod into a dual-purpose cleaning system. A patch of any shape applied to the front of it wipes the bore, while, at the same time, the rear of the brush scrubs the bore wall. While a standard jag or loop pushes a patch only so far into rifling grooves, the flexibility of our bristles on a Jag Brush, allow it to reach further into grooves. Our product decreases the gap between the bristle tips and bore wall, and it creates a tighter fit. Due to the flex of the brush bristles, the system will not cause excess drag like that caused by standard gun cleaning gear. Excess drag caused by standard cleaning gear makes a combo stuck, or in the very least, makes the rod flex. Rod flex inside the bore causes premature damage to the bore reducing your firearm's accuracy well before its time. Our improvement over standard systems has not been available on the market until now. Our Jag Brush works best when used with our notched Triangle Patches but it also works with properly sized square or round patches. Nylon filaments do not react with ammonia based solvents to discolor patches.

The ultimate test of a trail camera is its performance. The Spartan GoCam features an under-one-second trigger speed. The IR LED array provides illumination to 70 feet and beyond for crisp, clear night images and videos. Photo resolution can be set as high as 8 MP, while video resolution can be as high as 720P HD (native) if you want to use the camera as a standard trail camera taking videos rather than transmitting photos. The camera can be set to overwrite the oldest photo on the SD card with the most recent if the SD card is full so you dont lose the most recent photos just because the SD card has filled. If you dont want the camera to take pictures all the time, you can set one or two duty periods, each with different trigger intervals and time-lapse settings. In order to provide excellent water resistance for outdoor use, there are flush case mating areas in both front and rear case halves. An oversized rubber gasket on the front case half, as well as an oversized double-hinged latch that is easily operated with gloved hands, ensure a complete water-resistant seal. The rear case houses 12 AA batteries, which provide several months of battery life 2 (Battery life is determined by the type of battery used, the camera settings and the number of pictures taken, etc.) The batteries are arranged in two bays so that each battery has its own slot, thus eliminating the common problem of batteries unseating.

Bristles at the front portion push a patch deeper into rifling than done by other jags or loops, and bristles at the rear portion brush the bore. Our Triangle Patch has one less radius than a square patch, and it means for the same amount of cotton fabric, a Triangle Patch reaches farther down a jag. The notches in its sides eliminate 5-layer folds so that the patch does not bunch up excessively. It means the triangular patch does not get stuck, even though it pushes more fabric against a bore than a square patch does. Because our Triangle Patch has a longer radius than a same caliber square patch, the triangle's corners reach into the rear section of our Jag Brush where bristles at a radial diameter larger than the bore push patch fabric deep into rifling grooves. The flexibility of bristles allows for deeper cleaning while at the same time doing it with a smooth passage and less rod flex. Our aluminum connectors are non-abrasive. Our carbon steel core wires are stronger than those of other metals, and stronger means less likely to bend or to loosen their grip on bristles. The combo is packaged in slide packs.

Using our system you make your firearms Cleaner Faster. The two radial diameters of our Jag Brush turns your cleaning rod into a dual-purpose cleaning system. A patch of any shape applied to the front of it wipes the bore, while, at the same time, the rear of the brush scrubs the bore wall. While a standard jag or loop pushes a patch only so far into rifling grooves, the flexibility of our bristles on a Jag Brush, allow it to reach further into grooves. Our product decreases the gap between the bristle tips and bore wall, and it creates a tighter fit. Due to the flex of the brush bristles, the system will not cause excess drag like that caused by standard gun cleaning gear. Excess drag caused by standard cleaning gear makes a combo stuck, or in the very least, makes the rod flex. Rod flex inside the bore causes premature damage to the bore reducing your firearm's accuracy well before its time. Our improvement over standard systems has not been available on the market until now. Our Jag Brush works best when used with our notched Triangle Patches but it also works with properly sized square or round patches. Its phosphor bronze bristles hold onto a patch so that the patch will stay on the brush when one wants during the return trip of the rod stroke. Our aluminum connectors are non-abrasive, and our carbon steel core wires have superior strength enabling them to resist bending. Brush comes packaged in a blister pack.
