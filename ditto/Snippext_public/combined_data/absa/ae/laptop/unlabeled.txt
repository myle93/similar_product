Is O
adapting O
to O
a O
new O
free O
alternative O
really O
that O
much O
of O
a O
problem O
? O

It O
worked O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
- O
both O
charging O
a O
low O
battery O
and O
keeping O
a O
full O
battery O
full O
. O

Cons O
: O
the O
Velcro O
included O
did O
n't O
have O
great O
sticking O
power O
. O

As O
mentioned O
, O
i O
would O
have O
purchased O
it O
on O
spot O
, O
but O
hesitated O
primarily O
because O
of O
128 O
GB O
disk O
drive O
, O
Graphics O
& O
foot O
print O
( O
need O
something O
that O
i O
can O
use O
in O
a O
confined O
space O
) O
... O

I O
am O
thinking O
about O
getting O
a O
couple O
of O
more O
for O
other O
rooms O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
if O
it O
continues O
to O
work O
well O
. O

Really O
networks O
well O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
little O
bit O
to O
get O
used O
to O
because O
it O
is O
much O
flatter O
than O
the O
usual O
mouse O
, O
but O
once O
you O
do O
this O
one O
is O
a O
no O
- O
brainer O
. O

On O
paper O
, O
this O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
capable O
computer O
in O
a O
very O
small O
- O
and O
beautifully O
designed O
package O
. O

K3-loaded O
, O
AFX O
mode O
- O
Sound O
very O
good O
... O

Sometimes O
you O
accidentally O
trigger O
the O
right O
mouse O
button O
when O
instead O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
use O
a O
2-finger O
gesture.- O

Do O
not O
buy O
this O
speaker O
! O

My O
other O
battery O
just O
died O
& O
that O
my O
only O
complaint O
with O
Toshiba O
laptops O
, O
but O
they O
do O
& O
last O
so O
much O
longer O
than O
Dell O
, O
Acer O
, O
etc O
. O

Pros O
: O
Small O
footprint O
, O
fast O
connection O
, O
works O
great O
for O
normal O
video O
, O
network O
and O
usb O
connections O
. O

Sure O
the O
hardware O
is O
n't O
high O
end O
- O
the O
screen O
is O
just O
adequate O
and O
the O
touchpad O
is O
clacky O
and O
a O
little O
small O
- O
but O
none O
of O
it O
gets O
in O
the O
way O

No O
I O
do O
n't O
remove O
the O
product O
when O
the O
program O
is O
active O
. O

Simple O
and O
logical O
, O
this O
station O
is O
backwards O
compatible O
with O
most O
Lenovo O
laptops O
and O
allows O
for O
" O
hot O
swapping O
" O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
about O
damage O
in O
the O
shipment O
, O
but O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
how O
well O
packaged O
the O
item O
was O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
one O
I O
have O
purchased O
as O
I O
broke O
one O
of O
the O
plastic O
legs O
on O
the O
first O
one O
through O
my O
own O
fault O
, O
not O
because O
of O
any O
quality O
issue O
of O
the O
product O
itself O
. O

it&#8217;s O
awkward O
at O
best O
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
that O
the O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
sensitivity O
range O
is O
as O
good O
as O
it O
gets O
. O

I O
got O
tired O
of O
that O
and O
decided O
to O
get O
a O
nicer O
netbook O
that O
was O
well O
balanced O
on O
my O
lap O
! O

We O
" O
upgraded O
" O
from O
a O
622 O
to O
a O
922 O
reviever O
. O

I O
have O
a O
mouse O
, O
Razer O
Nostromo O
, O
printer O
, O
and O
1 O
tb O

This O
backpack O
is O
perfect O
if O
you O
need O
space O
to O
organize O
all O
your O
school O
materials O
and O
electronics O
. O

If O
however O
you O
plan O
to O
get O
a O
HDMI O
/ O
DVI O
adapter O
and O
use O
it O
as O
a O
PC O
monitor O
things O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

These O
are O
n't O
awful O
speakers O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
deserves O
the O
high O
praise O
that O
it O
is O
getting O
. O

If O
the O
screen O
real O
estate O
is O
that O
important O
to O
you O
, O
you O
might O
consider O
going O
to O
an O
Apple O
Store O
and O
lifting O
one O
for O
yourself O
. O

so O
why O
fix O
it O
) O
and O
try O
to O
mess O
up O
some O
other O
devices O
. O

What O
I O
do O
like O
about O
them O
is O
that O
there O
are O
velcro O
fasteners O
that O
go O
around O
the O
bottom O

Did O
that O
a O
few O
times O
like O
instructed O
and O
it O
works O
perfect O
. O

LTS O
recognized O
the O
device O
and O
prompted O
me O
to O
install O
a O
Broadcom O
proprietary O
driver O
or O
open O
source O
driver O
. O

Easy O
to O
swap O
them O
and O
no O
configuration O
necessary O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
usb O
connection O
does O
not O
work O
... O

There O
is O
a O

And O
I O
've O
got O
the O
proof O
in O
my O
hand O
, O
with O
Asus O
labeling O
on O
it O
. O

My O
hands O
are O
larger O
so O
it O
's O
not O

for O
me O
to O
type O
an O

or O
work O

a O
document O
without O
tapping O
or O
rubbing O

Buy O
a O

I O
guess O
the O
only O
way O
you O
can O
now O
get O
my O
business O
is O
to O
cut O
into O
your O
margins O
even O
more O
and O
make O
darn O
sure O
you O
provide O
the O
absolute O
lowest O

A O
previous O
model O
Speck O
case O
that O
I O
used O
with O
an O
older O
macbook O
pro O
( O
pre O
- O
unibody O
) O
had O
an O
issue O
that O
allowed O
dust O
and O
debris O
to O
get O
between O
the O
case O
and O
computer O
and O
scratch O
the O
bottom O
of O
my O
computer O

The O
only O
con O
that O
I O
have O
with O
both O
of O
these O
fine O
lap O
tops O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
do O
not O
come O
with O
a O
start O
up O
disk O
. O

If O
I O
was O
using O
Skype O

I O
replaced O
the O
battery O
, O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

However O
, O
latter O
is O
also O
a O
disadvantage O
when O
trying O
to O
remove O
from O
the O
USB O
port O
without O
the O
cord O
. O

Keyboard O
is O
fine O
for O
me O
- O
layout O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
very O
well O
made O
. O

You O
're O
much O
better O
off O
getting O
a O
4 O
- O
5 O
dollar O
chinese O
dongle O
on O
amazon O
, O
and O
getting O
4 O
different O
kinds O
for O
the O
price O
of O
this O
, O
then O
throwing O
them O
away O
as O
they O
work O
about O
as O
well O
as O
rocketfish O
's O
. O

Will O
test O
the O
new O
one O
and O
update O
this O
comment O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
buying O
something O
so O
specific O
as O
a O
laptop O
battery O
without O
physically O
seeing O
it O
and O
knowing O
for O
sure O
it O
would O
be O
the O
right O
one O

Wonderful O
case O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Its O
inside O
dimensions O
are O
11 O
1/2 O
by O
8 O
1/2 O
inches O
. O

It O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
. O

Those O
days O
are O
long O
gone O
... O

The O
body O
of O
the O
laptop O
comes O
with O
a O
matte O
finish O
that O
is O
even O
impressive O
as O
it O
does O
n't O
attract O
fingerprints O
and O
is O
a O
stunning O
design O
. O

Scroll O
down O
to O
" O
DisplayLink O
Manager O
" O
and O
click O
it O
once O
. O

They O
can O
both O
be O
setup O
for O
small O
children O
in O
about O
one O
afternoon O
and O
are O
faster O
, O
more O
responsive O
and O
do O
not O
continually O
try O
to O
get O
you O
to O
submit O
your O
credit O
card O
. O

The O
Bluetooth O
pairing O
is O
flawless O
, O
it O
does O
it O
automatically O
each O
and O
every O
time O
, O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
note O
some O
minimal O
irregularity O
inside O
the O
plastic O
( O
as O
it O
's O
transparent O
you O
can O
note O
this O
) O
, O
and O
the O
fit O
could O
be O
a O
little O
better O
. O

It O
works O
well O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
fancy O
... O
except O
LOTS O
of O
e O
- O
mail O
for O
work O
and O
recently O
watch O
DVD O
's O
. O

This O
is O
the O
7th O
Acer O
laptop O
I O
have O
purchased O
, O
dating O
back O
to O
2006 O
. O

One O
thing O
that O
I O
will O
be O
looking O
for O
is O
some O
sort O
of O
hardcase O
for O
this O
pack O
. O

Sound O
is O
clean O
with O
maybe O
a O
little O
less O
emphasis O
on O
the O
bass O
than O
the O
PX100 O
's O
. O

Either O
one O
can O
cause O
sudden O
bursts O
of O
noise O
that O
will O
interrupt O
your O
flow O
of O
work O
. O

so O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
much O
space O

I O
plugged O
in O
this O
little O
guy O
, O
and O
BOOM O
! O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
something O
small O
, O
use O
the O
battery O
that O
the O
computer O
comes O
with O
. O

Works O
great O
for O
my O
little O
granddaughter O
, O
who O
also O
uses O
it O
for O
hours O
of O
gaming O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
mouse O
for O
anyone O
with O
a O
Bluetooth O
capable O
device O
that O
wants O
a O
super O
tiny O
, O
portable O
mouse O
. O

I O
only O
got O
a O
2nd O
drive O
for O
it O
because O
I O
thought O
maybe O
the O
first O
one O
went O
faulty O
, O
but O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

I O
was O
skeptical O
, O
as O
this O
cost O
SO O
much O
less O
then O
the O
USB O
cables O
at O
retail O
stores O
, O
but O
it O
did O
the O
job O
. O

and O
then O
I O
updated O
my O
Windows O
Performance O
index O
( O
Win7 O
pro O
64-bit O
) O
and O
it O
jumped O
from O
5 O
. O

Very O
Small O
and O
Inexpensive O
camera[+ O
] O
Decent O
Audio O
and O
Video O
Quality[+ O
] O

Microsoft O
had O
two O
mail O
clients O
- O
Outlook O
for O
money O
and O
Live O
Mail O
for O
free O
. O

Absolutely O
fantastic O
- O
and O
when O
you O
look O
at O
the O
cost O
? O

Whether O
this O
is O
a O
quirk O
of O
my O
particular O
battery O
or O
if O
that O
is O
standard O
on O
this O
battery O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

I O
would O
expect O
a O
product O
from O
3 O
M O
to O
have O
the O
best O
adhesive O
qualities O
and O
these O
labels O
do O
not O
disappoint O
. O

Thank O
you O
Amazon O
and O
Eforcity O
. O

It O
is O
so O
powerful O
and O
fast O
- O
starting O
it O
up O

It O
's O
really O
sticky O
and O
hard O
to O
apply O
. O

A O
real O
rocket O
. O

You O
always O
get O
scared O
not O
getting O
the O
original O
brand O

I O
added O
all O
mine O
up O
and O
had O
like O
685 O
watts O
minimum O
requirement O
, O
so O
this O
meant O
I O
needed O
at O
least O
a O
1200 O
watt O
power O
supply O
. O

While O
the O
Buffalo O
Technology O
may O
not O
be O
the O
smallest O
on O
the O
block O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
overall O
leader O
in O
its O
price O
range O
for O
a O
1 O
TB O
drive O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
be O
safe O
to O
go O
with O
this O
one O
. O

The O
ER-6 O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
neutral O
, O
accurate O
lowest O
distortion O
transducers O
available O
that O
is O
still O
efficient O
enough O
to O
be O
driven O
by O
most O
portable O
devices O
. O

TO O
ADD O
MORE O
COOLING O
FANS O
.. O

However O
, O
I O
purchased O
the O
Seagate O
drives O
after O
reading O
the O
Seagate O
hype O
and O
even O
watching O
a O
video O
about O
how O
they O
are O
fast O
and O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

The O
material O
is O
like O
memory O
foam O
so O
the O
Air O
is O
very O
nicely O
protected O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
hurt O
that O
it O
is O
put O
into O
a O
package O
with O
some O
seriously O
sturdy O
fabric O
and O
weather O
protection O
either O
. O

OS O
supported O
: O

Its O
a O
laptop O
case O
. O

but O
that O
's O
pretty O
much O
all O
you O
can O
find O
on O
the O
market O
today O
. O

I O
love O
backpacks O
. O

I O
use O
the O
product O
to O
join O
two O
different O
speak O
systems O
together O
. O

Also O
the O
laptop O
fan O
with O
how O
it O
is O
set O
to O
sit O
on O
your O
desk O
in O
the O
degree O
it O
has O
does O
n't O
seem O
too O
far O
extreme O
. O

It O
was O
all O
I O
could O
have O
asked O
for O
. O

since O
its O
not O
bulky O
, O
my O
Mac O
still O
fits O
on O
its O
slim O
envelope O
style O
bag O
. O

Lousy O
wireless O
network O
drive O
. O

I O
ca O
nt O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
take O
it O
apart O
for O
cleaning O

Hardly O
noticed O
anything O
different O
with O
the O
new O
update O
but O
I O
like O
to O
keep O
track O
with O
updates O
and O
performance O
. O

and O
the O
second O
one O
with O
a O
perfectly O
fine O
cord O
but O
dead O
fans O
. O

It O
's O
as O
if O
the O
plastic O
was O
n't O
cut O
right O
, O
or O
did O
n't O
fit O
together O
right O
when O
they O
constructed O
it O
. O

I O
will O
use O
it O
but O
I O
will O
certainly O
use O
my O
windows O
7 O
PC O
's O
every O
bit O
as O
much O
... O

Everything O
fit O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
tight O
fit O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
when O
I O
subtracted O
the O
operator O
associated O
problems O
or O
misconceptions O
from O
the O
difficulty O
with O
the O
Asus O
hardware O
there O
were O
only O
a O
few O
legitimate O
complaints O
about O
the O
machine O
. O

Wireless O
adaptor O
works O
great O
, O
best O
price O
by O
far O
on O
the O
web O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
, O
these O
are O
getting O
returned O
. O

Seems O
slow O
to O
start O
and O
stop O
, O
aggravated O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
audible O
clues O
of O
dialup O
phone O
connection O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
Samsung O
Slate O
, O
and O
want O
to O
dock O
it O
for O
desktop O
, O
this O
it O
the O
thing O
. O

Could O
be O
improved O
upon O
by O
an O
inside O
pocket O
but O
quite O
a O
nice O
value O

I O
hardly O
notice O
any O
glare O
on O
my O
bare O
screen O
, O
so O
this O
idea O
really O
is O
not O
needed O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
tested O
my O
wifi O
using O
speedtest O
. O

Ca O
n't O
get O
all O
the O
local O
channels O
. O

The O
only O
hiccups O
I O
have O
with O
it O
now O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
magnets O
are O
gone O

Very O
pleased O
to O
see O
the O
speed O
because O
it O
is O
just O
one O
more O
thing O
completed O
on O
a O
timely O
manner O
. O

Once O
I O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
pop O
the O
keyboard O
out O
( O
I O
used O
a O
tiny O
flat O
head O
screwdriver O
) O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
popped O
it O
off O
and O
small O
little O
black O
piece O
went O
flying O
out O
. O

but O
it O
sure O
beats O
using O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
. O

Your O
computer O
( O
like O
my O
Dell O
XPS O
Laptop O
) O
must O
have O
this O
special O
type O
of O
combo O
port O
. O

Even O
the O
speakers O
sound O
good O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

The O
fan O
hardly O
ever O
runs O
on O
high O
now O
, O
( O
used O
to O
run O
60 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
) O
and O
that O
saves O
the O
battery O
even O
more O
! O

The O
sound O
quality O
was O
fine O
, O
but O
found O
the O
volume O
to O
be O
not O
much O
louder O
than O
the O
iPad O
's O
max O
volume O
. O

beautiful O
and O
good O
quality O
and O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
too O
looks O
so O
nice O

I O
also O
occasionally O
run O
another O
machine O
in O
Hyper O
- O
V O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

Better O
yet O
, O
the O
old O
battery O
died O
after O
one O
laptop O
charge O
. O

No O
usable O
information O
on O
the O
website O
. O

I O
'm O
5'5&#34 O
; O
, O
and O
the O
straps O
work O
great O
for O
me O
-- O
although O
I O
use O
the O
pass O
- O
through O
feature O
if O
I O
'm O
also O
rolling O
a O
bag O
. O

04 O
LTS O
and O
after O
initial O
user O
account O
creation O
it O
downloaded O
some O
350 O
+ O
updates O
and O
legacy O
driver O
for O
the O
wireless O
card O
and O
things O
were O
much O
smoother O
. O

It O
is O
very O
light O
and O
the O
padding O
will O
protect O
your O
tablet O
against O
bumps O
and O
scrapes O
. O

He O
asked O
a O
few O
questions O
, O
and O
then O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
check O
, O
paypal O
, O
or O
an O
amazon O
gift O
card O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
well O
- O
padded O
( O
while O
still O
being O
very O
light O
and O
easy O
for O
her O
to O
carry O
) O
, O
it O
also O
has O
a O
HANDLE O
. O

Quality O
seems O
good O
, O
fit O
& O
finish O
are O
fine O
, O
it O
's O
solid O
, O
I O
even O
like O
the O
keyboard O
. O

so O
it O
was O
pretty O
easy O
. O

Good O
extension O
for O
your O
car O
charger O
... O
particularly O
the O
two O
USB O
ports O
, O
which O
work O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

These O
gaming O
rigs O
are O
just O
not O
meant O
to O
be O
maintained O
and O
limped O
along O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
the O
replacement O
parts O
for O
critical O
components O
are O
just O
as O
bad O
as O
starting O
over O
. O

I O
love O
this O
laptop O
. O

Now O
... O
battery O
life O
. O

They O
ship O
both O
caps O
connected O
they O
are O
kind O
of O
hard O
to O
get O
apart O
at O
first O
they O
do O
fit O
fine O
on O
my O
lens O
and O
camera O
. O

Even O
after O
doing O
that O
, O
the O
devcie O
still O
only O
responds O
to O
web O
requests O
of O
the O
10 O
. O

However O
, O
the O
700 O
t O
added O
features O
makes O
it O
a O
MUCH O
better O
pick O
for O
my O
use O
. O

All O
I O
had O
to O
do O
was O
install O
the O
card O
into O
an O
available O
PCMCIA O
slot O
while O
the O
laptop O
was O
powered O
off O
. O

Great O
IPS O
screen O
. O

I O
have O
several O
laptops O
- O
one O
is O
only O
11 O
. O

Construction O
is O
spot O
on O
and O
does't O
look O
like O
a O
typical O
camera O
bag O
. O

No O
errors O
in O
Device O
Manager O
. O

The O
gauge O
of O
the O
cord O
is O
thick O
and O
feels O
tough O
, O
the O
connectors O
are O
gold O
plated O
or O
something O
, O
even O
the O
little O
box O
the O
cable O
is O
packaged O
in O
give O
off O
a O
sense O
of O
high O
quality O
. O

No O
need O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
the O
bigger O
name O
brands O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
recommend O
it O
if O
you O
're O
just O
a O
casual O
user O
, O
even O
if O
you O
like O
the O
larger O
screen O
. O

It O
felt O
a O
little O
more O
cheap O
than O
the O
original O
, O
but O
it O
worked O
just O
fine O
, O
so O
no O
complaints O
! O
! O

This O
has O
a O
blue O
light O
on O
it O
that O
flickers O
with O
drive O
activity O
. O

I O
was O
offered O
a O
free O
additional O
power O
supply O
if O
I O
wrote O
a O
review O
. O

I O
'll O
try O
to O
come O
back O
here O
after O
I O
have O
more O
time O
to O
play O
with O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
ad O
a O
xmas O
present O
for O
my O
dad O
so O
he O
could O
stream O
his O
radio O
show O
through O
the O
house O
. O

With O
the O
screen O
slid O
open O
, O
it O
functions O
as O
a O
netbook O
, O
but O
again O
, O
it O
is O
heavier O
and O
bulkier O
than O
the O
original O
netbooks O
( O
and O
the O
battery O
does O
not O
last O
as O
long O
) O
. O

The O
antennas O
are O
detachable O
, O
and O
use O
a O
standard O
connector O
( O
RP O
- O
SMA O
) O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
option O
to O
replace O
the O
antennas O
if O
you O
wish O
to O
maximize O
range O
. O

Just O
go O
and O
grab O
one O
. O

and O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
risk O
scratching O
the O
tablet O
) O
. O

It O
is O
very O
portable O
( O
smaller O
than O
most O
cordless O
phone O
handsets O
) O
and O
one O
of O
the O
easiest O
plug O
- O
n O
- O
play O
devices O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
quite O
annoying O
. O

However O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
you O
to O
sign O
up O
, O
they O
will O
tell O
you O
anything O
and O
make O
any O
promise O
it O
takes O
. O

Open O
the O
tower O
, O
unscrew O
a O
pci O
slot O
cover O
, O
pop O
this O
in O
, O
screw O
the O
thing O
in O
and O
voila O
. O

I O
know O
, O
seems O
insignificant O
, O
but O
it O
matters O
to O
some O
. O

A O
little O
flailing O
with O
setting O
up O
displays O
up O
to O
get O
1920 O
X O
1080 O
to O
show O
up O
on O
the O
TV O
... O

I O
received O
this O
product O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
in O
exchange O
for O
an O
honest O
review O
. O

1080p O
videos O
play O
back O
from O
an O
SD O
card O
, O
no O
problem O
. O

Worked O
out O
of O
the O
box O
without O
installing O
anything O
on O
my O
Ubuntu O
13 O
. O

Intermittently O
with O
use O
, O
the O
numbers O
would O
spike O
quickly O
to O
a O
number O
well O
outside O
of O
the O
range O
, O
but O
almost O
instantly O
return O
to O
the O
range O
numbers O
. O

So O
what O
, O
love O
this O
cord O
, O
the O
extra O
10 O
ft O
will O
come O
in O
handy O
when O
I O
least O
expect O
it O
( O
I O
'm O
sure O
) O
. O

Yet O
, O
its O
slow O
as O
can O
be O
with O
an O
i7 O
processor O
. O

There O
are O
very O
few O
bags O
on O
the O
market O
right O
now O
that O
can O
handle O
the O
large O
laptops O
that O
are O
coming O
out O
right O
now O
. O

This O
was O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
, O
very O
simple O
, O
no O
USB O
fans O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
... O
but O
it O
really O
is O
not O
wide O
enough O
and O
the O
laptop O
seems O
a O
little O
unstable O
on O
it O
. O

So O
I O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
high O
quality O
, O
but O
inexpensive O
cable O
. O

The O
wires O
inside O
got O
detached O
from O
both O
ends O
, O
because O
when O
I O
packed O
the O
cable O
to O
put O
in O
my O
bag O
the O
wires O
were O
moving O
inside O
the O
plastic O
wrapping O
( O
I O
literally O
took O
the O
whole O
cable O
apart O
and O
checked O
after O
the O
third O
one O
stopped O
working).I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
cable O

I O
'd O
rather O
have O
too O
many O
than O
not O
enough O
! O

i O
use O
emule O
, O
bitcomet O
, O
and O
about O
4 O
chat O
programs O
and O
i O
guess O
that O
overloads O
it O
& O
it O
disconnects O
.. O

; O
Sony O
Vaio O
( O
including O
its O
insanely O
large O
power O
brick O
) O
and O
still O
keep O
all O
of O
the O
above O
in O
the O
bag O
... O
with O
a O
more O
snug O
fit O
. O

I O
think O
its O
due O
to O
Windows O
8 O
, O
which O
is O
the O
lightest O
version O
yet O
. O

There O
is O
no O
issue O
with O
hangups O
at O
all O
for O
me O
when O
loading O
pages O
. O

Prefer O
to O
uninstall O
the O
Charms O
/ O
LifeTiles O
or O
whatever O
moniker O
they O
put O
on O
these O
computer O
illiterate O
icons O
/ O
aliases O
and O
go O
directly O
to O
the O
Desktop O
. O

Does O
n't O
look O
bad O
( O
if O
you O
're O
one O
to O
care O
about O
that O
) O

The O
speakers O
are O
really O
bad O
, O
so O
you O
should O
invest O
in O
a O
home O
theatre O
system O
when O
you O
buy O
this O
. O

I O
just O
spent O
two O
days O
figuring O
out O
how O
to O
get O
this O
reliably O
working O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
running O
for O
3 O
hours O
now O

Sure O
, O
if O
you O
've O
never O
used O
it O
, O
it O
can O
be O
a O
tad O
overwhelming O
at O
first O
, O
( O
not O
really O
- O
maybe O
, O
just O
maybe O

Just O
install O
the O
drive O
and O
push O
the O
power O
button O
on O
the O
back O
. O

I O
have O
an O
Acer O
Aspire O
One O
, O
mini O
laptop O
, O
so O
does O
my O
daughter O
and O
niece O
, O
so O
I O
've O
happily O
owned O
3 O
Acer O
products O
. O

Final O
notes O
. O

He O
had O
recently O
purchased O
a O
7 O
inch O
tablet O
that O
came O
without O
a O
cover O

This O
purchase O
is O
one O
of O
my O
worst O
on O
Amazon O
. O

Computer O
wakes O
and O
sleeps O
oddly O
. O

I O
found O
it O
had O
stretched O
upon O
removal O
, O
and O
now O
does O
not O
fit O
properly O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
install O
( O
both O
physically O
and O
the O
drivers O
) O
, O
at O
least O
under O
windows7 O
. O

I O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
Sonos O
system O
that O
a O
year O
later O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
mother O
( O
75 O
) O
. O

It O
came O
but O
has O
some O
issue O
charging O
fully O
. O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
them O
for O
the O
price O
. O

I O
plugged O
it O
into O
my O
nearly O
- O
dead O
iPod O
and O
it O
recharged O
the O
device O
and O
gave O
me O
additional O
play O
time O
. O

This O
same O
factor O
, O
weight O
, O
also O
reflects O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
built O
of O
very O
substantial O
materials O
and O
it O
will O
wear O
very O
well O
. O

If O
something O
happen O
again O
I O
will O
return O
it O
immediately O
... O
and O
update O
this O
review O
. O

This O
looks O
and O
feels O
cheap O
and O
did O
not O
work O
for O
me O
, O
or O
for O
my O
friends O
. O

I O
use O
it O
in O
my O
car O
connected O
to O
an O
ipod O
that O
lives O
in O
the O
car O
, O
so O
it O
was O
connected O
once O
, O
functioned O
for O
eight O
weeks O
, O
then O
the O
car O
no O
longer O
got O
a O
signal- O

This O
laptop O
is O
the O
perfect O
blend O
of O
form O
and O
function O
. O

and O
I O
received O
the O
message O
on O
my O
TV O
to O
try O
again O
- O
which O
I O
did O
about O
a O
dozen O
more O
times O
with O
the O
same O
result O
. O

Ok O
, O
this O
last O
fear O
may O
seem O
odd O
. O

the O
reason O
i O
purchased O
this O
card O
in O
the O
first O
place O
.was O
to O
boot O
from O
OPERATING O
SYSTEMS O
on O
esata O
drives O
.the O

It O
was O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

No O
need O
for O
a O
separate O
software O
install O
. O

I O
might O
add O
that O
I O
also O
have O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
15 O
inch O
. O

The O
product O
, O
Rubber O
Eyepiece O
Eyecup O
for O
CANON O
Rebel O
( O
T3i O
T3 O

It O
is O
a O
great O
charger O
that O
fits O
wonderful O
and O
does O
not O
get O
hot O
. O

Windows O
7 O
Home O
Premium O
is O
great O
! O

If O
you O
want O
a O
5GHZ O
or O
dual O
capability O
in O
your O
device O
... O
make O
sure O
you O
shop O
for O
it O
specifically O
... O
and O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
. O

Happy O
web O

Seems O
the O
whole O
school O
... O
at O
an O
academic O
level O
... O
is O
going O
paperless O
. O

it O
is O
designed O
to O
have O
a O
web O
of O
wires O
hanging O
out O
behind O
it O
! O

Plugging O
in O
my O
HP O
Touchpad O
I O
went O
from O
only O
12 O
% O
to O
23 O
% O
charge O
. O

I O
should O
've O
just O
returned O
this O
when O
I O
could O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
everything O
would O
be O
till O
much O
later O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
a O
Flash O
issue O
. O

They O
are O
solid O
, O
well O
- O
made O
products O
that O
are O
incredibly O
reasonable O
and O
affordable O
. O

Very O
clever O
construction O
and O
the O
inbuilt O
USB O

Holds O
my O
Canon O
Rebel O
with O
an O
extra O
lens O
and O
my O
iPad O
. O

By O
plugging O
in O
the O
supplied O
USB O
dongle O
into O
the O
PC O
, O
I O
also O
have O
wireless O
PC O
Speakers O
! O

The O
smell O
will O
fade O
away O
pretty O
quickly O
. O

I O
'm O
hoping O
in O
the O
future O
they O
'll O
add O
additional O
colors O
. O

I O
will O
say O
that O
it O
seems O
thicker O
, O
though O
, O
which O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
blue O
and O
I O
got O
the O
white O

. O

Glass O

absolutely O
clean O
with O
no O
traces O
of O

left O
behind O
. O

No O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
sound O
like O
a O
shelf O
stereo O
system O
, O
but O
it O
does O
have O
a O
deep O
, O
rich O
sound O
-- O
impressive O
for O
it O
's O
size O
. O

No O
bugs O
yet O
has O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
weeks O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
battery O
the O
netbook O
is O
still O
smaller O
than O
anything O
else O
, O
and O
now O
I O
can O
go O
all O
day O
w O
/ O
out O
plugging O
in O

It O
is O
durable O
enough O
to O
put O
up O
with O
being O
in O
my O

and O
the O

tucks O

You O
are O
only O
permitted O
to O
make O
one O
copy O
of O
the O
restor O
disk O
from O
the O
computer O
, O
uh O
what O
happens O
if O
something O
go O
wrong O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
a O
good O
disk O
, O
what O
happens O
if O
you O
break O
a O
disk O
? O

I O
wanted O
to O
use O
the O
Smart O
Sleeve O
as O
a O
travel O
case O
- O
for O
that O
it O
suits O
my O
needs O
nicely O
. O

As O
other O
reviewers O
found O
out O
, O
you O
should O
initially O
use O
the O
CD O
setup O
disk O
. O

This O
was O
a O
simple O
drop O
in O
replacement O
. O

The O
inner O
dimensions O
mentioned O
with O
the O
product O
do O
not O
include O
the O
foam O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
fastest O
machine O
with O
which O
I O
have O
ever O
worked O
. O

and O
I O
will O
unplug O
mines O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

I O
do O
much O
the O
same O
thing O
down O
here O
on O
Sanibel O
Island O
, O
where O
for O
another O
book O
I O
take O
my O
computer O
with O
me O
in O
my O
pickup O
, O
or O
on O
my O
bicycle O
, O
to O
dig O
up O
such O
details O
as O
beach O
parking O
lot O
spaces O
and O
hiking O
trail O
finds O
. O

The O
only O
difference O
is O
that O
the O
16 O
incher O
uses O
a O
caching O
SSD O
which O
would O
make O
any O
computer O
a O
lot O
faster O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
as O
fast O
as O
my O
own O
. O

Also O
it O
is O
very O
low O
profile O
. O

The O
flash O
hard O
drive O
makes O
allows O
the O
MacBook O
to O
boot O
and O
recover O
from O
sleep O
mode O
very O
quickly O
. O

No O
indicator O
light O
to O
see O
if O
it O
is O
getting O
power O
, O
I O
had O
to O
put O
my O
ear O
to O
it O
to O
hear O
it O
running O
and O
feel O
the O
fan O
. O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
the O
bag O
is O
comfortable O
on O
the O
back O
and O
can O
be O
carried O
by O
the O
handle O
as O
well O
. O

Unless O
you O
receive O
a O
defective O
or O
DOA O
product O
then O
this O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Would O
I O
recomend O
it O
to O
a O
friend O
? O

Pairing O
is O

Software O
allows O
you O
to O
program O
, O
however O
worst O
software O
of O
the O
3 O
as O
programming O

As O
to O
the O
glare O
on O
the O
frame O
, O
give O
me O
a O
break O
. O

But O
receiving O
this O
one O
was O
a O
disappointment O
because O
many O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
are O
misleading O
about O
the O
rear O
guide O

. O

that O

it O

; O
it O

I O

and O

I O
like O
the O

but O
I O
only O
it O
worked O
with O
my O

, O

I O
have O
had O

I O
was O
satisfied O

I O

you O
do O

Overall O

if O
your O

DO O
IT O

It O
does O
however O
charge O

my O

I O
continue O

it O

Purchased O
for O
an O

I O
wanted O

so O
I O

REAL O

WORLD O
USETo O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
was O
curious O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
ignored O
the O
instructions O
. O

If O
you O
're O
not O
good O
with O
computers O
, O
you O
may O
prefer O
to O
keep O
it O
. O

Made O
sure O
USB O

plugs O
were O
good O
.. O

It O
does O
rattle O
a O
bit O
from O

Figured O
I O
would O
see O
what O
the O
cable O
that O
came O
with O
the O
card O
was O
all O
about O
, O
turns O
out O
this O
is O
a O
power O
supply O
cable O
for O
the O
card O
, O
so O
one O
of O
my O
two O
original O
USB O
ports O
on O
my O
laptop O
, O
now O
has O
to O
be O
used O
to O

the O

so O
I O
have O
only O
really O
achieved O
gaining O
one O
extra O
USB O
port O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

The O
battery O
is O
not O
removable O
. O

This O
charger O
is O
designed O
for O
laptop O
batteries O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
being O
anemic O
on O
the O
power O
. O

and O
is O
a O
genuine O
product O
. O

I O
did O
dump O
Norton O
for O
another O
package O
but O
that O
was O
needed O
to O
enhance O
performance O
. O

When O
I O
received O
it O
, O
I O
embraced O
myself O
for O
much O
confusion O
and O
a O
huge O
learning O
curve O
. O

Used O
this O
way O
, O
there O
is O
padding O

I O
won&#8217;t O
detract O
from O
the O

due O
to O
that O
omission O
since O
it&#8217;s O
clearly O
described O
as O
a O
non O

, O
but O
wanted O
to O

It O
works O
flawlessly O

it O
makes O
it O
so O
easy O
take O
your O

and O
run O
by O
only O
disconnecting O

, O
insead O
of O
needing O
to O
remove O
all O
the O
cables O
going O
to O
your O

, O
and O
is O
even O
better O
adapted O
to O

this O

We O

much O
I O
love O
this O
bag O

DBRoth O
stands O
by O

but O
requires O
some O
patience O
. O

It O
's O
not O
infinitely O
adjustable O
, O
but O
has O
about O
8 O
presets O
for O
length O
; O
I O
found O
that O
ample O
to O
choose O
from O
. O

And O
, O
tucked O

is O
a O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
budget O
minded O
people O
who O
want O
a O
cam O
the O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
, O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
an O

cam O
then O
try O
Microsoft O

, O
which O
is O
the O
best O
IMHO O
. O

If O
you O
need O
the O
super O

long O

and O
not O
as O
concerned O
with O
weight O
then O
this O
battery O
is O
probably O
what O
you O
want O

BUY O
THIS O
PRODUCT O
! O

First O
off O
, O
the O
drive O
is O
housed O
in O
a O
cheap O
case O
made O
of O
very O
thin O
metal O

plastic O
. O

Simple O
, O
effective O
, O
and O
easy O

ohh O
and O
use O
pandora O
and O
youtube O
and O
listen O
to O
it O
on O
my O
radio O
.. O

This O
is O
the O
one O
for O
me O
an O
it O
last O
as O
long O
as O
the O
toshiba O
battery O
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
.. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I O
've O
found O
a O
number O
of O
other O
uses O
that O
has O
really O
made O
this O
a O
favorite O
gadget O
of O
mine O
. O

The O
other O
part O
that O
did O
n't O
impress O
me O
was O
the O
tiny O
velcro O
closure O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
purchase O
and O

It O
is O
also O
noticeable O
that O
I O
have O
setup O
a O
second O
monitor O
( O

This O
device O
is O
rapidly O
replacing O
everything O
but O
the O
cell O
. O

so O
I O
could O
buy O
another O
one O
! O

It O
fits O
my O

. O

I O
massively O
lowered O
my O
standards O

given O
up O

anything O

hi-8 O
in O
regard O
to O
making O
stop O

) O
, O
but O
I O
at O
least O
thought O
I O
could O
get O
a O
camcorder O
that O
would O
decently O
record O
people O
sitting O
at O
a O
table O
talking O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
it O
's O
really O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
luggage O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
portable O
speaker O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
I O
know O
multiple O
people O
who O
have O
returned O
there O
bose O
for O
this O
one O
which O
is O
much O
cheaper O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
product O
that O
works O
or O
not O
. O

it O

use O
it O
as O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
NOISY O

makes O
it O
impossible O
for O

to O

these O

You O
can O
fiddle O
around O

get O
it O
looking O

little O
better O
though O

Initially O
, O
the O
big O

turned O
me O
off O

now O
I O
understood O
why O

made O
it O
bigger O
than O

comparable O
tablets O
. O

It O
's O
a O
lens O
cleaning O

, O
and O
it O
includes O
a O
retractable O
brush O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
soft O
chemical O
cleaning O
pad O
for O
smudges O
. O

and O
I O
could O
n't O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
get O
the O
thing O
working O
... O

ya O

I O
have O
the O

version O
of O
this O

it O

way O

For O
one O
, O
in O
seconds O
you O
can O
slap O
in O
a O
4 O

card O
and O
devote O
it O
to O

, O
is O
basically O
a O

They O

may O

* O
Unlike O

The O

is O
a O
bit O
small O
to O
make O
that O
happen O
, O
but O
it O
does O
work O
well O
if O
all O
you O
want O
to O
do O
is O
carry O
your O
netbook O
and O
a O

Seems O
like O
it O
might O
be O
because O
the O
verticle O
jacks O
are O
almost O
flush O

in O
the O

The O
sounds O
is O
pretty O
good O
most O

I O
get O

what O
an O

I O
wished O
the O

out O

something O
similar O

not O

it O

of O

They O
quickly O

I O
already O
had O

up O
from O
my O
old O

but O
I O
needed O
a O
way O
to O
hook O
up O
my O

I O
love O
that O
little O
machine O
and O
take O
it O
along O
wherever O
I O
go O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
if O
you O
need O
more O
USB O
slots O
. O

It O
's O
worked O
just O
fine O
with O
no O
hiccups O
. O

It O
needed O
a O
separate O
attachment O
for O
it O
to O
even O
work O
with O
the O
tablet O
that O
it O
is O
made O
for O
. O

It O
would O
also O
be O
advisable O
to O
download O
the O
latest O

to O
version O
A10 O
from O
the O

came O

Most O

slow O
down O

but O
this O
is O
almost O
as O
good O
as O
a O
100Mbps O

. O

I O
'll O
be O
carrying O
this O
as O
a O
backup O
to O
my O
main O
power O
supply O
from O
now O
on O
simply O
for O
the O
ability O
to O
help O
others O
at O
events O
and O
conferences O
where O
they O
've O
lost O
or O
forgotten O
their O

more O
becuase O
its O
faster O
and O
has O
a O
bigger O

, O
just O
a O
little O
dissapointed O

The O
power O
and O
volume O
controls O
are O
easily O
manipulated O

Great O
item O

I O
'd O
give O
this O
5 O
stars O
but O
when O
I O
originally O
set O
this O
up O
( O
with O
2 O
SATA O
drives O
) O
one O
of O
the O
drives O
was O
n't O
recognized O
by O
my O
computer O
. O

Its O
side O
camera O
access O
easily O
allowed O
me O
to O
take O
out O
/ O
store O
my O
camera O
without O
having O
to O
put O
down O
and O
open O
the O
whole O
backpack O
. O

1 O
as O
installed O
on O
this O
unit O
for O
a O
few O
days O
just O
to O
get O
a O
feel O
for O
its O
capabilities O

It O
also O
gets O
surprisingly O
hot O
under O
load O
. O

Eve O
windows O
8 O
runs O
pretty O
nice O
on O
it O
! O

Its O
been O
several O
months O
without O
a O
fix O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

For O
what O
these O
cost O
, O
they O
should O
have O
that O
feature O
. O

The O
box O
comes O
with O
a O
soft O
pouch O
so O
you O
do O
nt O
scratch O
up O
the O
shiny O
screen O
. O

lights O
dim O
when O
lap O
top O
is O
in O
sleep O
mode O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
playing O
games O
and O
using O
Team O

. O

No O
magic O
included O
! O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
that O
! O
! O
! O

Love O
how O
it O
looks O
. O

Based O
on O
experience O
using O
2 O
of O
their O
products O
, O
from O
my O
experience O
to O
date O
Anker O
is O
on O
the O
money O
with O
what O
is O
sought O
after O
by O
people O
from O
the O
mobile O
accessories O
market O
. O

One O
fix O
I O
considered O
was O
replacing O
the O
Atheros O
wireless O
card O
with O
an O
Intel O
. O

No O
problem O
though O
as O
it O
fits O
just O
fine O
in O
the O
side O
zip O
pocket O

Every O
time O
that O
touch O
keyboard O
pops O
up O
on O
the O
touchscreen O
just O
above O
the O
physical O
keyboard O
, O
my O
mind O
boggles O
. O

All O
looked O
to O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
've O
gotten O
my O
hands O
on O
. O

-1 O
star O
for O
not O
fitting O
flush O
with O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
MBP O
. O

The O
battery O
has O
a O
bulge O
at O
the O
base O
and O
tilts O
the O
laptop O
somewhat O
, O
giving O
a O
much O
more O
comfortable O
typing O
angle O
. O

Video O
work O
via O
Handbrake O
is O
similarly O
speedy O
. O

If O
in O
six O
or O
nine O
months O
a O
new O
version O
based O
on O
ION O
or O
something O
else O
comes O
along O
you O
can O
just O
buy O
another O
one O
and O
give O
your O
old O
one O
to O
someone O
and O
they O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

There O
are O
very O
few O
visible O
screws O
on O
the O
bottom O
, O
leading O
us O
to O
wonder O
if O
they O
're O
trying O
to O
dissuade O
tinkering O
under O
the O
hood O
? O

Super O
deal O
and O
super O
product O
. O

Being O
able O
to O
just O
use O
the O
built O
in O
" O
monitor O
rest O
" O
to O
prop O
the O
screen O
right O
in O
front O
of O
me O
, O
like O
a O
book O
stand O
, O
is O
perfect O
! O

Anyway O
, O
now O
I O
have O
a O
plain O
Windows O
7 O
installation O
on O
the O
SSD O
. O

Just O
like O
the O
other O
customer O
the O
battery O
does O
not O
fully O
charge O
and O
it O
stop O
working O
within O
a O
few O
charges O
. O

still O
no O
games O
and O
no O
windows O
Aero O
due O
to O
such O
a O
low O
Windows O
Experience O
rating O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
does O
n't O
respond O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
, O
and O
sometimes O
, O
it O
senses O
a O
tap O
when O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
I O
'm O
not O
tapping O
. O

Pros:-Simple O
to O
install O
- O
Works O
as O
expectedCons:-I O
ordered O
two O
, O
one O
for O
me O
and O
one O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
metal O
( O
Aluminium O
) O
exterior O
gives O
the O
unit O
a O
nice O
look O
and O
seemingly O
better O
rigidity O
than O
similar O
machines O
with O
an O
all O
plastic O
body O
. O

So O
I O
just O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
mention O
that O
. O

The O
sleeve O
should O
fit O
nicely O
in O
your O
carrying O
case O
for O
longer O
trips O
and O
it O
will O
protect O
the O
exterior O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
scratches O
and O
other O
surface O
damage O
that O
might O
occur O
if O
the O
laptop O
is O
not O
otherwise O
protected O
. O

Connector O
is O
much O
to O
large O
to O
connect O
to O
player O
. O

So O
i O
bought O
this O
, O
thinking O
its O
probably O
a O
waste O
of O
cash O
, O
ill O
get O
ripped O
. O

If O
you O
connect O
it O
via O
the O
analog O
connection O
, O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
get O
anything O
like O
the O
same O
experience O
. O

Had O
a O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
model O
right O

very O
well O
- O
The O
bag O
is O
well O
made O
but O
too O
snug O
, O
also O
wish O
I O
could O
take O
the O
strap O
off O
when O
not O
needed O
. O

This O
case O
is O
of O
the O
cheapest O
materials O
, O
is O
VERY O
fragile O
, O
and O
not O
worth O
1/4 O
the O
price O
. O

Have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
mine O
, O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
know O
where O
to O
get O
one O
in O
case O
it O
does O
. O

but O
then O
sometimes O
it O
would O
show O
the O
turn O
where O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

There O
are O
2 O
buttons O
to O
adjust O
the O
light O
of O
the O
resolution O
( O
hi O
and O
low O
) O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
adequate O
in O
a O
normally O
lit O
office O
. O

If O
you O
're O
a O
tech O
geek O
and O
enjoy O
modifying O
your O
notebook O
, O
this O
one O
is O
for O
you O
. O

This O
is O
the O
same O
technology O
used O
on O
cell O
phones O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
rapidly O
transfer O
files O
or O
even O
screen O

Loads O
of O
software O
that O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
need O
. O

Asus O
zenbook O
and O
Kirabook O
keyboard O
are O
good O
too O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
gave O
clamp O
sort O
of O
thing O
to O
clamp O
it O
to O
the O
laptop O
so O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
bother O
much O
when O
we O
have O
to O
lift O
both O
- O
laptop O
and O
cooler O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
move O
to O
another O
seat O
or O
table O
in O
home O
. O

There O
is O
a O
longer O
screw O
in O
the O
surge O
suppressor O
that O
goes O
through O
the O
cover O
plate O
and O
screws O
into O
the O
outlet O
just O
as O
the O
previous O
screw O
did O
. O

For O
a O
PC O
user O
who O
simply O
refuses O
to O
buy O
into O
the O
Apple O
mind O
- O
think O
- O
cult O
, O
this O
tablet O
has O
everything O
I O
like O
about O
the O
iPad O
without O
the O
PC O
incompatibility O
issues O
and O
lack O
of O
obvious O
features O
that O
the O
Apple O
design O
gods O
refuse O
to O
incorporate O
into O
the O
iPad O
( O
microSD O
slot O
, O
USB O
port O
( O
mini O
port O
on O
the O
tablet O
and O
std O
size O
port O

USB O
charger O
( O
separate O
micro O
USB O
port O
) O
, O
detachable O
keyboard O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
has O
some O
value O
on O
some O
PCs O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
included O
with O
all O
batteries O
. O

Henge O
Dock O
recommends O
that O
you O
buy O
either O
their O
own O
DVI O
adapter O
or O
Apple O
's O
to O
ensure O
a O
correct O
fit O
, O
but O
that O
's O
unnecessary O
. O

This O
cable O
works O
great O
, O
good O
quality O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
can O
take O
punishment O
as O
it O
lays O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
my O
car O
sometimes O
. O

The O
build O
quality O
looks O
good O
to O
me O
and O
it O
functions O
well O
. O

However O
I O
wish O
they O
had O
put O
a O
better O
lip O
on O
the O
bottom O
edge O
of O
the O
cooling O
pad O
- O
I O
really O
do O
not O
like O
the O
elastic O
strap O
as O
it O
covers O
up O
power O
button O
and O
does O
not O
keep O
the O
laptop O
in O
place O
. O

I O
take O
good O
care O
of O
my O
laptops O
and O
generally O
do O
n't O
purchases O
shells O
for O
them O
. O

Alienware O
has O
been O
around O
a O
long O
time O
and O
( O
even O
as O
a O
subset O
of O
Dell O
for O
almost O
a O
decade O
now O
) O
they O
still O
produce O
some O
of O
the O
best O
stock O
gaming O
machines O
available O
. O

As O

I O
plug O

I O
have O

two O

: O
the O
first O
was O
dreadful O

and O
the O
one O
I O
had O
this O
evening O
which O
was O
very O
efficient O
and O
helpful O
, O
save O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
now O
have O
to O
_ O
purchase O
_ O
another O

if O
I O
choose O

Overall O
, O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
an O
item O
that O
will O
protect O
your O
laptop O
against O
dings O
and O
scratches O
, O
this O
Thule O
is O
a O
good O
option O
. O

Works O
great O
with O
my O

The O

are O

's O
a O
great O
start O
by O
Asus O

These O
are O
great O
computers O

There O
is O
some O
two O
finger O
tap O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad O
but O
that O
is O
n't O
obvious O
or O
natural O
for O
me O
. O

However O
I O
have O
had O
problems O
with O
the O
signal O
. O

I O
used O
to O
dislike O
Windows O
8 O
, O
but O
my O
views O
have O
completely O
changed O
after O
playing O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

Apple O
sealed O
the O
box O
lid O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
hard O
plastic O
designed O
to O
hang O
the O
box O
on O
a O
shelf O
in O
a O
store O
display O
. O

My O
opnion O
is O
that O
even O
alcohol O
is O
better O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
a O
pc O
for O
MANY O
years O
... O
in O
fact O
, O
my O
pc O
knowledge O
has O
definitely O
helped O
me O
advance O
in O
my O
banking O
career O
( O
technology O
and O
banking O
) O

Absolute O
ridiculously O
fast O

The O

we O
plugged O
our O
old O

adapter O
back O
in O
and O
it O
worked O
fine O
as O
always O
. O
) O

Plus O
a O
very O
nice O
metalic O
Canon O
logo O
. O

It O
protects O
what O
it O
needs O
to O
without O
adding O
much O
bulk O
. O

I O
selected O
" O
No O
" O
and O
pushed O
the O
o. O
k. O
button O
. O

and O
I O
know O
it O
will O
last O
her O
through O
high O
school O
and O
college O
and O
much O
farther O
into O
the O
future O
. O

Works O
great O
. O

There O
is O
one O
model O
up O
from O
this O
- O
ca O
n't O
remember O
if O
BT O
was O
included O

Renewed O
my O
garmins O
that O
had O
old O
and O
weak O
batteries O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
really O
sure O
how O
the O
i7 O
processor O
works O
, O
but O
it O
's O
basically O
overkill O
according O
to O
everyone O
I O
asked O
when O
buying O
it O
. O

Go O
through O
the O
RA O
process O
and O
return O
it O
for O
" O
repair O
" O
. O

I O
've O
used O
Mediabridge O
before O
, O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
them O
. O

Loading O
the O
Adobe O
suite O
and O
copying O
files O
from O
the O
main O
machine O
was O
a O
breeze O

the O
hi O
- O
cap O
SD O
card O
. O

Wonderful O
bag O
, O
and O
bonus O
of O
chargers O
inside O
made O
it O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Simple O

no O
problems O
whatsoever O

Lasted O
less O
than O
a O
month O

The O
item O
the O
Amazon O
had O
this O
bundled O
with O
( O
and O
for O
it O
to O
be O
used O
with O
) O
was O
a O
& O
# O
34;shipped O
from O
China&#34 O
; O
item O
and O
I O
just O
got O
it O
today O
.. O

If O
you O
're O
familiar O
with O
Case O
Logic O
products O
at O
all O
, O
then O
you O
'll O
immediately O
recognize O
this O
laptop O
case O
as O
one O
. O

I O
installed O
a O
Samsung O
250 O
GB O
SSD O
and O
it O
's O
lightning O
fast O
. O

And O
with O
a O
6 O
pack O
, O
I O
can O
now O
keep O
a O
cloth O
with O
each O
cell O
phone O
, O
kindle O
fire O
, O
and O
tablet O
that O
we O
have O
and O
always O
have O
a O
clean O
screen O
for O
work O
or O
play O
. O

Its O
ok O
for O
the O
price O
. O

If O
the O
price O
was O
close O
+ O
/- O

good O
luck O
in O
your O
shopping O
. O

I O
also O
decided O
to O
use O
the O
Arcsoft O
Total O
Media O
thingy O
that O
was O
part O
of O
the O
package O
. O

They O
're O
easy O
to O
charge O
and O
it O
stayed O
charged O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

USE O
IT O
EVERY O
DAY O
. O

The O
USB O
plug O
provides O
a O
pass O
- O
through O
.. O

but O
I O
guess O
all O
tablets O
these O
days O
suffer O
from O
it O
. O

In O
effect O
, O
you O
can O
have O
a O
few O
movies O
on O
a O
flash O
drive O
and O
watch O
them O
on O
the O
tablet O
or O
phone O
for O
a O
low O
price O
. O

; O
however O
I O
could O
see O
that O
my O
15&#34 O
; O
is O
pushing O
it O
. O

but O
the O
reader O
is O
still O
on O
and O
using O
up O
the O
battery O
, O
( O
just O
shut O
it O
off O
every O
time).3- O

Caution O
, O
pairing O
is O
not O
instantaneous O
. O

But O
this O
is O
what O
the O
keyboard O
dock O
does O
. O

Great O
case O
my O
Acer O
Chromebook O
C710 O
fits O
perfect O
. O

but O
it O
was O
a O
good O
quality O
at O
the O
time O

I O
doubt O
that O
any O
of O
these O
could O
replace O
my O
iMainGo2 O
! O

I O
also O
found O
plenty O
of O
space O
for O
the O
charger O
as O
well O
as O
pens O
, O
and O
other O
small O
accessories O
. O

The O
Escape O
key O
is O
odd O
because O
you O
have O
to O
push O
fn O
- O
Esc O
to O
make O
it O
work O
, O
unlike O
Apple O
's O
which O
lets O
you O
push O
the O
button O
by O
itself O
. O

Tip O
: O
when O
not O
shooting O
, O
keep O
zippers O
down O
and O
front O
when O
in O
crowds O
to O
make O
it O
harder O
for O
people O
to O
get O
in O
the O
bag O
without O
you O
noticing O
. O

This O
laptop O
fan O
mat O
works O
good O
, O
but O
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

It O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
charger O
, O
but O
the O
components O
are O
loose O
... O

The O
first O
two O
are O
clearly O
from O
someone O
with O
RooCase O
. O

It O
boots O
up O
in O
seconds O
and O
shoots O
from O
website O
to O
website O
with O
no O
delay O
. O

with O
the O
rebate O
offered O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
a O
fresh O
install O
of O
Windows O
. O

Does O
n't O
charge O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
. O

There O
are O
literally O
dozens O
of O
other O
examples O
. O

This O
item O
seemed O
a O
bit O
expensive O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
purchased O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
who O
watches O
Korean O
dramas O
on O
her O
iPad O
. O

Some O
websites O
are O
better O
than O
others O
, O
but O
if O
I O
have O
to O
scroll O
horizontally O
just O
to O
see O
a O
webpage O
, O
i O
hate O
that O
. O

I O
could O
not O
even O
send O
email O
or O
watch O
low O
quality O
streaming O
video O
with O
rates O
under O
300Kbps O
down O
and O
under O
15Kbps O
up O
! O
! O
! O

This O
was O
a O
definite O
minus O
for O
me O
, O
because O
it O
means O
I O
can O
only O
watch O
streaming O
videos O
while O
seated O
in O
front O
of O
my O
computer O
. O

The O
PC O
has O
to O
share O
my O
under O
- O
the O
- O
seat O
carry O
- O
on O
backpack O
with O
food O
, O
books O
, O
large O
headphones O
, O
art O
supplies O
, O
and O
various O
miscellanea O
. O

I O
also O
did O
not O
get O
any O
output O
indication O
that O
the O
HDMI O
was O
being O
seen O
. O

easy O
to O
install O
and O
very O
intuitive O
software O
. O

Since O
it O
's O
especially O
hard O
to O
find O
an O
adapter O
that O
works O
well O
with O
Linux O
, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
. O

What O
I O
mean O
is O
, O
when O
you O
're O
using O
it O
, O
it O
LOOKS O
and O
FEELS O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
if O
it O
is O
the O
parent O
tablet O
, O
or O
this O
keyboard O
, O
but O
most O
of O
the O
typing O
is O
slow O
and O
glitchy O
and O
the O
tablet O
freezes O
up O
often O
when O
trying O
to O
type O
for O
any O
length O
of O
time O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
the O
value O
on O
this O
MacBook O
cover O
. O

X. O
Bottom O
line O
: O

this O
unit O
works O
with O
USB O
port O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
able O
to O
help O
me O
to O
have O
a O
reliable O
projecting O
option O
to O
a O
external O
project O
. O

Against O
your O
back O
is O
another O
half O
- O
height O
pocket O
, O
perhaps O
for O
keys O
, O
wallet O
, O
cell O
phone O
or O
whatever O
. O

Good O
value O
for O
a O
keyboard O
and O
leather O
case O
together O
. O

All O
I O
needed O
was O
an O
OTG O
cable O
to O
connect O
this O
to O
my O
tablet O
. O

And O
they O
're O
nice O
looking O
, O
too O
! O

The O
bad O
thing O
is O
that O
this O
keyboard O
was O
n't O
made O
with O
purely O
OS O
X O
users O
in O
mind O
. O

Worked O
good O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
but O
after O
that O
it O
started O
to O
fall O
part O
. O

Everything O
else O
is O
already O
more O
than O
covered O
by O
others O
, O
so O
that O
's O
pretty O
much O
my O
review O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
really O
good O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
order O
to O
press O
a O
key O
, O
you O
have O
to O
press O
it O
a O
few O
millimeters O
below O
the O
lever O
of O
the O
material O
around O
the O
keys O
. O

The O
Asus O
could O
even O
fit O
in O
my O
jacket O
pocket O
. O

I O
personally O
assume O
if O
these O
keep O
failing O
at O
such O
a O
rapid O
rate O
that O
the O
other O
products O
they O
sell O
are O
worth O
the O
risk O
. O

( O
e. O
g. O
putting O
in O
your O
rolled O
up O
laptop O
cord O
/ O
power O
brick O
) O

I O
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
it O
was O
due O
to O
this O
adaptor O
or O
some O
firewall O
/ O
security O
setting O
was O
causing O
this O
issue O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
identify O
when O
I O
go O
through O
security O
and O
it O
never O
gets O
lost O
. O

it O
has O
the O
back O
wall O
to O
hold O
a O
stylus O
pen O
or O
other O
stuff O
, O
maybe O
a O
notebook O
of O
some O
kind O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
it O
was O
time O
to O
upgrade O
to O
3 O
GB O
myself O
. O

Picasa O
Web O
/ O
Google O
Plus O
have O
some O
kinks O
to O
work O
out O
, O
but O
Google O
is O
always O
improving O
their O
apps O
. O

It O
is O
actually O
a O
kind O
of O
bonus O
, O
since O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
type O
on O
at O
this O
angle O
, O
but O
other O
people O
may O
want O
to O
factor O
this O
ergonomic O
issue O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
own O
needs O
and O
preferences O
. O

I O
took O
one O
star O
off O
because O
the O
tolerance O
is O
n't O
as O
precise O
as O
the O
OEM O
battery O

Amazingly O
slow O
, O
just O
after O
unboxing O
, O
not O
even O
install O
any O
softwares O
. O

Now O
this O
would O
n't O
be O
a O
big O
deal O
if O
the O
rubber O
- O
banding O
only O
occurred O
on O
the O
tops O
and O
bottoms O
of O
webpages O
, O
but O
Apple O
has O
also O
decided O
to O
implement O
it O
on O
the O
SIDES O
of O
webpages O
. O

I O
plugged O
the O
new O
drive O
into O
the O
laptop O
and O
you O
could O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
, O
except O
there O
was O
more O
drive O
space O
. O

I O
got O
it O
on O
sale O
for O
$ O
49 O
. O

Happy O
watching O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
it O
's O
light O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
not O
regret O
waiting O
for O
the O
newer O
Seashell O
models O
. O

No O
problems O
with O
compatibility O
. O

After O
painfully O
composing O
it O
the O
first O
time O
( O
while O
squinting O
at O
this O
tiny O
screen O
) O
, O
the O
cursor O
developed O
a O
mind O
of O
its O
own O
and O
when O
I O
attempted O
to O
submit O
my O
revised O
review O
, O
it O
instead O
cancelled O
out O
of O
the O
edit O
screen O
. O

I O
've O
had O
a O
couple O
HP O
laptops O
that O
have O
burnt O
out O
on O
me O
after O
just O
a O
couple O
years O
. O

and O
you O
can O
charge O
through O
USB O
even O
it O
the O
notebook O
is O
n't O
on O
. O

It O
broke O
after O
a O
while O
of O
using O
it O
. O

I O
much O
prefer O
the O
black O
key O
tops O
to O
the O
clear O
because O
they O
get O
so O
cloudy O
over O
time O
. O

If O
you O
press O
Ctrl O
+ O
Alt O
+ O
Z O
you O
can O
toggle O
Spoken O
Feedback O
, O
which O
will O
read O
things O
out O
loud O
for O
you O
. O

Makes O
transferring O
files O
between O
my O
devices O
easy O
. O

For O
years O
I O
have O
used O
old O
old O
systems O
, O
other O
peoples O
throw O
aways O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
covered O
in O
the O
description O
, O
but O
it O
does O
have O
a O
backlit O
keyboard O

And O
I O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
. O

Although O
a O
comparable O
Macbook O
pro O
would O
cost O
almost O
$ O
1000 O
more O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
at O
the O
high O
end O
of O
the O
pc O
range O
in O
specs O
and O
price O
. O

and O
I O
am O
avoiding O
apps O
that O
download O
to O
the O
machine O
( O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
) O
. O

The O
sleeve O
is O
a O
little O
large O
for O
the O
15 O
" O
MBP O
( O
a O
good O
inch O
or O
so O
) O

I O
shopped O
around O
and O
found O
this O
one O
. O

Hopefully O
one O
day O
a O
new O
tv O
will O
come O
along O
that O
can O
handle O
games O
from O
the O
70 O
's O
. O

Most O
the O
real O
work O
I O
do O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
done O
on O
a O
PC O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
it O
runs O
cool O
, O
no O
problems O
yet O
. O

I O
have O
slim O
to O
medium O
fingers O
, O
yet O
i O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
pressing O
keys O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
you O
really O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
with O
this O
product O
. O

If O
you O
use O
your O
computer O
primarily O
for O
the O
Internet O
, O
do O
n't O
mind O
rather O
limited O
options O
for O
handling O
files O
when O
offline O
, O
and O
are O
n't O
tied O
down O
to O
Windows O
or O
Apple O
programs O
, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
a O
Chromebook O
as O
a O
primary O
or O
secondary O
computer O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
microfiber O
lens O
cleaning O
cloth O
that O
is O
included O
is O
almost O
worth O
the O
purchase O
price O
alone O
. O

I O
had O
this O
drive O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
one O
day O
it O
decides O
to O
stop O
working O
. O

You O
could O
easily O
make O
videos O
with O
this O
and O
then O
use O
higher O
end O
software O
to O
add O
fancy O
effects O
and O
more O
. O

The O
cases O
are O
all O
built O
with O
excellent O
quality O
and O
they O
stay O
locked O
on O
at O
all O
times O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
no O
- O
frills O
protection O
for O
your O
gadget O
that O
does O
the O
job O
right O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
option O
that O
you O
have O
. O

if O
you O
prefer O
) O
that O
is O
right O
on O
top O
and O
so O
easily O
accessible O
--- O
perhaps O
my O
favorite O
feature O
. O

Right O
now O
, O
I O
'm O
at O
84 O
% O
remaining O
battery O
power O
and O
the O
time O
estimate O
is O
at O
5 O
hours O
and O
14 O
minutes O
. O

So O
new O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
that O
I O
've O
basically O
ignored O
all O
news O
about O
it O
and O
only O
knew O
the O
basics O
about O
the O
strange O
, O
two O
- O
faced O
nature O
it O
had O
. O

Bluetooth O
devices O
all O
work O
fine O
. O

Installed O
the O
OS O
and O
Applications O
on O
this O
one O
and O
kept O
my O
files O
on O
the O
original O
drive O
. O

I O
have O
use O
lightroom O
off O
and O
on O
before O
, O
and O
never O
could O
see O
how O
it O
excels O
in O
any O
way O
. O

Hope O
that O
helps O
; O
enjoy!- O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
try O
it O
on O
for O
yourself O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
. O

I O
have O
the O
nine O
battery O
pack O
on O
it O

Everything O
is O
so O
well O
crafted O
. O

This O
at O
$ O
1370 O
is O
the O
lowest O
price O
on O
the O
internet O
right O
now O
, O
10/6/2008 O
with O
free O
shipping O
and O
no O
tax O
. O

change O
is O
hard O
. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
weird O
hearing O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
floppy O
drive O
again O
. O

I O
think O
the O
next O
flight O
I O
wo O
n't O
even O
take O
my O
charging O
cables O
because O
I O
always O
have O
more O
then O
enough O
for O
the O
entire O
trip O
and O
the O
flight O
back O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
since O
they O
do O
nt O
supply O
the O
3 O
. O
5 O
to O
5 O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
keep O
it O
and O
try O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

I O
did O
not O
need O
high O
- O
end O
graphics O
for O
gaming O
, O
high O
- O
end O
sound O
, O
or O
a O
huge O
screen O
( O
not O
portable O
, O
kills O
battery).This O
ASUS O
meets O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O

The O
touch O
pad O
is O
built O
into O
the O
computer O
top O
surface O
below O
the O
keyboard O
. O

Of O
course O
fingerprints O
will O
still O
be O
visible O
. O

I O
got O
to O
where O
I O
only O
wanted O
to O
capture O
and O
do O
all O
my O
editing O
etc O
. O

THis O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

The O
major O
down O
side O
is O
that O
the O
HDMI O
plug O
on O
the O
montior O
is O
faulty O
. O

Just O
know O
that O
if O
you O
're O
planning O
to O
upgrade O
your O
Macbook O
13 O
" O
, O
keep O
one O
of O
the O
original O
1 O
GB O
sticks O
. O

3 O
" O
1600x900 O
LED O
edge O
lit O
LCD O
which O
is O
much O
better O
than O
what O
you O
usually O
get O
for O
a O
laptop O
with O
a O
price O
like O
this O
. O

Insert O
this O
adapter O
into O
a O
USB O
slot O
on O
your O
computer4 O
. O

Honestly O
I O
'd O
give O
the O
Macbook O
Air O
5 O
stars O
for O
just O
simply O
surviving O
a O
year O
with O
my O
mom O
. O

THIS O
CASE O
IS O
PERFECT O
. O

It O
's O
been O
compared O
to O
a O
sports O
car O
, O
since O
its O
about O
as O
thick O
as O
a O
USB O
port O
towards O
the O
front O
, O
but O
slopes O
up O
slightly O
to O
the O
rear O
. O

I O
mean O
with O
such O
a O
great O
price O
its O
hard O
not O
go O
with O
this O
case O
. O

Not O
too O
sharp O
or O
hollow O
, O
voices O
are O
clear O
and O
not O
muddled+ O

is O
a O
light O
, O
comfortable O
device O
that O
I O
'm O
using O
with O
my O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
laptop O
. O

if O
you O
have O
a O
tight O
usb O
port O
to O
push O
into O
( O
you O
learn O
to O
hold O
the O
sides O
awkwardly O
to O
prevent O
this O
) O
. O

I O
think O
it O
worth O
the O
selling O
price O
all O
the O
way O
! O
! O

Due O
to O
their O
cutting O
corner O
ways O
to O
maximize O
profit O
I O
was O
sold O
a O
lemon O
. O

It O
clips O
on O
secure O
and O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
Mac O
whatsoever O
, O
you O
can O
still O
close O
it O
and O
use O
it O
normally O
. O

I O
would O
definetly O
recommend O
this O
fan O
, O
c'mon O
it O
's O
only O
like O

My O
son O
dropped O
his O
phone O
on O
his O
laptop O
and O
broke O
the O
screen O
. O

so O
I O
decided O
to O
skip O
the O
installation O
cd O
and O
go O
directly O
to O
the O
music O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
, O
compared O
specifications O
, O
and O
came O
down O
to O
about O
4 O
laptops O
. O

The O
actual O
product O
does O
NOT O
have O
those O
compartments O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
recommend O
the O
NotePal O
U2 O
Cooling O
Pad O
as O
an O
affordable O
, O
practical O
way O
to O
cool O
off O
your O
laptop O
. O

They O
just O
stuck O
a O
piece O
of O
plastic O
in O
the O
hole O
that O
kinda O
sorta O
matches O
. O

It O
is O
a O
gift O
for O
a O
friend O
and O
it O
is O
actually O
a O
very O
nice O
color O
. O

More O
googling O
suggested O
installing O
the O
latest O
Atheros O
chipset O
drivers O
for O
the O
card O
( O
version O

can O
or O
could O
anyone O
ask O
for O
. O

the O
grill O
with O
the O
red O
is O
very O
cool O
, O
but O
too O
bad O
the O
buttons O
are O
so O
frustrating O
, O
and O
that O
the O
speaker O
itself O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
separate O
itself O
from O
the O
2 O
, O
765 O
other O
BT O
speakers O
out O
there O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
awesome O
bag O
. O

I O
took O
the O
speaker O
out O
of O
it O
's O
stand O
to O
make O
it O
lower O
and O
is O
easily O
done O
and O
looks O
fine O
it O
you O
want O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
have O
used O
this O
converter O
flawlessly O
for O
quite O
a O
few O
hours O
catching O
up O
on O
my O
sporadically O
missed O
Bones O
episodes O
via O
Netflix O
. O

The O
zipper O
pull O

broke O
shortly O
after O
the O
purchase O

and O
it O
was O
returned O
to O

I O
travel O
with O
my O

in O
it O
wherever O
I O
go O
now O
. O

Other O
cables O
do O
n't O
have O
this O
problem O
. O

Frame O
skipping O
and O
audio O
cuts O
, O
will O
be O
totally O
a O
mess O
. O

They O
both O
turn O
on O
and O
off O
with O
the O
engine O
, O
but O
this O
one O
picks O
up O
on O

It O
would O
not O

at O
all O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
, O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
.................. O

Not O
an O
expensive O
piece O
of O
equipment O
but O
it O
works O
perfectly O
with O
my O
Panasonic O
Lumix O
GH2 O
. O

Neither O
you O
would O
want O
any O
laptop O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

It O
also O
feels O
good O
in O
the O
hand O
. O

I O
chose O
red O
and O
when O
it O
arrived O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
lovely O
burgundy O
- O
red O
shade O
that O
seems O
to O
glow O
with O
an O
aesthetic O
sheen O
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
paint O
job O
on O
a O
shiny O
, O
high O
- O
priced O
automobile O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
use O
this O
device O
with O
an O
iPod O
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
bulky O
, O
but O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O

I O
would O
purchase O
from O
this O
seller O
again O
without O
hesitation O
. O

The O
Chromebook O
excels O
in O
everything O
I O
have O
asked O
of O
it O
. O

High O
power O
setting O
for O
a O
hair O
dryer O
or O
curling O
iron O
motivated O
my O
purchase O
, O
but O
my O
wife O
said O
her O
curling O
irion O
did O
n't O
get O
as O
hot O
as O
at O
home O
. O

8 O
64-bit O

( O
easily O
obtained O
) O
and O
just O
install O
it O
. O

This O
falls O
out O
of O
my O
HP O
laptop O
. O

and O
provides O
extra O
protection O
. O

If O
you O
wait O
a O
year O
or O
more O
, O
you O
might O
get O
such O
changes O
as O
awesome O
Liquid O

I O
was O
upset O
when O
my O
husband O
called O
me O
from O
Iraq O
to O
let O
me O
know O
his O
laptop O
cord O
had O
shorted O
. O

Anyway O
, O
problem O
solved O
! O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
gotten O
an O
adapter O
( O
or O
adapter O
cable O
) O
yet O
. O

I O
attached O
the O
docking O
station O
to O
my O
computer O

Colors O
are O
clear O
and O
very O
sharp O
. O

On O
the O
bright O
side O
, O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
no O
data O
reliability O
problems O
( O
yet O
-- O
again O
, O
it O
has O
been O
less O
than O
one O
month O
) O
. O

The O
bluetooth O
pairs O
easily O
with O
the O
tablet O
, O
following O
the O
directions O
included O
. O

Either O
way O
a O
good O
cable O
, O
but O
Not O
for O
heavy O
use O

est&aacute;n O
limitas O
unas O

If O
you O
follow O
the O
installation O
instruction O
, O
you O
can O
easily O
get O
it O
to O
work O
in O
5 O
minutes O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
you O
probably O
know O
if O
the O
cons O
are O
going O
to O
be O
deal O
- O
breakers O
for O
you O
, O
and O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
that O
way O
and O
are O
n't O
scared O
off O
by O
the O
price O
, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
. O

YOU O
ORDER O
THE O
CORRECT O
ONE O
;) O

It O
's O
not O
available O
on O
flights O
, O
and O
there O
is O
not O
enough O
RAM O
in O
this O
unit O
16 O
GB O
to O
keep O
movies O
. O

I O
'm O
gon O
na O
have O
to O
use O
tape O
. O

So O
I O
ordered O
this O
laptop O
cooler O
to O
help O
cool O
my O
laptop O
when O
I O
play O
games O
or O
watch O
videos O
on O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
always O
amused O
by O
the O
critical O
comments O
regarding O
computers O
. O

In O
closing O
, O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
the O
performance O
or O
value O
of O
this O
thing O
will O
be O
over O
time O
. O

With O
the O
slide O
out O
tray O
on O
this O
model O
, O
it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
difficult O
to O
load O
and O
unload O
DVDs O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Cintiq O
Companion O
looks O
great O
. O

Some O
people O
posted O
that O
the O
LED O
's O
come O
on O
by O
them O
selves O
or O
in O
low O
light O
, O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
there O
is O
a O
switch O
/ O
slider O
on O
the O
USB O
cord O
that O
lets O
you O
increase O
or O
decrease O
the O
light O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
this O
little O
speaker O
does O
indeed O
warrant O
five O
stars O
, O
considering O
its O
size O
and O
price O
. O

Great O
price O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
flash O
drives O
. O

I O
think O
I O
will O
make O
for O
a O
while O
( O
even O
a O
better O
buy O
than O
the O
$ O

) O
. O

Long O
story O
short O
, O
it O
is O
cheap O
and O
works O
, O
but O
not O
like O
a O
factory O
replacement O
. O

After O
plugging O
in O
the O
tuner O
, O
I O
simply O
ran O
the O
set O
- O
up O
wizard O
in O
Windows O
Media O
Center O
and O
before O
long O
I O
was O
watching O
live O
TV O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
ready O
to O
order O
another O
pkg O
because O
I O
like O
having O
them O
scattered O
about O
the O
house O
( O
and O
in O
my O
vehicle O
) O
where O
they O
'll O
always O
be O
handy O

My O

2 O

just O

enough O
. O

No O
more O
than O
I O
type O
, O
adding O
the O
extra O
bulk O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O

I O
realize O
this O
small O
Acer O
is O
not O
intended O
to O
be O
a O
full O

on O

but O
the O

do O
take O

used O

, O
especially O
if O
you O
use O
a O
standard O

so O
my O

Towards O

my O

I O
bought O
two O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
there O
is O
a O
warranty O
on O
this O
this O
charger O
, O
but O
since O
it O
is O
an O
OEM O

I O
'd O
expect O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
warranty O

are O
known O
for O

It O
's O
not O
bad O
, O
considering O
that O
it O
's O
not O
expensive O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
on O

would O
hope O

would O
last O
at O

a O

that O

really O
good O
news O

not O
bad O

about O

One O
thing O
that O
was O

me O
was O
when O
the O

was O
displaying O

I O
find O
that O
I O
like O

better O
in O

and O
the O

I O
listen O
to O
the O
sound O
that O
comes O
through O

I O
play O

resolution O
display O
to O
work O
with O
is O
the O
single O
most O
important O
requirement O
for O
me O
. O

I O
've O
also O
used O
it O
to O
hold O
/ O
organize O
release O
forms O
when O
on O
shoots O
as O
it O
nicely O
holds O
paper O
/ O
folders/13inch O
laptops O
without O
any O
problem O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
picky O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
also O
a O
pitiful O
cheapskate O
, O
so O

It O
stayed O
on O
the O
car O
almost O
a O
mile O
before O
a O
bump O
, O
boom O
and O
then O
remembered O
my O
laptop O
. O

If O
you O
are O
playing O
music O
/ O
games O
/ O
videos O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
will O
notice O
it O
, O
and O
when O
the O
volume O
levels O
increase O
above O
a O
whisper O
you O
ca O
n't O
hear O
the O
noises O
at O
all O
. O

As O
with O
most O
devices O
, O
this O
all O
depends O
on O
how O
you O
use O
it O
but O
those O
are O
great O
numbers O
in O
themselves O
. O

As O
a O
desktop O
hub O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
shift O
as O
I O
move O
the O
mouse O
. O

Well O
, O
he O
was O
right O
. O

I O
was O
skeptical O
of O
getting O
a O
case O
that O
was O
n't O
leather O
because O
I O
thought O
it O
might O
make O
it O
look O
cheap O
. O

keeping O
my O
lappy O
as O
new O
as O
first O
day O
i O
touched O
it O
. O

Just O
the O
case O
for O
an O
upcoming O
trip O
, O
where O
airline O
will O
count O
it O
as O
a O
& O
# O
34;personal O
item.&#34 O
; O

I O
found O
myself O
repeatedly O
looking O
at O
the O
display O
very O
closely O
to O
see O
if O
the O
sharpness O
was O
as O
bad O
as O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
when O
looking O
from O
a O
regular O
distance O
. O

i O
recommend O
it O
for O
anyone O
with O
carpal O
tunnel O
and O
owning O
a O
laptop O

Then O
I O
found O
this O
one O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

Holds O
many O
different O
sizes O
of O
SD O
cards O
and O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
carry O
around O
with O
you O
. O

In O
the O
main O
compartment O
of O
the O
backpack O
I O
carried O
my O
other O
lenses O
and O
all O
my O
other O
assorted O
camera O
gear O
. O

I O
closed O
the O
case O
up O
, O
and O
put O
the O
two O
little O
covers O
back O
on O
. O

Since O
most O
users O
will O
use O
this O
with O
a O
laptop O
, O
the O
software O
disc O
is O
pretty O
useless O
. O

I O
even O
use O
it O
outside O
my O
house O
without O
an O
issue O
. O

Definite O
improvement O
over O
my O
laptop O
's O
speaker O
. O

I O
could O
do O
email O
in O
rooms O
of O
the O
house O
that O
I O
could O
not O
before O
however O
live O
streaming O
( O
Netflix O
) O
still O
not O
available O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
new O
( O
2011 O
) O
21 O
. O

Downside O
is O
sand O
gets O
stuck O
in O
the O
speaker O
holes O
and O

Got O
this O
at O
a O
great O
price O
plus O
free O
shipping O
and O
received O
it O
a O
week O
ahead O
of O
the O
scheduled O
delivery O
. O

Item O
is O
as O
described O
, O
it O
works O
great O
so O
far O
( O
after O
a O
few O
months O
) O
odd O
shape O
is O
a O
little O
awkward O
, O
but O
worth O
it O
for O
functionality O

What O
else O
do O
you O
want O
it O
to O
do O
? O

This O
cable O
solved O
this O
problem O
for O
me O
. O

It O
is O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
use O
and O
I O
'm O
pleased O
with O
the O
functions O
that O
it O
performs O
. O

Make O
use O
of O
the O
Mini O
- O
Sd O
card O
port O
. O

Will O
fit O
a O
15 O
or O
17&#34 O
; O
laptop O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
elected O
to O
let O
it O
run O
its O
course O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
finally O
bought O
this O
battery O

and O
it O
has O
always O
worked O
perfectly O

Brief O
Opening O
Description O
telling O
what O
drew O
you O
to O
this O
particular O
product O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
speaker O
problems O
or O
hinge O
problems O
that O
some O
people O
have O
had O
. O

It O
works O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
USB2 O
. O
0 O
and O
does O
n't O
support O
a O
lot O
of O
devices O
. O

I O
have O
no O
issues O
with O
build O
quality O
. O

I O
own O
a O
number O
of O
Anker O
products O
, O
and O
while O
I O
have O
had O
zero O
issues O
with O
any O
of O
them O
to O
date O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
I O
would O
get O
any O
issue O
resolved O
with O
a O
simple O
phone O
call O
to O
Anker O
tech O
support O
. O

So O
far O
I O
successfully O
been O
able O
to O
store O
and O
play O
160 O
of O
my O
favorite O
mp3 O
music O
files O
, O
Download/ O
install O
and O
store O
games O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
save O
and O
load O
game O
data O
on O
this O
memory O
chip O
successfully O
multiple O
times O
. O

And O
all O
the O
reviews O
of O
actual O
third O
- O
party O
chargers O
looked O
very O
hit O
- O
or O
- O
miss O
( O
more O
miss O
than O
hit O
) O
. O

I O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
pay O
a O
few O
more O
bucks O
for O
a O
" O
break O
- O
away O
" O
breakout O
connector O
( O
with O
two O
pig O
- O
tailed O
female O
USB O
sockets O
, O
which O
would O
not O
protrude O
so O
obstructionately O
) O
and O
so O
should O
everyone O
else O
. O

It O
feels O
solid O
, O
and O
it O
feels O
( O
and O
looks O
) O
like O
a O
traditional O
leather O
folio O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Maybe O
that O
's O
Windows O
sloppiness O
, O
and O

Also O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
Internet O
Explorer O
interface O
in O
Win O
8 O
, O
but O
again O
, O
I O
can O
use O
the O
traditional O
interface O
very O
easily O
. O

It O
was O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
Windows O
tries O
to O
be O
clever O
and O
remember O
different O
combinations O
of O
monitors O
so O
that O
if O
you O
have O
a O
different O
one O
at O
the O
office O
, O
and O
two O
different O
setups O
at O
home O
, O
say O
. O

BUT O
, O
the O
screensaver O
does O
n't O
work O
, O

Was O
very O
disappointed O
in O
the O
fit O
of O
this O
adapter O
. O

This O
product O
did O
the O
trick O
. O

Had O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
as O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
it O
to O
ruin O
our O
electronics O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
we O
get O
a O
Micro O
SD O
Card O

Amazing O
design O
! O

Needed O
it O
to O
hook O
up O
to O
a O
Pioneer O
turntable O
in O
lieu O
of O
an O
amp O
. O

That O
immediately O
got O
them O
talking O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
breaking O
all O
of O
my O
other O
wireless O
links O
( O
two O
computers O
and O
a O
Wii O
) O
. O

it O
and O
updated O
and O
installed O
/ O
reinstalled O
drivers O
, O
went O
into O
my O
device O
manager O
making O
sure O
my O
computer O
saw O
it O
which O
it O
did O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
I O
listen O
to O
podcasts O
when O
exercising O
and O
bought O
the O
Otterbox O
and O
Nano O
specifically O
to O
be O
able O
to O
jump O
back O
to O
the O
right O
place O
within O
the O
podcast O
( O
like O
where O
I O
last O
left O
off O
) O
on O
the O
fly O
, O
and O
with O
ease O
. O

It O
came O
on O
time O
, O
fit O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
memory O
. O

I O
already O
reviewed O
one O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
about O
this O
one O

When O
you O
bought O
this O
new O
trent O
battery O
you O
will O
give O
a O
second O
air O
to O
your O
laptop O
, O
at O
first O
sight O
you O
will O
find O
that O
this O
battery O
could O
be O
used O
for O
more O
than O
3 O
hours O
and O
it O
is O
just O
great O
, O
i O
reccomend O
this O
, O
only O
thing O

I O
also O
have O
these O
problems O
with O
other O
Bluetooth O
equipment O
. O

I O
normally O
carried O
one O
or O
the O
other O
around O
in O
a O
sleeve O
; O
this O
is O
a O
perfect O
replacement O
. O

Bewear O

for O
some O
reason O
cheaper O
flash O
drives O
are O
not O
always O
recognized O
on O
all O

, O
but O
a O
good O

It O
has O
the O
same O
customizable O

as O
the O
keys O

and O
will O
display O

if O
the O

I O
am O

a O
B250-XT+ O
Blueparrot O
headset O
for O
voice O
chat O
, O
using O
Skype O

Yahoo O
Messenger O
. O

It O
was O
delivered O
on O
time O
and O
works O
good O
so O
far O
bought O
one O
bout O
18 O
months O
ago O
and O
worked O
good O
till O
our O
puppy O
chewed O
it O
up O

A O
big O
advantage O
to O
video O
on O
the O
card O
is O
there O
are O
NO O
MOVING O
PARTS O
, O

I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
have O
if O
i O
had O
seen O
those O
reviews O
before O
making O
my O
purchase O
. O

No O
way O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
wait O
to O
get O
the O
digital O
and O
HD O
channels O
. O

The O
Video O
Pack O
350 O
AW O
is O
an O
updated O
version O
of O
the O
Fastpack O
350 O
but O
with O
an O
AW O
Cover O
and O
a O
tripod O
mount O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
test O
and O
see O
how O
bad O
the O
graininess O
is O
on O
the O
XPS O

but O
my O
filter O
had O
a O
1-inch O
semicircular O
notch O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
top O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
it O
has O
no O
cons O
. O

I O
next O
installed O
the O
WPC54GX4 O
card O
in O
the O
PCMIA O
slot O
in O
my O
laptop O
. O

thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
such O
a O
grate O
product O
. O

A O
great O
addition O
to O
a O
computer O
or O
laptop O
. O

If O
you O
buy O
the O
InnoTab O
, O
you O
really O
need O
to O
buy O
this O
product O
too O
. O

It O
might O
be O
hardware O
- O
related O
, O
such O
as O
a O
fan O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

The O
connection O
seems O
fine O
, O
and O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
the O
transmitter O
. O

After O
week O
or O
so O
the O
battery O
charges O
up O
and O
holds O
the O
charge O
well O
. O

These O
would O
not O
allow O
transfer O
of O
data O
to O
computer O
. O

Looks O
almost O
indentical O
to O
the O
one O
I O
received O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
appreciate O
the O
water O
bottle O
holder O
as O
well O
. O

Comes O
out O
looking O
perfectly O
new O
. O

The O
fans O
and O
outer O
holes O
gather O
dust O
over O
time O
; O
just O
clean O
it O
with O
compressed O
air- O

The O
sound O
is O
not O
room O
- O
filling O
by O
any O
means O
, O
lets O
not O
kid O
ourselves O
, O
but O
it O
is O
more O
than O
adequate O
for O
listening O
to O
music O
at O
your O
laptop O
computer O
at O
your O
desk O
within O
3 O
- O
5 O
feet O
from O
your O
ears O
. O

and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

The O
Macbook O
shows O
this O
battery O
as O
being O
a O
4234mAh O
battery O
, O
so O
nowhere O
close O
to O
what O
the O
battery O
is O
being O
sold O
as O
. O

My O
overall O
impression O
of O
this O
cover O
is O
that O
its O
quality O
is O
appropriate O
to O
the O
price O
- O
point O
relative O
to O
the O
other O
covers O
you O
can O
find O
on O
the O
market O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
would O
get O
uncomfortable O
after O
a O
while O
though O
. O

The O
two O
WLI O
- O
UC O
- O
GN O
are O
boxed O
back O
up O
, O
sitting O
in O
the O
car O
for O
me O
to O
take O
back O
to O
Microcenter O
when O
I O
get O
off O
work O
. O

I O
'm O
beginning O
to O
notice O
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
the O
trackpad O
may O
be O
needing O
a O
replacement O
soon O
. O

com O
, O
got O
my O
daughter O
to O
do O
the O
same O
and O
voila O
, O
we O
were O
staring O
at O
each O
other O
face O
to O
face O
and O
chatting O
in O
real O
time O
. O

I O
will O
update O
this O
review O
in O
case O

No O
lag O
while O
in O
bluetooth O
connection O
, O
and O
all O
keys O
work O
, O
even O
the O
music O
and O
volume O
buttons O
( O
great O
while O
working O
at O
my O
desk O
with O
the O
phone O
docked O
, O
and O
not O
having O
to O
go O
into O
submenus O
to O
change O
tracks).Thinking O
about O
ordering O
a O
second O
for O
home O
. O

I O
am O
quite O
impressed O
and O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
who O
likes O
to O
take O
more O
than O
an O
IPad O
with O
them O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
away O
from O
home O
base O
, O
or O
as O
a O
sleeve O
in O
a O
larger O
travel O
back O
on O
longer O
trips O
. O

Downgrade O
for O
the O
stand O
and O
the O
tiny O
buttons O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
addition O
to O
an O
old O
laptop O
that O
has O
worked O
very O
well O
for O
a O
few O
years O
. O

The O
reviewer O
who O
complained O
about O
this O
could O
have O
spent O
about O
2 O
minutes O
and O
fixed O
this O
issue O
. O

i O
love O
it O
, O
it O
keeps O
my O
mac O
clean O
and O
protected O
. O

For O
a O
really O
significant O
speed O
boost O
, O
I O
'd O
recommend O
upgrading O
to O
an O
SSD O
. O

I O
wish O
Mediabridge O
would O
make O
the O
grey O
backshell O
around O
the O
micro O
plug O
a O
little O
smaller O
( O
and O
flatter O
) O
so O
the O
plug O
would O
fit O
through O
the O
case O
on O
a O
phone O
. O

Not O
sure O
how O
to O
address O
this O
, O
but O
maybe O
just O
put O
everything O
in O
a O
big O
ziplock O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

NO O
BATTERY O
required O
. O

This O
television O
is O
a O
solid O
value O
, O
with O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
care O
put O
into O
its O
design O
, O
( O
stand O
, O
light O
, O
input O
options O
) O
and O
a O
superior O
image O
to O
most O
HD O
sets O
I O
have O
seen O
. O

I O
baught O
this O
netbook O
for O
my O
son O
It O
performs O
very O
good O
, O
fast O
internet O
navigation O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
monitor O
's O
max O
resolution O
is O
a O
little O
low O
( O
1366 O

If O
I O
watch O
movies O
online O
on O
YouTube O
, O
Hulu O
, O
or O
NetFlix O

I O
'm O
using O
Windows O
XP O
and O
inserted O
the O
dongle O
in O
a O
free O
USB O
port O
and O
was O
automatically O
recognized O
by O

installed O

Worked O
better O
with O
keeping O
my O
netbook O
cooler O
but O
still O
worked O
well O
with O
keeping O
my O
usual O
laptop O
cool O
when O
it O
would O
sometimes O
die O
from O
overheating O
while O
playing O
games O

Would O
recommend O
to O
a O
friend O

If O
I O
ever O
have O
to O
buy O
another O
keyboard O
I O
will O
definitely O
be O
buying O
from O
this O
company O
again O
. O

I O
plug O
this O
Hub O
into O
the O
full O
size O
USB O
port O
in O
the O
keyboard O
enclosure O
, O
and O
now O
have O
increased O
the O
number O
of O
USB O
ports O
by O

I O
started O
with O
the O
15 O
" O
models O
some O
years O
ago O
but O
found O
out O
they O
were O
too O
heavy O
to O
take O
on O
my O
commute O
to O
work O
. O

The O
package O
was O
delivered O
on O
March O
15 O
, O
1 O

, O
1 O
week O
and O
1 O
day O
after O
shipping O
( O
ordered O
with O
Standard O
shipping O

, O
paid O
almost O
$ O
10 O

about O

hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
longer O
as O
well O
. O

Again O
, O
why O
i O
did O
n't O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
when O
I O
first O
bought O
my O
laptop O
, O
I O
'll O
never O
know O
. O

The O
brightness O
is O
not O
at O
all O
uniform O
between O
the O
center O
and O
edges O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
give O
it O
two O
thumbs O
down O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
waited O
for O
this O
purchase O
, O
because O
it O
's O
perfect O
. O

I O
would O
give O
this O
laptop O
a O
4 O
1/2 O
stars O
, O
but O
since O
Amazon O
only O
allows O
whole O
numbers O
I O
have O
to O
steer O
to O
the O
4 O
start O
mark O

zippy O
) O

My O
only O
complaint O
when O
the O
lid O
is O
closed O
, O
it O
goes O
into O
sleep O
mode O
and O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
have O
to O
reboot O
when O
you O
open O
the O
lid O
. O

This O
package O
comprises O
theKingston O
Memory O
Card O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
's O
going O
to O
work O
, O
but O
I O
've O
just O
purchased O
the O
3 O
. O
5 O
mm O
StereoTRRS O
4-Pole O
M O
to O
TRS O
Jack O
Microphone O
to O
iPhone O
Adapter O
. O

It O
was O
very O
random O
how O
it O
would O
work O
. O

My O
one O
major O
gripe O
is O
the O
trackpad O
. O

but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
. O

And O
, O
if O
you O
are O
n't O
comfortable O
dealing O
with O
IDE O
connectors O
( O
it O
's O
not O
necessarily O
obvious O
which O
way O
is O
up O
) O
, O
the O
lack O
of O
documentation O
could O
be O
a O
problem O
for O
you O
. O

I O
lost O
it O
when O
my O
luggage O
got O
lost O
. O

The O
touchpad O
feels O
identical O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
bamboo O
palm O
rest O
, O
and O
is O
very O
smooth O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
use O
the O
power O
strip O
after O
it O
was O
directly O
plugged O
into O
a O
220v O
adapter O
. O

You O
can O
get O
this O
device O
in O
a O
range O
of O
colors O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
had O
many O
replacement O
chargers O
and O
a O
/ O
c O
adapters O
, O
but O
most O
WON'T O
charge O
my O
Dell O
1525 O
. O

The O
cable O
lock O
secures O
the O
ThinkPad O
Mini O
Dock O
Plus O
Series O
3 O
to O
the O
workspace O
( O
desk O
, O
table O
, O
pole O
, O
furniture O
, O
wall O
) O
. O

So O
small O
, O
easy O
to O
carry O
from O
one O
room O
/ O
place O
to O
another O
! O

THE O
SHIPPING O
WAS O
FAST O
AND O
WAS O

I O
carry O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
some O
files O
, O
office O
stuff O
, O
etc O
. O

Without O
exaggerating O
, O
when O
the O
fan O
comes O
on O
, O
it O
actually O
sounds O
like O
the O
jet O
whine O
you O
'd O
expect O
from O
a O
plane O
. O

I O
bought O
two O
of O
these O
, O
one O
for O
a O
Windows O
XP O
machine O
and O
another O
for O
a O
Windows O
8 O
. O
1 O
machine O
. O

Will O
try O
again O
, O
maybe O
the O
newer O
10 O
" O
model O
. O

The O
biege O
color O
of O
the O
case O
matches O
the O
white O
Kindle O
nicely O
. O

I O
had O
my O
wife O
try O
it O
with O
same O
results O
. O

It O
's O
not O
worth O
the O
shipping O
and O
hassle O
to O
return O
this O
product O
for O
that O
one O
accessory O
but O
is O
a O
disappointment O
. O

I O
keep O
it O
packed O
. O

GB O
iSSD O
compare O
to O
traditional O
hard O
drive O
by O
itself O

In O
practical O
use O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
this O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
because O
I O
'm O
getting O
the O
same O
extended O
runtime O
that O
I O
got O
on O
earlier O
MacBook O
Pros O
with O
2 O
battery O
swaps O
. O

It O
did O
take O
a O
while O
for O
my O
mom O
to O
get O
used O
to O
being O
limited O
to O
basically O
the O
Chrome O
browser O
, O
but O
after O
learning O
the O
ins O
and O
outs O
of O
Google O
Drive O
to O
replace O
Microsoft O
, O
she O
is O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
inexpensive O
sleeve O
for O
net O
books O
and O
ipad O
. O

Its O
paired O
with O
a O
Wingard O
MS2000 O
omnidirectional O
antenna O
( O
pre O
amp'd O
) O
and O
I O
live O
approx O
15 O
miles O
from O
three O
banks O
of O
TV O
Towers O
putting O
out O
the O
signal O
. O

None O
of O
the O
ones O
you O
see O
will O
work O
. O

You O
can O
tweak O
a O
few O
things O
on O
Win8 O
and O
learn O
a O
few O
quick O
keyboard O
shortcuts O
and O
life O
is O
much O
better O
. O

The O
stickers O
are O
awesome O
! O

It O
does O
n't O
hold O
a O
charge O
well O
and O
does O
n't O
play O
long O
between O
charges O
. O

I O
like O
my O
keyboard O
to O
be O
very O
close O
to O
my O
legs O
. O

I O
'm O
completely O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

They O
were O
both O
good O
and O
bad O
. O

Surprisingly O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
as O
cheap O
as O
its O
price O
tag O
. O

Come O
on O
Sony O
, O
so O
perfect O
in O
every O
other O
way O
! O

) O
Bluetooth O
has O
n't O
been O
quite O
as O
seamless O
as O
I O
'd O
like O
. O

It O
came O
with O
Vista O
, O
a O
nightmare O
, O
but O
upgrading O
to O
Windows O
7 O
make O
a O
big O
difference O
. O

The O
enclosure O
looks O
nice O
, O
maybe O
a O
bit O
cheap O
but O
nice O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
about O
to O
order O
a O
second O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

The O
trackpad O
on O
the O
DELL O
Mini-10 O
drove O
me O
NUTS O
. O

It O
looks O
cheap O
. O

The O
battery O
has O
a O
good O
life O
and O
the O
keyboard O
fully O
supports O
the O
battery O
of O
the O
tablet O
. O

and O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
10 O
- O
15 O
min O
reboot O
procedure O
that O
was O
irritating O
. O

It O
is O
light O
, O
pulls O
just O
a O
little O
less O
power O
than O
the O
original O
adapter O
, O
which O
I O
keep O
at O
home O
while O
I O
use O
this O
at O
work O
. O

This O
little O
gem O
works O
great O
in O
everything O
I O
've O
tried O
it O
in O
. O

Have O
you O
guys O
pay O
attention O
when O
the O
computer O
is O
booting O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
'm O
converting O
DVI O
to O
VGA O
to O
HDMI O
that O
's O
causing O
the O
issues O
. O

It O
gives O
it O
a O
nice O
ca O
nt O
while O
you O
are O
working O
on O
it O

Once O
on O
the O
product O
page O
, O
everything O
a O
person O
could O
possibly O
need O
was O
listed O
and O
in O
surprisingly O
easy O
to O
read O
fashion O
( O
actually O
this O
was O
way O
better O
than O
the O
fold O
up O
instruction O
sheet O
in O
the O
box O
, O
which O
was O
almost O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
read O
- O
the O
paragraphs O
went O
across O
the O
top O
panel O
first O
, O
then O
went O
down O
to O
the O
bottom O
panel O
, O
and O
then O
continued O
on O
the O
back O
; O
I O
got O
lost O
several O
times O
between O
PC O
, O
Mac O
, O
and O
configuration O
instructions O
) O
. O

it O
really O
has O
no O
business O
being O
that O
slow O
. O
) O

I O
love O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
place O
to O
put O
a O
card O
so O
I O
can O
carry O
my O
music O
with O
me O
. O

But O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
humanity O
who O
would O
like O
a O
foolproof O
method O
of O
video O
recording O
, O
Mino O
more O
than O
fits O
the O
bill O
with O
an O
almost O
zero O
learning O
curve O
! O

The O
program O
and O
apps O
are O
very O
responsive O
without O
any O
lag O
whatsoever O
. O

you O
can O
use O
the O
plug O
in O
adapter O
or O
even O
better O
just O
put O
in O
1 O
tripple O
A O
battery O
. O

And O
the O
high O
notes O
are O
accurate O
. O

For O
business O
use O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
seen O
a O
fingerprint O
scanner O
, O
but O
no O
loss O
. O

There O
is O
enough O
room O
for O
cords O
. O

My O
desktop O
burned O
through O
two O
other O
power O
supplies O
. O

Are O
hotels O
worried O
we O
'll O
use O
too O
much O
electricity O
? O
) O

Perhaps O
there O
is O
a O
conflict O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
touch O
macs O
. O

Bought O
this O
to O
try O
and O
trouble O
shoot O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
my O
computer O
, O
I O
left O
my O
laptop O
in O
my O
trunk O
for O
about O
a O
week O
and O
it O
killed O
my O
old O
stock O
battery O
. O

With O
a O
laptop O
, O
forget O
it O
. O

so O
you O
end O
up O
running O
on O
the O
battery O
without O
knowing O
it O
. O

My O
understanding O
( O
from O
reading O
review O
after O
review O
) O
was O
that O
it O
would O
& O
# O
34;down O

their O
is O
no O
Netflix O
streaming O
still O
on O
the O
android O
app O
for O
this O
thing O
, O
just O
like O
the O
others O
. O

I O
can O
work O
off O
- O
line O
, O
I O
can O
do O
pretty O
much O
everything O
, O
I O
usually O
do O
. O

I O
had O
recently O
purchased O
a O
different O
case O
that O
was O
larger O
than O
I O
had O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
them O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
inexpensive O
yet O
good O
sounding O
computer O
speakers O
. O

The O
power O
plug O
on O
the O
left O
. O

but O
I O
would O
loose O
half O
my O
$ O
. O

They O
were O
not O
as O
comfortable O
as O
my O
Shure O
500s O
, O
but O
they O
were O
still O
clear O
to O
listen O
and O
maintained O
the O
seal O
without O
constant O
adjustment O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
memory O
to O
Mac O
users O
. O

Windows O
will O
NOT O
load O
if O
you O
connect O
your O
external O
DVD O
to O
the O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
port O
, O
as O
the O
PXE O
does O
not O
recognize O
the O
port O
and O
you O
will O
get O
errors O
about O
missing O
drivers O
and O
you O
will O
not O
see O
the O
SSD O
drive O
. O

we O
use O
it O
in O
our O
RV O
while O
traveling O
and O
it O
is O
a O
perfect O
addition O
. O

I O
just O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
not O
to O
have O
anything O
under O
it O
( O
like O
a O
sheet O
of O
paper O
or O
a O
credit O
card O
... O

It O
is O
lots O
of O
room O
and O
not O
too O
bulky O
but O

I O
can O
say O
that O
my O
new O
computer O
is O
way O
more O
responsive O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

With O
the O
hard O
drive O
installed O
, O
performance O
was O
certainly O
passable O
, O
but O
you O
could O
feel O
it O
chugging O
away O
. O

It O
would O
shut O
off O
after O
about O
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes O
of O
playing O
time O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Canon O
HV20 O
that O
takes O
very O
good O
video O
, O
but O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
HF O
S100 O
to O
me O
is O
the O
processing O
of O
the O
video O
to O
DVD O
and O
also O
not O
having O
to O
wind O
and O
rewind O
tapes O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
straight O
from O
Amazon O
with O
free O
shipping O
. O

I O
just O
got O
this O
today O
, O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

When O
it O
did O
finally O
connect O
it O
was O
laggy O
then O
eventually O
disconnect O
itself O
. O

The O
low O
price O
does O
n't O
mean O
lesser O
quality O
. O

For O
one O
, O
this O
is O
a O
tablet O
- O
style O
cord O
: O
it O
has O
a O
wall O
wart O
and O
a O
cable O
that O
connects O
to O
the O
system O
. O

Take O
a O
& O
# O
34;Back&#34 O
; O
pack O
and O
turn O
it O
to O
a O
photography O
gear O
wonder O
... O

The O
fact O
that O
I O
'm O
currently O
in O
possession O
of O
three O
nearly O
identical O
looking O
PNY O
USB O
drives O
of O
varying O
capacity O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
how O
closely O
this O
drive O
meets O
my O
specifications O
. O

definitely O
would O
recommend O
buying O
! O

I O
use O
it O
to O
connect O
my O
tablet O
HP O
500 O
Slate O
to O
my O
stereo O
system O
. O

You O
'll O
need O
to O
disable O
Fast O
Boot O
/ O
POST O
and O
Secure O
Boot O
and O
change O
the O
mode O
from O
UEFI O
to O
CSM O
. O

I O
have O
always O
had O
good O
luck O
with O
WD O
products O
. O

So O
I O
have O
no O
issues O
just O
yet O
and O
will O
see O
later O
on O
if O
I O
'll O
need O
to O
upgrade O
to O
4 O
gb O
since O
I O
have O
the O
standard O
lower O
end O
version O
of O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

As O
with O
any O
new O
computer O
, O
you O
may O
want O
to O
uninstall O
all O
the O
crap O
software O
that O
is O
pre O
- O
installed O
. O

This O
sleeve O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
a O
great O
fit O
for O
my O
Samsung O
Series O
9 O
13 O
. O

so O
I O
used O
one O
of O
the O
loops O
on O
that O
lens O
cap O
... O
perfect O
! O

Do O
n't O
miss O
out O
the O
chance O
! O
! O

The O
overall O
build O
of O
this O
netbook O
feels O
very O
solid O
and O
keyboard O
is O
firm O
, O
no O
flex O
. O

The O
delivery O
and O
installation O
was O
very O
professional O
. O

I O
've O
taken O
it O
through O
air O
ports O
, O
mountains O
, O
metro O
stations O
, O
buses O
, O
school O
campus O
.. O
it O
has O
taken O
all O
the O

You O
will O
have O
to O
go O
with O
the O

, O
supposedly O
. O

Overall O
I O
liked O
it O
though O
maybe O
I O
got O
a O
defective O

The O

itself O
is O
pretty O

The O

does O
not O
have O
enough O
power O
to O
blow O
out O

but O
that O
's O
okay O
with O
me O
( O
tinnitus O
runs O
in O
my O

) O

I O
'm O
sitting O
here O
listening O
to O

it O
sounds O
good O
to O
me O
for O
a O

I O
've O
already O
taken O
the O
bag O
with O
me O
on O
a O

and O
it O
fits O
in O
a O

no O

because O
1 O
) O
it O
was O
a O
backpack O
and O
comfy O
and O

) O

This O
is O
partially O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
my O
new O
router O
can O
output O
dual O
band O
N O
signals O
that O
this O
card O
can O
read O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
little O
height O
knobs O
on O
the O
back O
of O
it O
that O
stick O
into O
my O
legs O
when O
holding O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
... O
it O
should O
have O
something O
that O
folds O
away O
when O
used O
on O
a O
lap O
( O
hence O
the O
word O
LAPTOP).Overall O

It O
also O
has O
tons O
of O
pockets O
, O
zippered O
and O
open O
, O
which O
was O
another O
criteria O
. O

I O
took O
the O
655 O
t O
on O
my O
hunting O
trip O
to O
the O

this O
past O

. O

And O
while O
its O
not O
going O
to O
fill O
a O
concert O

, O
it O
sound O
is O
fairly O
good O
. O

Strong O
construction O
, O
as O
good O
as O
I O
've O
seen O
on O
a O

this O
size O

Then O
too O
, O
it O
might O
work O
for O
the O

you O
have O
, O
but O
what O
about O
the O
next O
one O

. O

I O
loaded O
all O
my O

It O
's O
annoying O
to O
be O
able O
to O
see O
an O

( O

that O
you O
ca O

Also O
my O

a O

this O

much O
smaller O
than O
the O

is O
barely O
noticeable O
despite O
the O
shiny O

completely O
shut O

V7 O
backpack O
is O
very O
roomy O
and O
has O
a O
nice O
number O
of O
pockets O
. O

Using O
the O
standard O
software O
out O
there O
did O
allow O
me O
to O
play O
the O
movie O
, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
a O
first O
class O
experience O
. O

For O
quite O
some O
time O
, O
I O
have O
been O
using O
an O
old O
Soundblaster O
Audigy O
2 O
value O
card O
in O
my O
PC O
. O

and O
I O
hate O
the O
way O
some O
of O
the O
TSA O
people O
handle O
your O
notebooks O
. O

As O
of O
right O
now O
it O
's O
a O
fingerprint O
magnet O
and O
looks O
like O
I O
rubbed O
a O
stick O
of O
butter O
all O
over O
it O
. O

The O
Case O
Logic O
DLBP-114 O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
hold O
my O
notebook O
, O
accessories O
, O
tablets O
, O
sunglasses O
, O
and O
the O
occasional O
technical O
book O
. O

Really O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
irks O
me O
is O
when O
I O
'm O
watching O
a O
video O
on O
youtube O
and O
the O
audio O
will O
stutter O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
the O
automatic O
configuration O
a O
try O
. O

It O
's O
big O
compared O
to O
the O
Nano O
itself O

so O
I O
'm O
not O
worried O
if O
one O
pops O
up O
during O
the O
warranty O
period O
( O
3 O
yrs).6 O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
two O
750 O

other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
fine O
piece O

Here O
's O
what O
a O
reviewer O
from O
The O
Register O
has O
to O
say O
on O
this O
exact O
subject O
, O
" O
As O
always O
, O
there O
are O
numerous O
build O
- O
to O
- O
order O
options O
, O
including O
an O
i7 O
processor O
running O
at O
1 O
. O

They O
should O
have O
kept O
Windows O
7 O
and O
just O
added O
the O
touch O
screen O
. O

When O
I O
need O
to O
take O
it O
off O
my O
shoulder O
there O
really O
is O
n't O
anything O
to O
firmly O
grab O
onto O
, O
so O

I O
will O
admit O
, O
the O
MBP O
was O
easy O
enough O
too O
. O

The O
light O
changed O
from O
red O
to O
green O
( O
signaling O
a O
change O
from O
720P O
to O
1080P O
) O
, O
but O
would O
not O
change O
back O
. O

Separate O

I O
have O
been O
a O
Logitech O

not O
anymore O
. O

You O
have O
made O
an O
utterly O
useless O
wireless O

. O

( O
Extra O
bonus O
: O
not O
having O
to O
listen O
to O
my O
husband O
pick O
on O
me O
for O
" O
if O
your O

was O

Having O
done O
so O
now O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
they O
are O
very O
good O
, O
and O
I O
use O
them O
on O
computer O
screens O
and O
glasses O
. O

It O
is O
a O
humorous O
detail O
they O
missed O
. O

I O
can O
live O
with O
low O
screen O
resolution O
... O

home O
does O
not O
support O
dual O
processors O
. O

If O
you O
're O
willing O
to O
treat O
this O
one O
with O
kid O
gloves O
and O
maybe O
not O
open O
or O
close O
it O
too O
much O
( O
the O
hinges O
ca O
n't O
take O
even O
a O
few O
months O
of O
normal O
wear O
and O
tear O
) O
, O
then O
it O
is O
a O
fairly O
nice O
machine O
. O

The O
wireless O
reception O
speed O
is O
also O
pretty O
terrible O
. O

Two O
USB O
ports O
allow O
for O
connecting O
your O
iPod O

external O
USB O
hard O

, O
USB O
Superdrive O
, O

, O
or O
whatever O
other O
USB O
device O
you O
might O
have O
. O

and O
I O
doubt O
anyone O
else O
would O
either O
. O

I O
use O
to O
connect O
my O
Galaxy O
phone O
to O
a O
USB O
connector O
or O
to O
plug O
in O
a O
USB O
storage O
device O
and O
will O
be O
getting O
one O
for O
a O
few O
other O
devices O
I O
have O
. O

The O
case O
is O
semi O
- O
rigid O
and O
seems O
well O
constructed O
. O

The O
number O
one O
advantage O
of O
this O
is O
lower O
TDP O
( O
low O
wattage O
) O
, O
which O
means O
longer O
battery O
life O
for O
the O
notebook O
. O

This O
one O
is O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate O
around O
because O
of O
the O
touchscreen O
. O

After O
realizing O
that O
it O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
work O
I O
tried O
to O
set O
it O
up O
with O
my O
Windows O
7 O
Laptop O
and O
was O
successful O
, O
however O
the O
wireless O
range O
on O
it O
is O
not O
nearly O
good O
enough O
to O
maintain O
a O
connection O
with O
my O
router O
at O
150 O
feet O
yet O

It O
works O
in O
the O
capacity O
of O
being O
highly O
portable O
, O
allowing O
me O
to O
move O
about O
the O
room O
as O
I O
give O
presentations O
, O
orientations O
and O
preside O
at O
meetings O
. O

My O

if O
you O
have O

you'll O
probably O
end O
up O

no O

I O
needed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
access O
the O
Internet O
via O
WiFi O
during O
meal O
breaks O
and O

stops O
and O
at O
night O
in O

the O

this O

well O

Amazon O
has O
notified O
me O
that O
they O
will O
not O
help O
me O
with O
my O
claim O
! O
! O
! O

Not O
too O
much O
to O
complaint O
about O
it O
, O
but O
not O
too O
much O
to O
be O
excited O
about O
it O

Double O

! O

Its O
a O
really O
stylish O
laptop O
, O
one O
thing O
HP O
always O
had O
on O
their O
side O
. O

The O
user O
is O
advised O
to O
install O
the O
software O
before O
plugging O
in O
the O
dock O
, O
which O
means O
one O
could O
not O
use O
the O
dock O
to O
get O
to O
the O
Internet O
in O
order O
to O
install O
the O
software O
. O

I O
'm O
personally O
not O
bothered O
by O
the O
small O
size O
of O
the O
drawing O
area O
, O
but O
if O
you O
think O
you O
might O
be O
then O
I O
'd O
go O
for O
a O
" O
medium O
sized O
" O
tablet O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

One O
thing O
that O
disappoints O
me O
, O
and O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
4 O
star O
rating O
, O
is O
that O
& O
# O
34;Pinch O
& O
Zoom&#34 O
; O
on O
the O

is O

. O

The O
performance O
is O
about O
an O
order O
of O
magnitude O
better O
than O
USB O
2 O
, O
and O
about O
three O
times O
better O
than O
Firewire O

- O
i. O

I O
researched O
a O
lot O
of O
cases O
. O

You O
can O
not O
access O
the O
battery O
without O
opening O
it O
up O
. O

The O
problem O
with O
this O
bag O
is O
that O
the O
footpad O
for O
the O
tripod O
holder O
is O
very O
small O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
really O
nice O
sleeve O
. O

At O
first O
, O
I O
figure O
this O
would O
be O
another O
memory O
to O
use O
for O
my O
camera O
; O
but O
I O
actually O
found O
this O
memory O
card O
works O
great O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
have O
the O
streaming O
only O
and O
just O
do O
not O
care O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
titles O
they O
carry O
. O

) O

This O
is O
my O
spare O
laptop O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
use O
it O
much O
. O

Could O
use O
maybe O
a O
little O
more O
padding O
but O
since O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
travelling O
with O
my O
laptop O
much O
it O
will O
serve O
the O
purpose O
I O
have O
intended O
for O
it O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
much O
exactly O
what O
I O
had O
expected O
when O
I O
ordered O
it O
. O

The O
connector O
was O
NOT O
a O
right O
angle O
connector O
as O
pictured O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
preferred O
. O

It O
is O
the O
antithesis O
of O
the O
trend O
to O
use O
our O
technology O
, O
more O
and O
more O
often O
, O
as O
a O
tool O
of O
enslavement O
and O
disrespect O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
as O
noticeable O
in O
low O
- O
light O
environments O
, O
but O
we O
also O
see O
poor O
side O
- O
to O
- O
side O
viewing O
, O
meaning O
you O
almost O
have O
to O
look O
at O
these O
dead O
- O
on O
straight O
to O
see O
a O
good O
image O
. O

They O
go O
on O
like O
the O
clear O
plastic O
screen O
protectors O
do O
. O

Paid O
apps O
are O
less O
then O
$ O
10 O
anyway O
. O

CAnd O
it O
's O
extremely O
quiet O
, O
with O
the O
lighting O
being O
very O
subtle O
. O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
size O
and O
weight O
for O
me O
. O

You O
simply O
connect O
the O
receiver O
to O
your O
HDTV O
or O
monitor O
with O
the O
included O
HDMI O
cable O
, O
tuck O
the O
ScreenBeam O
Pro O
behind O
your O
TV O
and O
follow O
the O
on O
- O
screen O
instructions O
for O
wirelessly O
connecting O
your O
laptop O
or O
tablet O
to O
the O
device O
. O

My O
buddy O
has O
the O
$ O
250 O
Jawbone O
and O
it O
sounds O
better O
, O
but O
not O
6 O
times O
better O
as O
the O
price O
should O
suggest O
. O

So O
, O
buy O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
... O
mine O
is O
going O
back O
, O
I O
've O
decided O
. O

If O
it O
worked O
I O
might O
have O
enjoyed O
it O
. O

That O
's O
the O
best O
way O
for O
me O
to O
describe O
the O
TV O
. O

I O
tried O
the O
Arcsoft O
Total O
MediaTheatre O
software O
to O
play O
a O
blu O
- O
ray O
disc O
, O
and O
it O
will O
only O
play O
the O
first O
title O
( O
anti O
- O
piracy O
warning O
) O
. O

The O
PS07 O
does O
n't O
has O
this O
issue O
at O
all O
, O
moreover O
you O
can O
release O
the O
bay O
covers O
just O
by O
pressing O
a O
button O
without O
screws O
. O

ordered O
it O
saturday O
, O
got O
it O
wednesday O
. O

I O
could O
live O
with O
its O
limitations O
but O
then O
it O
stopped O
working O
altogether O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
give O
away O
the O
Dell O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
that O
can O
not O
afford O
a O
computer O
of O
her O
own O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
would O
be O
even O
better O
( O
8 O
hours O
rather O
than O
6 O
hours O
) O
if O
the O
5600 O
amp O
battery O
was O
made O
available O
here O
in O
North O
America O
like O
it O
is O
in O
Europe O
. O

Anyway O
, O
before O
inserting O
the O
adapter O
, O
you O
have O
to O
first O
install O
its O
software O
and O
drivers O
. O

It O
runs O
in O
dual O
channel O
with O
the O
RAM O
I O
already O
had O
installed O
. O

It O
tracks O
very O
fast O
and O
takes O
just O
a O
little O
time O
to O
get O
adjusted O
to O
. O

Fedora O
recognized O
the O
card O
automagically O
and O
auto O
- O
mounts O
any O
USB O
flash O
drive O
I O
plug O
into O
it O
. O

I O
literally O
plugged O
them O
in O
and O
waited O
about O
30 O
seconds O
for O
Windows O
to O
load O
and O
install O
the O
driver O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
mind O
here O
, O
it O
's O
just O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

so O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
worth O
a O
try O
to O
get O
a O
new O
adapter O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
I O
have O
used O
several O
different O
kinds O
of O
lap O
desks O
. O

However O
, O
the O
design O
leaves O
it O
off O
- O
balance O

5 O
. O
5 O
hr O
battery O
life O
. O

and O
I O
go O
back O
and O
forth O
between O
a O
PC O
at O
work O
and O

the O
wires O
were O
frayed O
and O
coming O
apart O
. O

Replaced O
my O
original O
keyboard O
when O
it O
started O
sticking O
and O
missing O
. O

It O
fits O
my O
T60P O
exactly O
as O
the O
original O
battery O
did O
. O

Bought O
this O
a O
week O
ago O
( O
Oct O
27 O
) O
and O
also O
bought O
the O
new O
Lenovo O
13 O
. O

I O
have O
also O
had O
issues O
with O
the O
video O
drivers O
. O

I O
got O
this O
case O
for O
my O
iPad O
and O
it O
's O
a O
great O
fit O
even O
with O
my O
Switcheasy O
Nude O
case O
on O
! O

UPDATE O
JANUARY O
9TH O

6:20PM========================== O
... O

The O
sound O
from O
this O
item O
is O
distinct O
and O
has O
good O
volume O
and O
bass O
response O
. O

Sound O
Quality O
& O
Volume O
: O
I'm O
actually O
impressed O
with O
the O
overall O
sound O
quality O
of O
these O
speakers O
. O

Not O
enough O
of O
a O
reason O
not O
to O
buy O
this O
gem O
. O

If O
you O
have O
use O
for O
the O
higher O
gain O
antenna O
, O
the O
additional O
accessories O
are O
nice O
. O

My O
wrists O
are O
nowhere O
near O
the O
mouse O
when O
I O
type O
! O
) O
. O

If O
you O
already O
have O
your O
life O
confined O
within O
OS O
X O
, O
then O
upgrading O
to O
the O
Retina O
Pro O
will O
not O
hurt O
you O
at O
all O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
the O
best O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

But O
this O
is O
so O
light O
weight O
that O
after O
a O
week O
, O
I O
am O
still O
adjusting O
to O
using O
it O
. O

I O
brought O
the O
power O
supply O
with O
me O
and O
it O
made O
a O
noticeable O
difference O
in O
the O
brightness O
and O
contrast O
quality O
. O

Great O
for O
keeping O
in O
your O
laptop O
case O
; O
just O
as O
a O
repair O
tool O
for O
hard O
drives O
. O

Still O
the O
picture O
is O
wonderful O
( O
bright O
, O
clear O
, O
and O
detailed O
) O
. O

Photo O
trigger O
, O
2s O
delay O
and O
record O
/ O
stop O
buttons O
work O
consistently O
. O

First O
off O
the O
size O
is O
great O
. O

The O
cover O
is O
light O
and O
adds O
no O
noticeable O
weight O
and O
is O
thin O
so O
hardly O
increases O
the O
bulk O
at O
all O
, O
yet O
provides O
a O
good O
hard O
shell O
protection O
. O

after O
using O
it O
for O
one O
night O
they O
are O
EXTREMELY O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
problems O
with O
Sony O
not O
" O
recognizing O
" O
this O
battery O
replacement O
, O
as O
others O
have O
reported O
. O

XFX+R7870 O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
use O
this O
for O
my O
computer O
( O
If O
I O
want O
three O
monitors O
) O
. O

Soft O
to O
the O
touch O
and O
cleans O
very O
easy O
. O

, O
it O
's O
difficult O
, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
if O
you O
persevere O
you O
can O
come O
up O
a O
winner O
, O
even O
in O
a O
bad O
situation O
like O
that O
which O
I O
went O
through O
with O
this O
RAM O
. O

I O
did O
not O
do O
anything O
too O
memory O
intensive O
. O

No O
fuss O
or O
bother O
. O

This O
unit O
is O
an O
excellent O
value O

These O

never O
realistic O

must O
get O

by O

ORDERING O
THINGS O
FROM O
CHINA O
, O
" O
RED O
TAPE O
" O
THE O
CUSTOMS O
THING O

I O
first O
researched O
which O
stations O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
receive O
, O
then O
I O
researched O
how O
powerful O
the O
various O
antennas O
were O
. O

The O
battery O
locks O
securely O
into O
place O
and O
seems O
to O
hold O
the O
charge O
really O
well O
. O

A O
nice O
piece O
of O
engineering O
that O
is O
solid O
and O
compact O
. O

I O
'd O
order O
another O
one O
if O
I O
ever O
needed O
it O
. O

But O
then O
again O
, O
this O
is O
a O
hybrid O
hdd O
- O
ssd O
laptop O
. O

Combined O
with O
the O
native O
touch O
pad O
which O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
disable O
, O
when O
typing O
up O
a O
report O
, O
letter O
or O
even O
a O
Facebook O
post O
, O
I O
'll O
find O
that O
the O
cursor O
has O
suddenly O
jumped O
up O
a O
number O
of O
lines O
and O
I O
'm O
typing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
something O
previously O
written O
. O

If O
I O
connect O
it O
to O
my O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
port O
instead O
, O
but O
I O
got O
the O
same O
results O
again O
. O

It O
is O
somewhat O
similar O
in O
form O
to O
a O
Macbook O
Air O
, O
but O
it O
's O
also O
close O
to O
a O
number O
of O
the O
new O
Ultrabooks O
. O

I O
left O
the O
SimplyVibe O
SV O
- O
S350III O
unplugged O
from O
AC O
current O
however O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
just O
disabled O
it O
and O
started O
using O
the O
touchscreen O
for O
all O
my O
pointing O
needs O
. O

I O
hope O
someday O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get O
the O
very O
largest O
Intuos O
or O
Wacom O
's O
newest O
tablet O
model O
. O

Extremely O
pleased O
... O

I O
had O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
wireless O
card O
for O
my O
desktop O
that O
supported O
5GHz O
and O
after O
being O
completely O
let O
down O
by O
at O
least O
4 O
other O
products O
i O
came O
across O
this O
one O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

I O
recently O
bought O
3 O
of O
these O
. O

After O
taking O
all O
that O
junk O
off O
, O
it O
's O
now O
the O
rocket O
I O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
when O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

I O
had O
some O
concern O
buying O
site O
unseen O
because O
I O
know O
the O
previous O
envy O
models O
did O
n't O
quite O
deliver O
in O
this O
are O
- O

But O
very O
magnetic O
stickable O
to O
the O
case O
. O

As O
many O
of O
my O
fellow O
reviewers O
here O
, O
I O
am O
also O
a O
consultant O
with O
over O
10 O
years O
as O
a O
road O
warrior O
. O

Tracks O
well O
. O

So O
it O
fits O
kids O
heads O
pretty O
well O
and O
adults O
heads O
, O
is O
a O
little O
tight O
at O
first O
but O
flexes O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two O
without O
causing O
too O
much O
discomfort O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
put O
a O
sleeve O
of O
corregated O
cardboard O
in O
it O
when O
I O
find O
the O
need O
to O
transport O
a O
laptop O
with O
my O
camera O
. O

It O
's O
also O
about O
4 O
- O
5 O
pounds O
to O
carry O
. O

The O
build O
quality O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
compare O
when O
the O
laptops O
were O
running O
, O
but O
presumably O
the O
replacement O
would O
also O
be O
warmer O
in O
that O
situation O
. O

I O
had O
this O
exact O
cooling O
pad O
before O
I O
bought O
a O
new O
one O

Then O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
my O
Windows O
2000 O
work O
laptop O
up O
and O
runing O
with O
no O
hassles O
. O

It O
had O
plenty O
of O
room O
to O
spare O
. O

Apparently O
different O
colors O
in O
this O
series O
have O
different O
features O
. O

I O
think O
the O
problem O
is O
because O
of O
the O
rough O
finish O
on O
the O
stand O
, O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
apply O
die O
cut O
pads O
and O
expect O
them O
to O
stay O
in O
place O
. O

If O
you O
want O
the O
best O
battery O
lifeon O
an O
ultrabook O
then O
you O
should O
wait O
for O
Haswell O
to O
be O
released O
and O
possibly O
wait O
for O
the O
ThinkPad O
T440s O
to O
be O
released O
as O
well.+Storage O
: O
It O
comes O
with O
a O
fast O
Intel O
180 O

that O
has O
~120 O
GB O
of O
free O
space O
after O
doing O
all O
the O
configurations O
and O
installing O
all O
the O
windows O

Get O
one O
. O

I O
am O
talking O
about O
the O
regular O
things O
for O
my O
everyday O
life O
, O
so O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
will O
it O
perform O
on O
other O
specific O
programs O
. O

Only O
drawback O
: O
I O
can O
not O
get O
the O
camera O
's O
" O
special O
effects O
" O
to O
fully O
function O
with O
Skype O
. O

I O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
think O
the O
new O
Titan O
TTC O
- O
G3 O
T O
on O
the O
market O
nowadays O

In O
the O
" O
network O
" O
section O
, O
it O
specifies O
that O
this O
model O
comes O
with O
Intel O
4965 O
wifi O
chipset O
, O
which O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

This O
is O
even O
faster O
. O

I O
play O
a O
lot O
of O
games O
and O
it O
really O
cooled O
my O
laptop O
. O

but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
much O
different O
a O
macbook O
pro O
vs O
one O
with O
retina O
display O
, O
you O
may O
be O
confused O
. O

If O
this O
noise O
was O
gone O
, O
it O
would O
definitely O
be O
a O
5 O
star O
product O
. O

Which O
is O
fine O
because O
it O
's O
used O
mostly O
at O
home O
. O

this O
thing O
it O
awesome O
, O
well O
built O
and O
even O
came O
in O
a O
custom O
box O
( O
not O
some O
cheap O
package O
) O
, O
I O
even O
ordered O
a O
second O
one O

The O
drives O
synced O
very O
quickly O
and O
without O
any O
special O
prompting O
. O

Looks O
like O
Apple O
has O
got O
this O
model O
up O
to O
par O
. O

I O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
not O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

I O
did O
all O
that O
and O
used O
their O
new O
( O
beta O
) O

I O
listen O
to O
my O
iPod O
Nano O
in O
the O
car O
using O
this O
speaker O
and O
I O
am O
able O
to O
crank O
up O
the O
volume O
without O
distortion O
to O
the O
music O
or O
podcast O
that O
I O
am O
listen O
to O
. O

My O
two O
favorite O
bags O
do O
not O
hold O
this O
beast O
. O

I O
purchased O
2 O
of O
these O
, O
installed O
HDDs O
, O
and O
both O
work O
fine O
, O
Mac O
or O
PC O
. O

Still O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
good O
price O
! O

This O
has O
happened O
twice O
to O
me O
, O
and O
on O
both O
occasions O
using O
an O
air O
blower O
along O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
button O
fixed O
it.- O

It O
's O
smaller O
than O
the O
Bluetooth O

I O
have O
not O
yet O
installed O
it O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
have O
found O
the O
easy O
to O
follow O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
do O
this O
on O
line O
when O
the O
time O
comes O
. O

Then O
after O
about O
a O
month O
, O
part O
of O
the O
board O
went O
- O
not O
only O
the O
wireless O
card O
but O
also O
the O
LAN O
card O
. O

it O
has O
a O
few O
burrs O
that O
were O
not O
sanded O
away O
in O
the O
plastic O
and O
it O
feels O
a O
little O
cheap O
. O

Battery O
life O
several O
times O
longer O
compared O
to O
larger O
laptops O
. O

While O
pressing O
that O
button O
, O
the O
pen O
movement O
is O
reduced O
on O
the O
screen O
, O
to O
buy O
more O
fine O
control O
. O

Go O
with O
Plantronics O
or O
logitech O
. O

I O
received O
this O
battery O
about O
a O
week O
ago O
. O

perfectly O
once O
you O
know O
how O
to O
correct O
the O
flaw O
with O
the O
case O
separating O
at O
the O
receptacle O
end O
. O

the O
cons O
are O
: O
intergrated O
graphics O
with O
shared O
memory O
, O
three O
usb O
ports O
, O
no O
internal O
modem O
, O
and O
no O

rom O

. O

My O
cats O
like O
to O
chew O
on O
the O
stepped O
down O
power O
cord O
portion O
of O
my O
adapters O
. O

So O
I O
sent O
it O
back O
again O
, O
and O
again O
I O
got O
it O
back O
with O
the O
intermittent O
battery O
problem O
solved O
, O
but O
now O
the O
audio O
is O
intermittent O
and O
I O
must O
send O
it O
back O
again O
. O

Good O
deal O
for O
the O
money O
! O

But O
when O
i O
updated O
to O
ICS O
... O
whoa O
! O

ca O
n't O
think O
of O
any O
for O
my O

Plug O
them O
into O
a O

system O
( O

at O
home O
, O

I O
misread O
the O
description O
and O
had O
to O
return O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
now O
I O
can O
use O
another O
old O
driveI O
had O
to O
backup O

Usually O
you O
find O
4 O
port O

around O
the O

. O

Why O
Apple O
dropped O
this O
off O
the O
MacBook O
Air O

and O
I O
can O
regulate O
the O
size O
. O

Really O
nice O
if O
you O
find O
yourself O
on O
your O

a O
lot O
with O

long O
after O
I O
wrote O

Within O

over O
without O
ever O
firing O
a O
shot O
. O

but O
for O
what O
the O
speaker O
is O
intended O
for O
it O
is O
perfect O
! O

and O
I O
watch O
youtube O
videos O
as O
fast O
as O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
have O
purchased O
a O
few O
of O
these O
for O
my O
clients O
and O
recently O
myself O
and O
the O
video O
/ O
audio O
quality O
is O
bar O
none O
the O
best O
of O
any O
webcam O
i O
have O
used O
. O

I O
watch O
Hulu O
/ O
Netflix O
in O
the O
kitchen O
on O
my O
laptop O
, O
and O
this O
device O
is O
a O
LIFESAVER O
. O

The O
side O
pocket O
is O
also O
rather O
flat O
and O
is O
not O
the O
right O
size O
and O
shape O
to O
hold O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
or O
any O
other O
accessory O
. O

This O
backpack O
has O
, O
back O
to O
front O
: O

Update O
: O
Just O
bought O
another O
. O

If O
you O
work O
in O
an O
area O
with O
fluorescent O
lighting O
overhead O
, O
or O
if O
you O
take O
it O
near O
a O
window O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
work O
at O
it O
to O
find O
a O
position O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
much O
glare O
. O

Many O
different O
websites O
state O
that O
the O
vertical O
bag O
look O
is O
not O
popular O
because O
they O
tend O
to O
have O
a O
purse O
look O
to O
them O
. O

I O
got O
this O
because O
I O
travel O
so O
much O
, O
and O
it O
's O
easier O
to O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
bag O
. O

160 O
GB O
HD O
. O

Bought O
this O
as O
a O
birthday O
present O
for O
my O
daughters O
( O
since O
they O
are O
using O
them O
in O
school O
) O
and O
they O
love O
them O
. O

Would O
like O
to O
see O
spare O
batteries O
available O
and O
a O
more O
compact O
charger O
. O

Returning O
and O
shame O
as O
it O
is O
a O
great O
idea O
! O

I O
see O
myself O
with O
this O
laptop O
for O
another O
2 O
- O
3 O
years O
. O

and O
I O
get O
compliments O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
only O
use O
it O
because O
it O
's O
the O
only O
bag O
that O
I O
could O
find O
that O
would O
hold O
my O
big O
18 O
" O
notebook O
computer O
. O

I O
was O
actually O
hoping O
for O
a O
little O
more O
out O
of O
this O
, O
the O
screen O
looks O
ok O
and O
this O
has O
a O
hard O
time O
reading O
dvds O
. O

, O
I O
did O
order O
this O
specifically O
to O
toss O
a O
Linux O
based O
firmware O
on O
it O
. O

Lest O
you O
think O
that O
I O
am O
totally O
against O
WIn O
8 O
. O

The O
price O
is O
very O
reasonable O
. O

only O
3 O
ft O
. O
long O
. O

It O
worked O
great O
for O
two O
weeks O
but O
now O
only O
says O
I O
/ O
O O
error O
and O
does O
nothing O
else O

Counting O
my O
own O
individual O
eyelashes O
, O
while O
plucking O
them O
out O
, O
would O
be O
100 O
% O
guaranteed O
more O
enjoyable O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
subwoofer O
that O
's O
built O
into O
the O
TV O
, O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
quite O
good O
. O

It O
last O
long O
and O
its O
perfect O
to O
use O
to O
laptop O
and O
desktop O
solutions O
. O

When O
it O
was O
working O
, O
the O
drive O
was O
very O
fast O
and O
quiet O
, O
though O
, O
so O
I O
can O
certainly O
understand O
the O
high O
marks O
people O
give O
these O
drives O
when O
they O
work O
. O

As O
I O
said O
in O
my O
first O
Skinomi O
review O
, O
do O
n't O
buy O
ZAGG O
, O
and O
forget O
about O
those O
cheap O
ones O
- O
they O
're O
cheap O
. O

Setup O
is O
to O
just O
plug O
it O
into O
a O
port O
. O

I O
watch O
a O
lot O
of O
movies O
and O
TV O
shows O
on O
my O
laptops O
and O
they O
are O
perfect O
for O
that O
. O

it O
's O
really O
, O
really O
cute O
looking- O
plug O
and O
play O
, O
literally O
- O
requires O
no O
setup O
or O
configuration O
to O
play O
, O
you O
simply O
plug O
the O
the O
3 O
. O
5 O
mm O
jack O
into O
your O
device O
's O
audio O
output- O
charges O
off O
your O
computer O
or O
any O
standard O
USB O
charger- O
lasts O
for O
many O
hours O
( O
they O
say O
up O
to O
8) O
on O
one O
charge- O
USB O
charging O
cable O
is O
included- O
comes O
with O
a O
nice O
bag O
where O
it O
can O
be O
stored O
and O
protected O
from O
scratches O
while O
not O
in O
useIn O
fewer O
words O
, O
it O
's O
the O
best O
' O
inexpensive O
' O
external O
speaker O

Would O
buy O
again O
. O

Skype O
works O
great O
with O
the O
XPS12 O
. O

It O
has O
a O
full O
number O
pad O
on O
the O
right O
side O
, O
slightly O
separated O
from O
the O
main O
keys O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
joined O
to O
the O
VGA O
cable O
a O
few O
inches O
down O
from O
each O
connector O
. O

Anybody O
who O
has O
laptops O
knows O
the O
power O
cord O
and O
or O
the O
battery O
has O
2 O
year O
or O
so O
life O
. O

This O
is O
not O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
a O
LOT O
with O
it O
... O
we O
play O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
games O
that O
play O
in O
high O
resolution O
and O
we O
tend O
to O
buy O
higher O
end O
computers O
as O
a O
result O
. O

I O
can O
control O
the O
volume O
in O
the O
headphones O
without O
a O
single O
sound O
coming O
from O
the O
tv O
itself O
. O

Did O
a O
ton O
of O
research O
. O

If O
I O
let O
it O
sit O
there O
doing O
nothing O
( O
but O
powered O
on O
) O
, O
it O
'll O
usually O
be O
fine O
on O
its O
own O
. O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
consider O
that O
worth O
the O
effort O
. O

Or O
you O
can O
view O
it O
on O
their O
website O
. O

This O
little O
netbook O
is O
amazing O
, O
booted O
right O
up O
, O
added O
memory O
in O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
very O
portable O
, O
battery O
life O
very O
good O
, O
keyboard O
not O
bad O
. O

If O
you O
were O
to O
plop O
this O
backpack O
with O
your O
note O
book O
down O
, O
I O
could O
see O
that O
damage O
could O
result O
. O

In O
addiition O
, O
the O
included O
headphone O
splitter O
arrived O
in O
very O
poor O
condition O
. O

The O
compact O
size O
keeps O
me O
from O
packing O
too O
much O
junk O
when O
I O
travel O
, O
but O
there O
's O
room O
in O
there O
for O
everything O
I O
need O
. O

The O
straps O
on O
each O
side O
, O
clip O
together O
to O
keep O
the O
backpack O
cinched O
up O
and O
close O
to O
your O
body O
for O
better O
weight O
distribution O
. O

Limited O
Linux O
. O

Pros;-battery O
charges O
quickly O
- O
runs O
incredibly O
quiet O
and O
fairly O
cool O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

the O
part O
number O
on O
it O
as O
UM08A31 O
, O
but O
the O
battery O
is O
anything O
but O
that O
. O

Colors O
are O
natural O
and O
the O
" O
Splendid O
" O
application O
allows O
one O
to O
customize O
viewing O
almost O
limitlessly O
. O

Got O
al O
the O
information O
on O
it O
, O
but O
have O
n't O
attempted O
the O
actual O
flash O
yet O
and O
am O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Everything O
just O
worked O
. O

The O
same O
was O
true O
for O
the O
next O
2 O
times O
that O
the O
bag O
was O
loaded O
in O
with O
the O
checked O
baggage O
as O
we O
continued O
our O
trip O
. O

So O
2 O
1/2 O
years O
later O
I O
took O
the O
chance O
and O
called O
Samsung O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

In O
my O
tests O
, O
I O
got O
to O
20 O
feet O
before O
it O
cut O
out O
. O

the O
included O
AC O
adapter O
or O
by O
6 O
AA O
sized O
batteries O
located O
behind O
a O
back O
panel O
that O
has O
a O
nice O
and O
secure O
turn O
- O
lock O
closure O
. O

anyways O
, O
this O
backpack O
is O
LOADED O
, O
stitched O
well O
, O
and O
full O
of O
features O
! O

And O
unlike O
the O
original O
has O
a O
1 O
year O
warranty O

1A O
Charging O
Port O
with O

Lower O
the O
volume O
on O
the O
music O
device O
, O
and O
crank O
this O
little O
thing O
up O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
cooler O
is O
unmatched O
in O
it O
's O
ability O
, O
given O
its O
still O
portable O
nature O
. O

I O
've O
played O
some O
games O
and O
they O
run O
smoothly O
, O
all O
fine O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
underside O
is O
a O
little O
hard O
and O
I O
would O
've O
preferred O
something O
softer O
like O
memory O
foam O
or O
squishy O
beads O
. O

But O
the O
screen O
quality O
just O
sucks O
. O

I O
am O
pleased O
with O
this O
bag O
. O

they O
will O
let O
me O
return O
this O
product O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
battery O
and O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
company O
, O
Anker O
. O

Here O
's O
what O
finally O
worked O
thanks O
to O
the O
help O
from O
DavesDrivers:1 O
. O

So O
its O
loud O
and O
if O
you O
make O
the O
mistake O
of O
placing O
your O
laptop O
on O
your O
lap O
, O
be O
warned O
you O
will O
receive O
a O
burn O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
they O
made O
a O
external O
hard O
drive O
adapter O
until O
the O
other O
day O
and O
when O
I O
saw O
this O
I O
had O
to O
get O
it O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
use O
it O
daily O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
, O
as O
it O
does O
the O
job O
it O
advertises O
, O
and O
that O
's O
what O
matters O
. O

All O
it O
needed O
was O
just O
an O
additional O
1/4 O
" O
width O
on O
the O
spine O
, O
and O
this O
would O
" O
absolutely O
" O
the O
best O
case O
in O
the O
market O
for O
anyone O
! O

Since O
I O
scrubbed O
the O
HD O
and O
made O
Kubuntu O
9 O

I O
do O
nt O
have O
time O
to O
return O
it O

While O
it O
is O
on O
the O
large O
and O
heavy O
side O
for O
when O
you O
want O
to O
travel O
light O
, O
I O
really O
do O
not O
see O
any O
major O
downsides O
and O
highly O
recommend O
this O
for O
medium O
to O
large O
loads O
. O

If O
you O
can O
get O
the O
drivers O
to O
work O
fine O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
product O
. O

There O
is O
, O
however O
, O
one O
fatal O
flaw O
with O
the O
quality O
control O
-- O
there O
is O
none O
. O

I O
thought O
what O
a O
great O
way O
to O
give O
my O
Mac O
Book O
some O
color O
. O

PROS:-Using O
the O
XPAD O
has O
significantly O
reduced O
both O
overheating O
and O
crashing O
. O

Overall O
, O
do O
not O
buy O
this O
product O
unless O
you O
know O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

Getting O
this O
one O
to O
work O
is O
simple O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
. O

Port O
( O
much O
faster O
for O
devices O
that O
support O
it)- O
USB O

I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
much O
better O
in O
terms O
of O
connection O
speed O
. O

This O
charger O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O
based O
on O
it O
's O
product O
description O
but O
in O
the O
end O
based O
on O
my O
test O
results O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
worth O
cost O
nor O
can O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

At O
Tampalaptop O
I O
need O
my O
money O
back O
! O

( O
yes O
the O
apple O
logo O
does O
shine O
though O
) O

The O
battery O
is O
working O
properly O
. O

The O
three O
built O
- O
in O
connector O
cables O
are O
all O
quite O
short O
and O
are O
only O
suitable O
for O
charging O
the O
device O
while O
it O
's O
inside O
the O
bag O
. O

For O
the O
price O
it O
was O
def O
worth O
it O
. O

so O
I O
can O
access O
my O
movies O
and O
files O
from O
my O
flash O
drives O
! O
! O

Also O
, O
the O
tablet O
comes O
with O
a O
nice O
, O
weighted O
pen O
holder O
, O
that O
sits O
on O
your O
desk O
, O
or O
work O
area O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
; O
this O
is O
EASILY O
the O
nicest O
looking O
PC O
I O
, O
or O
my O
wife O
, O
have O
ever O
seen O
! O

These O
are O
very O
powerful O
, O
there O
is O
always O
more O
than O
enough O
volume O
with O
them O
. O

Although O
a O
little O
dirty O
, O
the O
bag O
looks O
new O
still O
. O

" O
He O
told O
me O
that O
is O
all O
that O
can O
be O
done O
to O
which O
I O
said O
I O
just O
want O
to O
return O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
've O
found O
that O
raising O
the O
pad O
with O
something O
can O
help O
a O
bit O
. O

The O
function O
keys O
work O
just O
fine O
on O
the O
iPad O
Air O
. O

People O
have O
mentioned O
this O
machine O
gets O
hot O
but O
for O
me O
its O
not O
so O
hot O
that O
i O
ca O
n't O
keep O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
or O
that O
i O
need O
to O
get O
a O
cooler O
. O

My O
dongle O
did O
not O
come O
with O
a O
CD O
, O
but O
the O
MS O
Vista O
control O
panel O
is O
working O
great O
so O
far O
. O

This O
small O
wonder O
is O
clear O
and O
load O
even O
at O
its O
limits O
it O
still O
rocks O
with O
minimal O
distortion O
. O

It O
sounds O
best O
after O
you O
open O
it O
up O
. O

There O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
metal O
logo O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
sleeve O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
download O
speeds O
of O
10 O
to O
15 O
Mbps O
; O
on O
this O
android O
unit O
I O
'm O
lucky O
to O
crack O
1 O
Mbps O
and O
mostly O
not O
even O
near O
that O
, O
and O
even O
when O
I O
do O
get O
signal O

My O
search O
led O
me O
to O
this O
piece O
. O

I O
received O
this O
item O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O

I O
wanted O
to O
setup O
a O
media O
center O
( O
PC O
) O
to O
store O
all O
my O
videos O
, O
pictures O
and O
mp3 O
files O
and O
be O
able O
to O
view O
them O
from O
my O
tv O
in O
my O
bedroom O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
familiar O
with O
game O
consoles O

It O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
want O
, O
unlike O
other O
retractable O
micro O
USB O
cables O
which O
only O
allow O
you O
to O
charge O
your O
Kindle O
Fire O
, O
not O
transfer O
data O
to O
and O
from O
it O
. O

Once O
these O
are O
all O
plugged O
in O
and O
you O
agree O
to O
the O
license O
the O
laptop O
is O
ready O
for O
use O
. O

Anyway O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pain O
always O
plugging O
in O
my O
phone O
every O
time O
I O
got O
in O
the O
truck O
... O

Luckily O
my O
trusty O
Moto O
EQ5 O
cable O
fits O
the O
power O
jack O
and O
is O
pretty O
long O
. O

This O
webcam O
works O
flawlessly O
with O
Google O
Talk O
( O
the O
web O
page O
version O
) O
, O
Windows O
Messenger O
and O
Skype O
. O

Great O
for O
smaller O
items O
. O

Hopefully O
it O
does O
n't O
screw O
with O
other O
more O
important O
components O
. O

i O
bought O
two O
they O
will O
charge O
but O
will O
not O
go O
all O
the O

without O

then O
plug O

You O
'd O
think O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
AirPort O
to O
recognize O
the O
network O
and O
play O
some O
music O
on O
our O
stereo O
would O
be O
easy O
. O

Can O
also O
double O

use O

you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
the O

AVOID O
at O
all O
cost!)______________________________________________________________________________== O

So O
overall O
a O
great O
replacement O
battery O
. O

I O
plugged O
in O
my O
iPad O
, O
and O
it O
charges O
fine O
but O
will O
not O
sync O
. O

The O
sound O
on O
this O
Samsung O
is O
tinny O
and O
more O
typical O
of O
what O
you O
generally O
hear O
in O
flat O
panels O
... O

I O
am O
a O
lay O
man O
having O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
laptop O
with O
keboard O
being O
lit O
from O
undernith O
. O

loud O
and O
proud O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
one O
and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

Because O
this O
is O
a O
free O
software O
, O
as O
a O
user O
you O
must O
manually O
start O
the O
scaning O
process O
or O
by O
buying O
retail O
version O
you O
'll O
unlock O
the O
auto O
scan O
scheduler O
feature O
. O

sooooo O
many O
bubbles O
..... O
and O
it O
has O
a O
glare O
... O

First O
time O
powering O
it O
on O
took O
about O
20 O
minutes O
to O
configure O
the O
options O
( O
language O
, O
time O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
self O
- O
configure O
Windows O
7 O

I O
will O
update O
if O
this O
thing O
goes O
down O
but O
they O
do O
claim O
to O
have O
a O
great O
warranty O
program O
. O

I O
like O
it O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
Logitech O
, O
and O
this O
is O
much O
less O
expensive O
. O

Have O
it O
wirelessly O
paired O
to O
my O
HP O
all O
- O
in O
- O
one O
printer O
. O

1 O
inch O
transformer O
book O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
some O
noteworthy O
features O
, O
the O
inexplicably O
poor O
battery O
life O
on O
the O
new O
Acer O
Aspire O
V5 O
- O

Allows O
me O
to O
charge O

Galaxy O
Note O

. O

( O
Although O
with O
classical O
pieces O
the O
bass O
sounds O
nice O
. O
) O

The O
mitigating O
factor O
in O
my O
gripes O
is O
that O
the O
Mogo O
mouse O
is O
not O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
replacement O
for O
a O
home O
mouse O
, O
and O
this O
is O
true O
. O

) O

It O
will O
fry O
your O
computer O
. O

Also O
BE O
CAREFUL O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
battery O
life O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
images O
are O
sharp O
and O
the O
colors O
are O
faithful O
. O

made O
well O
i O
recommend O
it O
has O
alot O
of O
compartments O
for O

from O
the O

I O
really O
do O
love O
the O
backlit O
keys O
, O
as O
I O
have O
a O
backlit O
keyboard O
on O
my O
desktop O
computer O
and O
can O
not O
imagine O
going O
back O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
device O
. O

The O
other O
side O
of O
the O
bag O
has O
a O
strap O
with O
3 O
loops O
great O
for O
other O
accessories O
to O
attach O
to O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
it O
is O
not O
mentioned O
in O
the O
advertisement O
that O
the O
128 O
MB O
version O
is O
compatible O
, O
but O
it O
is.]One O
nice O
thing O
about O
this O
card O
is O
that O
there O
is O
24/7 O
tech O
support O
available O
if O
something O
should O
go O
wrong O
with O
it O
( O
or O
with O
installation O
or O
whatever O
) O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
could O
really O
go O
wrong O
with O
it O
--I O
guess O
that O
's O
why O
they O
offer O
the O
tech O
support O
! O

( O
some O
more O
words O
to O
get O
to O
required O
limit O
) O

The O
bass O
control O
knob O
is O
easy O
to O
adjust O
and O
is O
more O
that O
sufficient O
for O
listening O
to O
an O
iPod O
or O
other O
music O
player O
at O
moderate O
volume O
. O

Once O
connected O
, O
no O
need O
to O
touch O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
wireless O
adapter O
that O
would O
n't O
cause O
me O
to O
lose O
too O
much O
speed O
compared O
to O
Ethernet O

Liked O
it O
so O
so O
much O
got O
one O
for O
each O
of O
my O
grown O
kids O
and O
their O
families O
. O

Looks O
aside O
, O
this O
Chromebook O
is O
perfectly O
functional O
and O
definitely O
an O
upgrade O
if O
you O
're O
coming O
from O
the O
previous O
generation O
. O

It O
works O
exactly O
as O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
. O

I O
bought O
these O
being O
hopeful O
that O
they O
would O
show O
some O
true O
worth O
in O
what O
they O
cost O
but O
honestly O
just O
save O
for O
a O
high O
end O
headset O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
so O
far O
, O
and O
would O
definately O
recommend O
it O
. O

The O

I O
also O
think O
the O

will O
fill O
out O
a O
bit O
with O
time O

Good O

Fair O

but O
only O
four O

because O
it O
had O
a O
bad O

in O
the O
pictures O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
like O
a O
minty O
green O
, O
however O
, O
the O
color O
has O
a O
tad O
bit O
more O
bluish O
hue O
to O
it O
. O

It O
hugs O
your O
body O
, O
and O
you O
can O
easily O
mount O
and O
dismount O
it O
from O
your O
shoulder O
. O

Get O
your O
regular O
corded O

tape O
it O
to O
your O

and O
try O

on O

The O

is O
super O
fast O

pretty O
small O

After O
all O
that O
, O
there O
is O
still O

for O

5 O

2 O

so O
this O

I O

I O

I O

glad O
I O
kept O

I O
'll O

a O

it O
does O

At O
this O

, O
it O
is O
a O
no O

Works O
flawlessly O
so O
far O
. O

BUT O
I O
BOUGHT O

I O

60 O

and O
I O
was O
only O
able O
to O
pick O
up O
1 O
channel O
with O
the O
supplied O
antenna O
, O
so O
I O
connected O
my O
cable O
and O
It O
works O
as O
it O
should O
, O
picture O
looks O
good O

I O
really O
like O
the O
backupack O
design O
that O
allows O
both O

. O

Belkin O
is O
a O
reliable O
company O
and O
the O
other O
Belkin O
usb O

I O
have O
( O
different O
model O
) O
is O
equally O
reliable O
. O

I O
'm O
extremely O
computer O
experienced O
and O
believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
this O
is O
simply O
beyond O
any O
fix O
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
prefer O
a O
little O
more O
rigor O
in O
my O
laptop O
sleeves O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
soft O
, O
quarter O

~8 O

you O
can O
get O
1st O

for O
that O
price O

Fingers O
crossed O
. O

It O
felt O
" O
heavy O
in O
my O
hands O
" O
until O
I O
lifted O
the O
old O
Dell O
M1330 O
. O

I O
have O
been O
monitoring O
the O
temps O
on O
my O
CPU O
and O
GPU O

The O
performance O
is O
good O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
functional O
charger O
that O
includes O
a O
USB O
charging O
port O
. O

The O
other O
bonus O
for O
me O
for O
this O
is O
obviously O
the O
display O
, O
the O
touch O
screen O
, O
the O
stability O
, O
and O
the O
integration O
with O
Android O
/ O
Chrome O
devices O
. O

and O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
the O
26th O
of O
August O
when O
I O
strap O
it O
on O
and O
go O
to O
school O
on O
my O
motorcycle O
. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
latex O
like O
rubber O
material O
that O
it O
is O
constructed O
of O
. O

That O
's O
pure O
BS O
for O
a O
$ O
1200 O
device O
and O
people O
should O
just O
stop O
buying O
it O
. O

If O
you O
really O
want O
to O
use O
your O
TV O
for O
reading O
such O
find O
details O
, O
then O
it O
's O
more O
likely O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
buy O
a O
TV O
that O
can O
take O
regular O
VGA O
signals O
without O
conversion O
. O

This O
little O
machine O
is O
fast O
and O
with O
the O
ability O
to O
use O
it O
as O
a O
touchscreen O
we O
are O
using O
it O
for O
everything O

it O

this O

did O
not O
cost O

for O

to O
do O
what O
I O

It O

it O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
I O
would O
like O
it O
to O
be O
blue O

I O
was O
aware O
that O
it O
was O

It O
allows O

This O

In O

the O

but O
as O
the O

was O
moved O
farther O
away O
( O
~25 O
+ O
feet O
) O
, O
the O

also O
put O
the O

in O
the O

with O

Then O
Belkin O
entered O
this O
market O

and O
made O
my O
choice O
an O
easy O
one O
. O

I O
recommend O
to O
everyone O
. O

The O
receiver O
is O
in O
a O
usb O
port O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
my O
laptop O
, O
just O
next O
to O
my O
mousepad O
but O
the O
nano O
size O
keeps O
it O
from O
being O
a O
problem O

But O
this O
is O
way O
too O
small O
for O
a O
laptop O
any O
bigger O
. O

I O
was O
replacing O
a O

with O
a O
cheap O

at O
the O

( O
which O
did O
not O
work O
reliably O
) O
. O

On O
the O
whole O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
you O
should O
keep O
in O
your O
backpack O
, O
messenger O
bag O
or O
wherever O
you O
keep O
your O
mobile O
gadget O
. O

Was O
easy O
to O
pair O
it O
up O
with O
iPhone O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
Amazon O
refunded O
my O
cost O

including O
shipping O

A O
month O
later O
, O
my O
case O
& O
mobo O
were O
installed O
and O
I O
was O
making O
connections O
when O
I O
had O
noticed O
I O
overlooked O
a O
slight O
mishap O
in O
that O
my O
mobo O
does O
not O
have O
any O
USB O
3 O

and O
I O
use O
my O
laptop O
every O
day O

I O
put O
back O
the O
cheaper O
Wifi O
adapter O

I O
can O
confidently O
say O
that O
it O
has O
taken O
several O
of O
the O
same O
drops O
and O
many O
others O
that O
were O
worse O
and O
it O
still O
is O
in O
great O
shape O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
the O
cable O
for O
several O
weeks O
and O
that O
snug O
" O
lock O
" O
has O
n't O
worn O
in O
or O
lost O
any O
of O
its O
connectivity O
. O

After O
researching O
online O
why O
would O
not O
charge O
battery O
, O
found O
reviews O
that O
dell O
has O
made O
some O
of O
there O
systems O
to O
not O
work O
and O
charge O
unless O
there O
brand O
only O

The O
rotating O

on O
the O

works O
extremely O
well O
, O
and O
feels O
like O
it O
will O
hold O
up O
well O
over O
time O
. O

But O
still O
somewhat O
lower O
quality O
than O
its O
other O
( O
cheaper O
) O
backpack O
. O

It O
is O
light O
weight O
for O
the O
size O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
6 O
' O
charging O
cable O
for O
her O
android O
phone O
. O

They O
are O
not O
flimsy O
cables O
. O

GREAT O
extra O
long O
Cable O
for O
ASUS O
TRANSFORMER O
. O

Work O
well O
with O
Windows O
Bluetooth O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
much O
. O

The O
Screen O
was O
really O
easy O
to O
replace O
. O

Amazing O
thin O
machine O
. O

( O
As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
, O
the O
Sims O
3 O
can O
make O
almost O
any O
normal O
laptop O
crash O
, O
so O
this O
is O
actually O
fairly O
impressive.)It O
plays O
videogames O
well O
on O
medium O
- O
high O
graphics O
. O

The O
whole O
thing O
feels O
great O
to O
use O
and O
carry O
. O

I O
did O
some O
extensive O
research O
and O
tried O
about O
5 O
different O
suggested O
drivers O
before O
I O
finally O
stumbled O
upon O
a O
web O
site O
that O
explained O
that O
there O
was O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
cards O
/ O
drivers O
depending O
on O
when O
they O
were O
manufactured O
- O
with O
the O
rev O
. O

If O
I O
plug O
my O
speaker O
into O
the O
same O
power O
source O
as O
this O
bluetooth O
receiver O
I O
do O
get O
a O
minor O
noise O
loop O
. O

which O
is O
about O
normal O
for O
that O
drive O
. O

Free O
4 O
g O
would O
come O
in O
handy O
also O
. O

only O
find O
out O
you O
need O
to O
security O
check O
to O
get O
in O
. O

I O
had O
no O
problem O
connecting O
a O
mouse O
or O
keyboard O
to O
my O
GS3 O
. O

And O
I O
expected O
more O
volume O
boost O
as O
well O
. O

I O
'm O
toying O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
just O
wiping O
and O
reinstalling O
a O
clean O
version O
of O
Windows O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
simple O
way O
to O
eliminate O
dropped O
calls O
while O
you O
travel O
and O
to O
maintain O
a O
strong O
signal O
in O
the O
home O
, O
this O
will O
definitely O
do O
the O
trick O
. O

slow O
to O
write O
, O
but O
then O
I O
knew O
that O
going O
in O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
bought O
a O
different O
hard O
shell O
case O
, O
but O
I O
am O
using O
this O
one O
ok O
after O
my O
modification O
. O

We O
bought O
several O
of O
these O
for O
the O
office O
and O
they O
work O
as O
intended O
. O

but O
I O
just O
could O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
never O
went O
back O
to O
try O
to O
new O
batteries O
in O
the O
unit O
or O
remote O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
wide O
screen O
22 O
" O
monitor O
, O
consider O
this O
baby O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
trying O
to O
think O
of O
something O
negative O
to O
report O
, O
but O
I O
just O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anything O
. O

The O
pockets O
are O
just O
" O
O O
- O
K O
" O
since O
they O
are O
fairly O
simple O
and O
none O
of O
them O
are O
padded O
. O

Works O
as O
advertised O

It O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
fairly O
cool O
, O
at O
least O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
as O
warm O
as O
it O
did O
before O
. O

OK O
, O
I O
admit O
- O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
16 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
a O
VERY O
stupid O
idea O
on O
Apple O
's O
part O
. O

Much O
nicer O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
micro O
usb O
cables O
I O
have O
. O

Should O
have O
bought O
the O
Mac O
though O
it O
costs O
more O
. O

This O
will O
definitely O
hold O
most O
laptops O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
primary O
reasons O
I O
picked O
this O
computer O
( O
my O
non O
- O
negotiables O
) O
, O
and O
how O
they O
're O
performing O
for O
me:17 O
. O

The O
sleeve O
is O
slightly O
stretchy O
, O
so O
you O
could O
probably O
fit O
something O
else O
in O
there O
with O
the O
Netbook O
if O
you O
tried O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
, O
as O
it O
could O
scratch O
the O
Netbook O
and O
defeat O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
sleeve O
. O

Right O
idea O
, O
wrong O
mouse O
/ O
company O
. O

It O
's O
connected O
to O
my O
new O
HP O
PC O
, O
and O
they O
are O
waltzing O
perfectly O
. O

What O
this O
little O
system O
does O
well O
for O
me O
is O
: O

You O
need O
to O
go O
to O
Mac O
Settings O
, O
and O
turn O
& O
# O
34;off&#34 O
; O
the O
laptop O
- O
speakers O
the O
first O
time O
, O
and O
activate O
the O
external O
port O
audio O
. O

This O
worked O
perfectly O
for O
connecting O
my O
macbook O
to O
my O
home O
theater O
system O
. O

I O
exchanged O
the O
Optoma O
2 O
times O
, O
and O
all O
three O
had O
HDMI O
signal O
drop O
issues O
and O
one O
had O
a O
dead O
remote O
. O

The O
iPod O
battery O
icon O
is O
marked O
as O
' O
charging O
' O
( O
or O
' O
plugged O
in O
' O
, O
with O
a O
full O
charge O
) O
and O
once O
the O
battery O
pack O
is O
drained O
, O
the O
normal O
diminishing O
battery O
icon O
shows.-Battery O
charger O
is O
USB O
, O
connects O
to O
computer O
or O
USB O
wall O
outlet O
adapter O
. O

Special O
mention O
was O
made O
of O
the O
side O
pockets O
that O
double O
over O
to O
provide O
safe O
storage O
for O
small O
items O
such O
as O
sunglasses O
. O

I O
absolutely O
loved O
the O
color O
and O
the O
top O
part O
was O
a O
perfect O
fit O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
into O
spending O
lots O
of O
time O
to O
get O
this O
device O
functioning O
, O
and O
are O
into O
unix O
/ O
linux O
, O
then O
do O
n't O
even O
think O
about O
buying O
this O
. O

Obviously O
the O
extended O
capacity O
in O
this O
battery O
lives O
up O
to O
BrainyDeal O
's O
promise O
. O

However O
, O
signal O
strength O
hovered O
between O
20 O
- O
40 O
% O
and O
frequent O
drop O
outs O
meant O
I O
had O
to O
hit O
refresh O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
to O
get O
a O
web O
page O
to O
load O
. O

Zoomingly O
fast O
. O

But O
that O
's O
all O
just O
minor O
detail O
type O
stuff O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
Asus O
Eee O
- O
PC O
to O
try O
out O
for O
our O
engineering O
department O
, O
which O
travels O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
adapter O
for O
use O
with O
my O
Plantronics O
CT O
14 O
, O
cordless O
phone O
/ O
dial O
pad O
. O

This O
card O
will O
stop O
working O
if O
the O
notebook O
has O
been O
on O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
and O
is O
hot O
. O

This O
is O
everything O
it O
's O
described O
to O
be O
. O

After O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
.. O
i O
received O
it O
back O
.. O

The O
mousepad O
is O
adequate O
, O
although O
the O
placement O
and O
engineering O
of O
the O
buttons O
could O
have O
been O
better O
. O

The O

Its O
a O
great O
quality O
fan O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
take O
off O
three O
stars O
for O
customer O
service O
. O

And O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
tuning O
you O
do O
in O
any O
dark O
projected O
scenes O
many O
shapes O
are O
outlined O
by O
a O
tiring O
green O
border O
. O

I O
have O
over O
30 O
years O
of O
experience O
with O
computers O
and O
electronics O
and O
after O
trying O
four O
different O
operating O
systems O
( O
WinXP O
, O
Win7 O
, O
Ubuntu O
and O
OSX O
) O
in O
32 O
and O
64 O
bit O
flavors O
on O
four O
different O
computers O

but O
like O
most O
people O
, O
I O
prefer O
a O
light O
that O
's O
not O
so O
bright O
. O

I O
really O
do O
hate O
it O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
LED O
status O
lights O
are O
useless O
. O

The O
zip O
pocket O
on O
the O
side O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
accomodate O
flash O
drives O
and O
an O
AC O
charger O
, O
although O
there O
will O
be O
a O
lump O
if O
the O
charger O
is O
large O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
network O
connection O
. O

At O
the O
price O
I O
was O
not O
expecting O
much O
, O
but O
was O
suprised O
after O
installing O
this O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
mini O
BoomBox O
for O
a O
several O
months O
now O
, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
how O
well O
it O
works O
! O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
put O
a O
zippered O
flap O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
bag O
for O
quick O
access O
to O
the O
camera O
like O
on O
the O
Lowepro O
Fastpack O
or O
Tamrac O
Aero O
Speed O
Pack O
. O

Oh O
and O
it O
fits O
my O
15 O
. O

I O
'm O
6'1 O
and O
the O
bag O
sits O
a O
little O
higher O
than O
I O
would O
really O
like O
it O
to O
. O

Qaality O
seemed O
fine O
and O
speed O
was O
great O
! O

I O
was O
curious O
to O
see O
what O
he O
had O
. O

No O
problems O
at O
all O
to O
report O
. O

I O
just O
had O
n't O
thought O
twice O
about O
how O
heavy O
it O
was O
. O

The O
top O
piece O
does O
not O
fit O
good O
. O

Longetivity O
not O
yet O
rated O
, O
but O
have O
hi O
expectations O

But O
together O
( O
plus O
keyboard O
) O

Seriously O
, O
have O
some O
people O
become O
so O
weak O
that O
they O
ca O
n't O
push O
a O
button O
? O

This O
looks O
just O
like O
the O
battery O
it O
replaced O
. O

To O
that O
end O
, O
will O
a O
silk O
top O
spending O
an O
hour O
with O
a O
Post O
- O
It O
label O
be O
permanently O
scarred O
, O
or O
will O
mere O
mortals O
fail O
to O
recognize O
any O
real O
difference O
? O

If O
the O
packaging O
and O
box O
was O
n't O
all O
banged O
up O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
keeping O
it O
for O
sure O
. O

This O
SD O
card O
works O
just O
as O
good O
, O
if O
not O
better O
than O
the O
SD O
cards O
. O

Samsung O
: O
Not O
to O
rush O
you O
, O
are O
we O
still O
connected O
on O
the O
chat O
? O

It O
's O
also O
solidly O
built O
. O

This O
fits O
well O
with O
the O
small O
room O
I O
keep O
my O
secondary O
TV O
in O
though O
, O
and O
it O
definitely O
beats O
using O
the O
TV O
's O
built O
in O
speaker O
! O

I O
had O
had O
to O
give O
you O
a O
recommendation O
, O
i O
'd O
say O
for O
with O
the O
1-size O
larger O
because O
that O
is O
a O
5-star O
buy O
! O

The O
bottom O
of O
the O
backpack O
has O
a O
sturdy O
, O
rubberized O
shell O
. O

6 O
- O
10 O
. O
8 O
, O
and O
this O
allowed O
me O
to O
fine O
tune O
the O
operation O
. O

Used O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
sit O
the O
workstation O
further O
away O
from O
me O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
people O
who O
work O
for O
HP O
go O
to O
Apple O
, O
people O
from O
Apple O
go O
to O
Lenovo O
, O
etc O
. O

le O

una O

Speaking O
of O
the O
keyboard O
, O
I O
still O
am O
not O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

Will O
try O
it O
next O
on O
my O
flat O
screen O
TV O
. O

My O
Brother O
was O
just O
Tickled O
! O

I O
watch O
TV O
in O
HD O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
Streaming O
video O
loads O
up O
quicker O
then O
ever O
before O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
charge O
my O
tablet O
& O
phone O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

People O
compliment O
the O
simplicity O
of O
this O
product O
, O
yet O
it O
does O
so O
much O
for O
the O
owner O
. O

I O
charged O
my O
iPhone O
from O
50 O
% O
in O
20 O
minutes O
and O
it O
still O
showed O
5 O
lights O
. O

Go O
ahead O
and O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
... O
order O
it O
now O
! O

love O
it O
) O
= O
more O
money O
too O

I O
'll O
update O
later O
. O

A O
slight O
bump O
will O
move O
it O
. O

I O
also O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
ordering O
RAM O
and O
a O
case O
for O
the O
netbook O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
accessories O
I O
have O
no O
further O
need O
of O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
those O
as O
well O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
it O
smells O
pretty O
intense O
for O
the O
first O
few O
days O
. O

and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

but O
I O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
right O
now O
because O
of O
some O
bug O
that O
causes O
Lion O
to O
freeze O
up O
when O
Chrome O
is O
used O
. O

The O
thinness O
really O
surprised O
me O
since O
my O
other O
tablets O
are O
at O
least O
twice O
as O
thick O
. O

Each O
time O
I O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
a O
little O
bit O
has O
dried O
out O
. O

BUT O
HERES O
THE O
WARNING O
.. O

I O
do O
have O
to O
use O
this O
product O
often O
, O
but O
that O
is O
more O
a O
product O
of O
my O
oily O
finger O
pads O
, O
not O
the O
eraser O
itself O
. O

I O
am O
a O
business O
guy O
and O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
notes O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
with O
other O
speakers O
and O
get O
the O
same O
noise O
over O
them O
too O
. O

I O
was O
concerned O
about O
the O
screen O
because O
some O
reviews O
said O
it O
was O
washed O
out O
. O

The O
2 O
. O
4 O
gighertz O
core O
2 O
duo O
is O
plenty O
fast O
for O
me O
. O

According O
to O
the O
manual O
you O
can O
daisy O
chain O
an O
unlimited O
number O
of O
this O
speakers O
and O
get O
a O
very O
intense O
sound O
. O

The O
case O
I O
received O
had O
a O
bright O
, O
deep O
yellow O
interior O
which O
was O
quite O
nice O
with O
the O
pink O
outside O
. O

Very O
nice O
and O
only O
set O
beck O
is O
I O
had O
to O
learn O
Windows O
8 O
which O
can O
really O
suck O
if O
you O
do O
not O
take O
a O
quick O
study O
on O
Windows O
8 O
. O

In O
conlusion O
i O
gave O
this O
model O
from O
toshiba O
2 O
very O
big O
thumbs O
down O
. O

The O
speed O
with O
signal O
strength O
of O
83 O
% O
for O
my O
location O
is O
equally O
fast O
as O
my O
hardwired O
Ethernet O
which O
is O
about O
to O
get O
stuffed O
into O
a O
closet O
and O
forgotten O
. O

It O
probably O
was O
in O
stock O
for O
the O
last O
4 O
to O
5 O
years O
instead O
. O
.. O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
all O
goofy O
on O
specs O
and O
design O
. O

I O
cleaned O
my O
keyboard O
with O
rubbing O
alcohol O
, O
so O
CLEAN O
NOW O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
memory O
for O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
15 O
in O
i7 O

RPM O
hard O
drives O
, O
for O
years O
upon O
years O
I O
have O
always O
upgraded O
my O
hard O
drives O
in O
my O
laptops O
and O
play O
stations O
because O
I O
always O
want O
to O
have O
the O
fastest O
load O
speeds O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
compile O
and O
run O
your O
own O
programs O
, O
install O
the O
include O
XCode O
tools O
, O
which O
comes O
with O
gcc O
compilers O
and O
X11 O
( O
xwindows O
server O
) O
. O

This O
Mac O
has O
performed O
flawless O
since O
day O
one O
, O
no O
crashes O
, O
no O
frozen O
screens O
, O
no O
hard O
drive O
sounds O
or O
fan O
noises O
. O

The O
bag O
itself O
is O
very O
big O
. O

to/1iwMEoV O
with O
CPU O
have O
a O
score O
of O
2300 O
( O
way O
much O
cheaper O
, O
nicer O
design O
) O

I O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
Modern O
Progressive O
and O
Alternative O
Rock O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Electronic O
and O
Classical O
. O

The O
price O
difference O
is O
insignificant O
and O
very O
rarely O
have O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
someone O
buying O
a O
bigger O
TV O
than O
what O
they O
wanted O
and O
complained O
about O
it O
later O
. O

Compact O
size O
. O

Someone O
really O
cheeped O
out O
on O
this O
one O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
a O
very O
old O
laptop O
without O
built O
in O
wireless O
. O

The O
case O
fits O
well O
and O
I O
think O
this O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
for O
the O
price O
. O

This O
is O
essentially O
a O
speaker O
that O
is O
not O
connected O
to O
the O
power O
amp O
, O

Other O
plusses O
were O
the O
HDMI O
and O
firewire O
ports O
, O
and O
the O
built O
- O
in O
Bluetooth O
and O
wireless O
( O
almost O
a O
given O
nowadays O
, O
but O
you O
never O
know).So O
, O

DOESNT O
CONNECT O
WELLL O
.... O

I O
got O
this O
speaker O
dock O
during O
a O
Gold O
Box O
deal O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

About O
5 O
mins O
had O
went O
by O
and O
the O
sound O
came O
back O
but O
this O
time O
it O
shut O
itself O
off O
. O

I&#8217;d O
recommend O
this O
device O
to O
anyone O

This O
thing O
allows O
dual O
monitors O
with O
my O
ASUS O
laptop O
. O

you O
could O
be O
toast O
. O

Performance O
is O
excellent O
. O

so O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
defective O

Second O
observation O
: O

At O
this O
size O
( O
10 O
. O
1 O
inch O
) O
and O
with O
these O
specs O
( O
battery O
life O
, O
memory O
, O
etc O
. O
) O

I O
have O
a O
17 O
" O
gateway O
and O
it O
fit O
perfectly O
. O

Plug O
Ethernet O
cable O
into O
router O
and O
power O
on O
( O
order O
does O
not O
matter O
) O
. O

So O
far O
this O
adapter O
has O
done O
exactly O
what O
I O
bought O
it O
to O
do O
quite O
well O
; O
connect O
wiimotes O
for O
use O
with O
Dolphin O
and O
work O
seemlessly O
in O
Kubuntu O
12 O
. O

The O
Asus O
Zenbook O
UX31E O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
most O
aesthetically O
pleasing O
ultrabook O
/ O
notebooks O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
come O
across O
. O

IT O
would O
be O
really O
useful O
for O
this O
purpose O
rather O
than O
just O
a O
notebook O
stand O
thing O

It O
runs O
quiet O
and O
stays O
cool O
all O
right O
. O

Tiny O
, O
but O
very O
ergonomic O
! O

I O
have O
the O
Corsair O
16 O
gb O
memory O
WORKING O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
I O
have O
gone O
wrong O
somewhere O
in O
the O
set O
- O
up O
procedure O
... O

This O
is O
a O
must O
have O
for O
anyone O
traveling O
with O
their O
tablet O
. O

It O
has O
a O
video O
light O
, O
but O
it O
is O
weak O
- O
good O
only O
to O
about O
5 O
feet O
. O

Its O
good O
, O
but O
if O
you O
put O
it O
to O
sleep O
it O
does O
n't O
give O
you O
any O
alerts O
because O
it O
turns O
off O
the O
WiFi O
connection O
and O
ca O
n't O
get O
calls O
. O

The O
limited O
software O
however O
means O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
ditching O
my O
real O
computer O
anytime O
soon O
. O

oh O
well O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
neat O
that O
two O
windows O
could O
be O
opened O
side O
by O
side O
, O
each O
taking O
only O
half O
the O
space O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

At O
times O
I O
am O
so O
frustrated O
with O
this O
machine O
that O
I O
go O
to O
my O
old O
Acer O
laptop O
which O
was O
much O
cheaper O
and O
less O
powerful O
, O
but O
works O
more O
efficiently O
then O
the O
Asus O
. O

Neither O
feel O
like O
they O
get O
in O
the O
way O
of O
using O
the O
computer O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
all O
up O
for O
anyone O
considering O
the O
Google O
Chromebook O
the O
main O
point O
of O
getting O
a O
Chromebook O
for O
me O
was O
simply O
surfing O
the O
web O
and O
receiving O
/ O
sending O
email O
. O

a O
lotbecause O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
reach O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
its O
location O
is O
convenient O
. O

At O
higher O
volumes O
it O
sounds O
ok O
. O

Despite O
the O
books O
, O
the O
bumping O
, O
the O
thumping O
, O
and O
the O
rattling O
around O
, O
my O
laptop O
remains O
unfettered O
. O

Battery O
life O
has O
diminished O
a O
tad O
, O
but O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

You O
know O
it O
's O
good O
when O
you O
see O
the O
Windows O
Performance O
scores O
of O
5 O
. O

So O
, O
picture O
that O
you O
're O
working O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
and O
you O
've O
sort O
of O
leaned O
back O
in O
your O
chair O
while O
working O
. O

like O
if O
you O
slam O
it O
around O
at O
all O
, O
it O
will O
likely O
pick O
up O
a O
myriad O
of O
scratches O
. O

x O
is O
fast O
enough O
to O
provide O
you O
the O
speed O
you O
need O
( O
I O
use O
one O
SSD O
to O
run O
the O
latest O
games O
on O
, O
with O
no O
hiccups O
) O

I O
m O
not O
sure O
about O
other O
people O
that O
had O
problems O
, O
but O

I O
next O
eliminated O
the O
Swiss O
Gear O
Pegasus O
( O
a O
great O
looking O
bag O
) O
from O
consideration O
, O
for O
while O
it O
was O
clearly O
designed O
for O
carrying O
very O
large O
laptops O
( O
17 O
" O
) O
, O
aside O
from O
the O
computer O
, O
this O
bag O
was O
obviously O
meant O
to O
hold O
generally O
flat O
things O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
computer O
for O
accessing O
the O
Web O
, O
readng O
e O
- O
mail O
( O
but O
not O
answering O
it O
) O
. O

This O
cable O
is O
tough O
, O
no O
quality O
is O
lost O
from O
one O
end O
to O
the O
other O
, O
and O
it O
works O
. O

Do O
n't O
expect O
an O
atom O
thin O
invisible O
shield O
which O
feels O
as O
the O
glass O
did O
. O

Pros O
: O
Price O

Keyboard O
is O
as O
large O
as O
can O
be O
to O
work O
with O
iPad O
as O
it O
is O
designed O
. O

I O
shudder O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
how O
desktops O
without O
touch O
screens O
manage O
to O
use O
Windows O
8 O
. O

Our O
home O
theater O
has O
a O
subwoofer O
, O
so O
the O
speaker O
setup O
for O
the O
DVD O
player O
specified O
small O
for O
our O
front O
speakers O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
runs O
cooler O
than O
the O
C710 O
and O
many O
other O
low O
- O
end O
laptops O
, O
it O
still O
gets O
warm O
on O
your O
lap O
, O
but O
not O
annoyingly O
so.- O
The O
screen O
and O
its O
glossy O
black O
border O
suffer O
from O
keyboard O
and O
bezel O
marks O
. O

Speed O
is O
very O
good O
. O

Playing O
games O
or O
doing O
other O
processor O
- O
intensive O
activities O
causes O
the O
fan O
in O
my O
laptop O
to O
really O
spin O
up O

The O
added O
storage O
space O
is O
great O
considering O

For O
the O
price O
it O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
item O
. O

I O
swapped O
this O
cable O
out O
for O
an O
extension O
amazon O
basics O
cable O
I O
purchased O
instead O
and O

( O
' O
gparted O
' O
will O
allow O
them O
to O
be O
realigned O
) O

The O
cooling O
fan O
vents O
are O
located O
on O
the O
front O
half O
of O
the O
cooler O
, O
which O
is O
not O
great O
for O
MacBook O
Pro O
owners O
since O
most O
MBPs O
have O
their O
hottest O
bottom O
surfaces O
towards O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
computer O
( O
where O
the O
LCD O
panel O
hinges O
) O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
now O
for O
a O
few O
months O
( O
4 O
? O
maybe O
) O
and O
the O
leather O
underneath O
the O
screen O
is O
starting O
to O

a O
little O

Then O
it O
just O
turned O
off O
without O
any O
reason O
that O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
find O
. O

Best O
part O
is O
it O
has O
more O

and O
the O
accessories O
are O
significantly O
cheaper O
. O

so O
maybe O
the O

This O

and O

. O

I O
have O
an O
HTC O
Evo O

It O
's O
a O
small O
bag O
that O
holds O
a O
lot O
. O

Do O
n't O
expect O
to O
use O
it O
as O
a O
normal O

because O
it O
is O
compact O
. O

I O
do O
have O
plenty O

and O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
answer O
any O
questions O
that O

Battery O

The O

ships O
with O
a O
plain O
( O

; O
their O
transceiver O
plugs O
into O
one O
of O
only O
( O
3 O
) O
available O
USB O
ports O
. O

and O
I O
might O
update O
this O
review O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Switched O
to O
this O
USB O
device O
and O
got O
54 O
M O
consistently O
. O

The O
apple O
logo O
is O
visible O
thru O
the O
cover O
especially O
when O
illuminated O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
a O
fairly O
specialized O
cable O
that O
not O
so O
many O
people O
will O
use O
, O
but O
it O
served O
my O
purposes O
perfectly O
. O

( O
the O
battery O
will O
still O
drain).Some O
additional O
observations O

The O

. O

Simple O
, O
inexpensive O
and O
works O
well O
. O

I O
would O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
for O
the O
compact O
size O
, O
usefulness O
as O
a O
Kindle O
charging O
station O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
is O
pretty O
good O
; O
but O
the O
alarm O
shutoff O
button O
is O
annoying O
. O

The O
4-pin O
cables O
were O
long O
enough O
to O
reach O
the O
drives O
, O
which O
are O
all O
the O
way O
in O
the O
bottom O
bays O
, O
without O
straining O
at O
all O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
amplified O
and O
in O
a O
quiet O
room O
are O
loud O
enough O
with O
my O
iPod O
turned O
up O
less O
than O
half O
way O
. O

The O
picture O
went O
on O
and O
off O
whenever O
someone O
walked O
into O
the O
room O
, O
causing O
my O
wife O
and O
me O
to O
condemn O
the O
TV O
set O
or O
the O
Time O
- O
Warner O
cable O
box O
. O

, O
it O
has O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
lining O
to O
caress O
the O
expensive O
curves O
of O
my O
baby O
. O

I O
am O
expecting O
fan O
to O
get O
stuck O
very O
soon O
. O

I O
'm O
into O
the O
ACER O
line O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
in O
school O
. O

Whereas O
Windows O
7 O
Starter O
took O
several O
minutes O
to O
boot O
and O
log O
in O
, O
Lubuntu O
is O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
's O
astounding O
. O

I O
like O
the O
side O
entry O
laptop O
compartment O
. O

Windows O
7 O
seems O
very O
solid O
. O

It O
was O
also O
more O
noticeable O
when O
the O
speakers O
were O
in O
an O
open O
environment O
. O

The O
MX O
feels O
better O
but O
VX O
works O
better O
now.- O
Works O
great O
with O
LINUX O
through O
BTNX- O
Small O
case O
for O
carring O
the O
VX O
around O
. O

I O
need O
to O
change O
the O
safe O
volume O
to O
nearly O
90 O
% O
of O
the O
capability O
of O
the O
iPod O
to O
get O
to O
a O
decent O
loudness O
for O
some O
tracks O
; O
and O
no O
I O
am O
not O
a O
loudness O
freak O
and O
wish O
not O
to O
risk O
hearing O
loss O
for O
any O
music O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
product O
, O
it O
's O
simply O
a O
home O
run O
for O
the O
consumer O
who O
needs O
more O
USB O
ports O
, O
and O
yet O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
a O
" O
permanent O
" O
solution O
like O
an O
additional O
USB O
PCI O
- O
Express O
card O
installed O
in O
the O
G5 O
PowerMac O

I O
bought O
this O
recently O
for O
my O
Canon O
HF100 O
. O

The O
screen O
has O
darkened O
a O
little O
, O
kind O
of O
like O
looking O
through O
sunglasses O
, O
but O
eventually O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
and O
forget O
that O
you O
have O
the O
screen O
on O
. O

It O
's O
a O
breeze O
to O
use O
and O

People O
complain O
that O
it O
is O
a O
pain O
but O
seriously O
how O
much O
effort O
does O
it O
take O
to O
click O
a O
button O
on O
the O
mouse O
to O
wake O
it O
up O
? O

I O
worried O
that O
these O
would O
be O
drawbacks O
as O
I O
have O
always O
had O
them O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

Very O
sturdy O
adapters O
, O
the O
good O
thing O
is O
they O
have O
2 O
plugs O
each O
, O
you O
can O
charge O
two O
things O
on O
one O
adapter O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
the O
HP O
Chromebook O
11 O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
now O
. O

and O
I O
found O
this O
one O
and O
its O
better O
than O
spending O
-100 O
or O
even O
100 O
- O
200 O
on O
a O
simple O
mic O
just O
get O
this O

Only O
wish O
it O
had O
room O
for O
a O
standard O
file O
folder O
. O

After O
several O
weeks O
of O
daily O
use O
, O
no O
other O
drops O
out O
of O
my O
LAN O
have O
been O
experienced O
. O

The O
flexibly O
camera O
base O
really O
put O
this O
webcam O
in O
a O
class O
of O
its O
own O

This O
battery O
does O
n't O
last O
as O
long O
as O
the O
original O
battery O
however O
it O
's O
85 O
% O
of O
the O
original O
for O
35 O
% O
of O
the O
cost O
. O

Bought O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
original O
power O
supply O
which O
suddenly O
disintegrated O
after O
4 O
years O
of O
likely O
abuse O
by O
the O
family O
. O

It O
also O
does O
a O
great O
job O
of O
cooling O
, O
although O
the O
fans O
get O
somewhat O
noisy O
if O
you O
increase O
the O
speed O
too O
much O
. O

Good O
luck O
finding O
a O
leather O
case O
for O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
drive O
. O

in O
vehicle O
for O
bluetooth O
phone O
pickup O
. O

Then O
weather O
is O
n't O
an O
issue O
and O
I O
get O
the O
best O
reception O
possible O
. O

This O
fit O
the O
screen O
perfectly O
and O
does O
n't O
block O
off O
any O
part O
of O
the O
monitor O
frame O
or O
access O
to O
any O
of O
the O
buttons O
. O

However O
, O
when O
weighing O
the O
positives O
and O
the O
price O
against O
the O
flaws O
, O
I O
would O
still O
give O
this O
keyboard O
a O
solid O
4 O
out O
of O
5 O
stars O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
eliminate O
having O
to O
have O
a O
regular O
headset O

While O
this O
is O
great O
for O
me O
, O
it O
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
an O
issue O
for O
others O
who O
use O
a O
shell O
cover O
on O
their O
Air O
or O
who O
have O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
my O
cell O
phone O
cord O
right O
next O
to O
my O
bed O
. O

Only O
thing O
I O
dislike O
is O
the O
amount O
of O
space O
inside O
the O
bag O
- O
I O
could O
fit O
one O
textbook O
and O
my O
laptop O
inside O
of O
it O
, O
and O
nothing O
else O
. O

This O
backpack O
is O
strong O
durable O
and O
well O
built O
. O

Samsung O
LED O
LCD O
tv O
's O
are O
out O

Still O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
and O
see O
if O
I O
might O
be O
inclined O
to O
switch O
to O
a O
true O
backpack O
. O

The O
colors O
are O
just O
dull O
, O
and O
also O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
burning O
or O
ripping O
the O
BD O
- O
ROM O
drive O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
slower O
than O
an O
average O
DVD O
Burner O
, O
also O
reading O
discs O
is O
painfully O
slow O
. O

The O
LifeCam O
VX-5000 O
meets O
or O
exceeds O
my O
expectations O
in O
every O
way O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
very O
clear O
and O
the O
sound O
from O
those O
speakers O
are O
great O
. O

- O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
service O
( O
saves O
going O
to O
Best O
Buy O
and O

other O

newthe O

box O

this O
item O
as O

4/6 O
in O

ratingso O
now O

I O
have O
wanted O
a O
Macbook O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Perfect O
fit O
and O
brought O
my O
laptop O
back O
to O
life O
. O

Games O
run O
beautifully O
with O
no O
lag O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
start O
to O
get O
other O
signals O
which O
are O
not O
detected O
before O
. O

The O
instructions O
show O
both O
touch O

, O
touchpad O
, O
and O
keyboard O
. O

I O
personally O
do O
not O
feel O
there O
is O
a O
better O
laptop O
out O
there O
for O
the O
reasons O
in O
which O
I O
will O
list O
shortly O
. O

I O
ORDER O
SOMETHING O
OF O
THIS O
NATURE O
- O
- O
- O
THEREFORE O
, O
COME O
THE O
NAME O
OF O
MY O
TITLE O
FOR O

Thus O
far O
, O
the O
product O
is O
simply O
superb O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
boot O
super O
fast O
over O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
, O
but O
as O
long O
as O
it O
boots O
is O
all O
you O
care O
about O
. O

Easy O
to O
use O
, O
and O
FAST O
too O
! O

They O
provided O
a O
big O
rubber O
foot O
to O
keep O
the O
dock O
from O
slipping O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
but O
a O
rubberized O
surface O
on O
top O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
to O
prevent O
your O
notebook O
from O
slipping O
off O
the O
dock O
. O

Bought O
this O
product O
as O
a O
gift O
to O
my O
wife O
. O

I O
tell O
others O
that O
they O
are O
worth O
having O
, O
but O
some O
people O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
would O
like O
something O
so O
little O
. O

and O
I O
can O
unzip O
it O
and O
leave O
the O
case O
inside O
my O
luggage O
while O
I O
use O
the O
laptop O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
replacement O
for O
my O
broken O
laptop O
keyboard O
works O
just O
like O
new O
. O

I O
use O
it O
everyday O
with O
my O
macbook O
air O
. O

After O
two O
weeks O
, O
I O
received O
a O
RMA O
authorization O
and O
returned O
the O
unit O
. O

I O
got O
a O
tip O
to O
fit O
, O
but O
even O
when O
the O
Lenmar O
was O
completely O
full O
, O
the O
charging O
sign O
went O
on O
and O
off O
with O
the O
display O
flickering O
every O
few O
seconds O
as O
it O
alternated O
between O
automatic O
power O
modes O
, O
thinking O
it O
had O
power O
then O
no O
power O
etc O
... O
the O
charging O
light O
never O
stayed O
on O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
laptop O
ever O
, O
so O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
except O
for O
my O
desktop O
computer O
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
speakers O
are O
located O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
device O
, O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
how O
well O
they O
projected O
sound O
. O

Oh O
and O
I O
suppose O
I O
did O
n't O
mention O
this O

I O
'm O
glad O
you O
guys O
offered O
an O
affordable O
aftermarket O
product O
that O
is O
reliable O
and O
backed O
by O
a O
great O
warranty O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
edit O
reviews O

I O
actually O
get O
better O
range O
with O
this O
little O
guy O
than O
a O
1 O
meter O
26dbi O
parabolic O
dish O
antenna O
hooked O
to O
an O
Alfa O
2000mw O
USB O
adaptor O
. O

So O
I O
initially O
ran O
a O
pair O
of O
tiny O
, O
external O
' O
HP O
Mini O
' O
speakers O
, O
which O
sounded O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
TV O
's O
. O

I O
like O
the O
6 O
foot O
length O
. O

so O
this O
bag O
is O
big O
enough O
for O
all O
the O
things O
I O
need O
to O
take O
with O
me O

With O
5 O
adults O
and O
as O
many O
children O
, O
there O
always O
seemed O
to O
be O
something O
that O
was O
running O
out O
of O
juice O
and O
this O
charger O
kept O
us O
from O
fighting O
over O
the O
few O
wall O
sockets O
where O
we O
were O
staying O
. O

It O
could O
be O
more O
heavy O
- O
duty O
in O
my O
opinion O
but O
it O
works O
well O
and O
you O
're O
not O
carrying O
a O
ton O
of O
bricks O
anyway O
... O

Great O
buy O
, O
great O
value O
, O
and O
a O
perfect O
universal O
charger O
to O
keep O
on O
hand O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
drivers O
installed O
, O
but O
not O
all O
. O

Never O
had O
this O
problem O
with O
my O
previous O
laptop O
and O
Windows O
Vista O
, O
ever O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
thus O
far O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

The O
touch O
pad O
is O
smartly O
designed O
, O
a O
double O
tap O
in O
one O
corner O
will O
lock O
it O
, O
and O
you O
can O
pinch O
your O
fingers O
inward O
or O
outward O
for O
easy O
- O
zooming O
in O
, O
and O
two O
fingers O
drawn O
up O
or O
down O
controls O
scroll O
. O

I O
also O
had O
another O
issue O
when O
the O
I O
closed O
the O
lid O
the O
laptop O
would O
randomly O
launch O
software O
icons O
I O
had O
pinned O
to O
the O
desktop O
. O

This O
works O
perfectly O
. O

The O
product O
sound O
is O
good O
. O

it O
performs O
very O
well O
for O
my O
business O
usage O
, O
which O
is O
mostly O
spreadsheets O
, O
word O
processing O
, O
email O
, O
and O
general O
internet O
research O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
put O
a O
bottle O
inside O
where O
it O
can O
get O
stuff O
wet O
. O

The O
lighted O
keyboard O
is O
so O
useful O
for O
working O
in O
a O
dimly O
lit O
room O
. O

This O
is O
exactly O
the O
part O
I O
needed O
and O
it O
was O
shipped O
well O
. O

With O
Chrome O
OS O
boots O
fast O
and O
browser O
via O
wifi O
fast O
too O
. O

Functionality O
is O
terrible O
. O

My O
computer O
operates O
just O
the O
same O
on O
its O
little O
grate O
, O
however O
, O
so O
I O
chalk O
this O
wasted O
gift O
certificate O
up O
to O
" O
live O
and O
learn O
" O
. O

Sadly O
, O
H O
/ O
K O
made O
some O
new O
, O
and O
one O
very O
old O
, O
mistakes O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
it O
will O
only O
last O
a O
few O
months O
tops O
. O

I O
have O
my O
laptop O
next O
to O
the O
desktop O

I O
know O
it O
was O
an O
automated O
e O
- O
mail O
, O

I O
ca O
n't O
recommend O
this O
at O
all O
. O

However O
, O
I O
was O
so O
disappointed O
with O
this O
product O
. O

I O
ordered O
it O
for O
my O
Kindle O
Fire O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
that O
. O

No O
" O
powered O
by O
" O
stickers O
, O
no O
ugly O
graphics O
. O

I O
would O
describe O
it O
as O
an O
outstanding O
fit O
! O

Great O
for O
the O
internet O
. O

, O
it O
's O
easier O
on O
my O
back O
/ O
eyes O
and O
this O
screen O
is O
vibrant O
and O
clear O
as O
a O
bell O
. O

I O
thought O
perhaps O
this O
might O
be O
useful O
for O
corralling O
some O
of O
the O
mess O

Again O
- O
very O
secure O
- O
since O
any O
thief O
would O
need O
2 O
hands O
and O
and O
some O
time O
to O
get O
a O
pocket O
open O
. O

The O
machine O
could O
use O
1 O
or O
2 O
more O
USB O
ports O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
quite O
well O
. O

you O
could O
use O
it O
for O
only O
one O
thing O
, O
zoom O
or O
brush O
size O
or O
a O
few O
other O
options O
. O

A O
tivo O
will O
cost O
me O
$ O
299 O
plus O
a O
monthly O
cost O
. O

I O
looked O
a O
bit O
- O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
& O
# O
34;1080P&#34 O
; O

6GHz O
Core O
i5 O
, O
which O
is O
a O
bonus O
. O

I O
tried O
different O
tools O
to O
refresh O
and O
shake O
the O
problem O
off O
to O
no O
avail O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
your O
Asus O
Transformer O
tablet O
this O
is O
a O
must O
- O
have O
. O

I O
purposefully O
steered O
away O
from O
other O
models O
where O
the O
speakers O
were O
in O
the O
bottom O
, O
or O
out O
the O
side O
, O
these O
are O
mounted O
on O
either O
side O
, O
and O
project O
toward O
the O
front O
, O
stereo O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
I O
am O
enjoying O
a O
rich O
, O
full O
quality O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
, O
especially O
when O
I O
put O
on O
the O
satellite O
music O
channels O
. O

Nothing O
else O
is O
quite O
like O
it O
terms O
of O
sound O
quality O
and O
volume O
. O

I O
only O
tried O
this O
mouse O
because O
I O
had O
amazon O
rewards O
points O
. O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
a O
touchscreen O
computer O
, O
as O
that O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
way O
things O
are O
moving O
anyway O
with O
the O
increasing O
prevalence O
of O
smartphones O
and O
tablets O
compared O
to O
conventional O
computers O
. O

I O
absolutely O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

I O
have O
had O
NO O
random O
reboots O
, O
and O
only O
a O
few O
force O
closes O
of O
apps O
( O
Mainly O
the O
CNN O
app O
) O
. O

it O
has O
reduced O
the O
heat O
in O
these O
areas O
considerably O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
see O
the O
laptop O
on O
the O
HD O
TV O
screen O
sure O
makes O
it O
big O

It O
's O
smart O
and O
professional O
looking O
and O
has O
lots O
of O
sex O
appeal O
too O
. O

Cheap O
and O
works O
perfectly O
! O

6 O
feet O
long O
so O

I O
loaded O
my O
extensive O
music O
library O
onto O
it O
as O
a O
backup O
, O
and O
I O
plug O
it O
in O
to O
play O
songs O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
case O
! O
! O

This O
is O
lightweight O
and O
the O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
it O
is O
so O
small O
it O
wo O
n't O
fit O
in O
a O
normal O
old O
laptop O
bag O
because O
of O
its O
size O
. O

Another O
neat O
feature O
is O
that O
even O
though O
you O
have O
to O
take O
a O
USB O
slot O
from O
your O
computer O
, O
the O
cooling O
pad O
gives O
you O
an O
extra O
USB O
slot O
to O
use O
in O
it O
's O
place O
! O

Well O
, O
I O
am O
really O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
problem O
I O
started O
having O
was O
the O
huge O
main O
zipper O
, O
eventually O
it O
will O
start O
separating O
. O

As O
a O
laptop O
protector O
, O
this O
bag O
does O
a O
poor O
job O
. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
like O
it O

This O
function O
gets O
very O
annoying O
when O
you O
are O
writing O
. O

I O
like O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
long O
cord O
taking O
up O
space O
, O
since O
I O
'm O
a O
pretty O
much O
organized O
person O
& O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
may O
appliances O
to O
hook O
up O

Is O
it O
a O
good O
investment O
? O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
Bluetooth O
4 O
. O

All O
items O
should O
be O
made O
this O
: O
simple O
, O
effective O
and O
reliable O
. O

Definitely O
an O
essential O
for O
taking O
your O
tablet O
to O
the O
next O
level O
. O

This O
lack O
of O
brightness O
really O
bothered O
me O
, O
so O
I O
will O
almost O
always O
use O
the O
enhanced O
graphics O
mode O
. O

I O
still O
have O
to O
get O
one O
as O
a O
carrying O
case O
with O
a O
shoulder O
strap O

In O
other O
words O
, O
you O
can O
not O
charge O
the O
Vita O
with O
this O
product O
alone O
! O

The O
key O
cover O
fits O
nicely O
and O
the O
case O
snaps O
right O
on O
. O

Definitely O
would O
not O
purchase O
or O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
else O
. O

Nothing O
get O
's O
lost O
, O
looks O
good O
, O
comfortable O
and O
easy O
to O
hang O
on O
to O
. O

After O
receiving O
it O
I O
immediately O
attempted O
to O
lay O
down O
a O
clean O
install O
of O
Windows O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
junk O
that O
Sony O
installs O
by O
default O
on O
their O
laptops O
. O

IT O
's O
quiet O
( O
compare O
to O
my O
previous O
one O
) O
and O
charges O
fast O
. O

Keeps O
scratches O
away O
and O
its O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
exposed O
edges O
around O
the O
usb O
port O
. O

Was O
brought O
for O
some O
who O
says O
they O
are O
enjoying O
it O
tremendously O
. O

I O
restored O
the O
computer O
to O
three O
days O
prior O
and O
the O
adapter O
was O
still O
absent O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
clean O
and O
focused O
and O
the O
adjustable O
sub O
is O
just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

After O
researching O
different O
sites O
and O
reading O
reviews O
for O
literally O
around O
30 O
different O
keyboard O
cases O
, O
this O
was O
my O
third O
( O
and O
final O
! O
) O
attempt O
to O
find O
the O
best O
case O
for O
me O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
it O
has O
been O
pretty O
much O
flawless O
. O

I O
have O
read O
some O
comments O
about O
this O
RAM O
being O
1 O
. O

but O
I O
eventually O
got O
it O
to O
work O
. O

You O
have O
to O
go O
through O
a O
setup O
procedure O
everytime O
you O
want O
to O
rebroadcast O
a O
new O
WiFi O
signal O
which O
takes O
several O
minutes O
and O
the O
R36 O
has O
to O
be O
plugged O
into O
your O
laptop O
via O
a O
CAT5 O
cable O
to O
do O
it O
. O

but O
you O
can O
definitely O
fit O
a O
much O
bigger O
laptop O
in O
here O
also O
) O
, O
1 O
- O
2 O
textbooks O
, O
a O
few O
binders O
/ O
notebooks O
, O
my O
Apple O
iPad O
, O
and O
then O
utilities O
such O
as O
my O
graphing O
calculator O
, O
headphones O
, O
pens O
, O
pencils O
, O
notecards O
, O
flash O
drive O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
compartments O
are O
adjustable O
and O
easily O
fit O
my O
full O
frame O
DSLR O
, O
extra O
batteries O
, O
a O
second O
lens O
and O
some O
snacks O
. O

Fantastic O
Camera O
. O

but O
it O
's O
matted O
& O
can O
not O
be O
configured O
with O
significantly O
brighter O
screen O
. O

So O
the O
iPhone O
, O
for O
example O
, O
needs O
a O
5W O
draw O
and O
therefore O
, O
even O
plugged O
in O
to O
a O
90W O
adapter O
, O
will O
only O
draw O
5W. O

The O
inside O
is O
lightly O
padded O
, O
but O
sufficient O
to O
protect O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
the O
foggiest O
if O
this O
is O
a O
Linux O
shortcoming O
, O
an O
Intel O
graphics O
shortcoming O
, O
or O
an O
Xorg O
shortcoming O
. O

My O
recommendations O
: O
This O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
an O
old O
codger O
like O
me O
who O
is O
going O
to O
treat O
it O
gently O
. O

Well O
, O
unless O
you O
read O
this O
review O
first O
. O

Unless O
you O
upgrade O
to O
laptop O
level O
battery O
extender O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
the O
same O
with O
any O
other O
similar O
device O
. O

Anyway O
here O
are O
the O
main O
sticking O
points O
for O
me O
: O
Cons:-Very O
reflective O
screen O
. O

The O
added O
value O
is O
in O
ease O
- O
of O
- O
installation O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

Aside O
from O
that O
wish O
, O
the O
thing O
works O
as O
advertised O
. O

So O
no O
need O
to O
go O
into O
that O
. O

Overall O
if O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
go O
only O
for O
the O
case O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
better O
suited O
for O
laptops O
with O
vents O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
cheap O
and O
small O
but O
it O
works O
. O

Amazon O
is O
taking O
the O
return O
no O
problem O
, O
and O
I O
will O
be O
ordering O
a O
replacement O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
bag O
is O
narrow O
- O
ish O
, O
and O
so O
_ O
some O
_ O
waste O
of O
space O
seems O
inevitable O
when O
placing O
the O
dividers O
( O
with O
velcro O
) O
. O

Nice O
size O
/ O
volume O
ratio O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
a O
zoom O
function O
, O
but O
the O
mic O
works O
from O
a O
few O
feet O
away O
and O
the O
cam O
quality O
is O
decent O
. O

you O
need O
if O
you O
register O
the O
charger O
. O

Neither O
machine O
has O
a O
DVD O
drive O
, O
however O
, O
so O
I O
bought O
a O
bus O
- O
powered O
USB O
external O
DVD O
drive O
from O
LG O
which O
I O
can O
use O
to O
watch O
movies O
on O
either O
system O
. O

this O
would O
be O
a O
good O
second O

The O
headphone O
jack O
on O
the O
front O
is O
handy O
, O
too O
. O

The O
call O
quality O
is O
lacking O
on O
the O
mic O
end O
of O
it O
. O

Expensive O
ultrabooks O
always O
take O
most O
of O
these O
ports O
away O
. O

It O
's O
as O
attractive O
as O
something O
like O
this O

Let O
me O
start O
out O
by O
stating O
that O
this O
is O
not O
really O
suited O
for O
a O
big O
guy O
's O
hand O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
finding O
this O
screen O
from O
the O
numbers O
on O
the O
back O
of O
my O
broken O
screen O
and O
walla O
. O

I O
also O
have O
the O
Apple O
IR O
remote O
for O
my O
2010 O
iMac O
and O
the O
design O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
Apple O
remote O

It O
got O
as O
good O
or O
better O
reviews O
as O
the O
other O
passive O
3D O
monitors O
out O
there O
and O
was O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
many O
of O
them O
. O

With O
4 O
casters O
those O
bags O
can O
roll O
in O
any O
direction O
-- O
which O
really O
is O
n't O
always O
desirable O
-- O
and O
when O
you O
tip O
them O
so O
you O
can O
walk O
fast O
, O
you O
've O
got O
the O
other O
two O
casters O
hanging O
in O
the O
air O
. O

Worked O
right O
away O
on O
a O
Dell O
running O
Ubuntu O
( O
not O
that O
that O
really O
matters O
, O
but O
some O
Mac O
users O
are O
saying O
unamplified O
mics O
do O
n't O
work O
with O
Macs O
) O
. O

and O
it O
fits O
considerably O
better O
. O

After O
waiting O
nearly O
two O
weeks O
for O
my O
order O
to O
finally O
show O
up O
, O
I O
installed O
it O
into O
the O
back O
of O
the O
laptop O
to O
give O
it O

Separate O
padded O
compartments O
for O
your O
laptop O
and O

your O
important O
items O
secure O
and O
protected O
while O
offering O
plenty O
of O
space O
to O
pack O
away O
other O
essentials O
. O

( O
If O
you O
understand O
photography O
, O
I O
mean O
that O
the O

protector O
gave O
my O
screen O

the O
fuzzy O

rather O
not O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
possibly O
returning O
this O
item O
, O
but O
I O
will O
remember O
to O
not O
buy O
this O
type O
of O
product O
or O
buy O
from O
this O
seller O
( O

Update O
: O
I O
spent O
about O
an O
hour O
Chatting O
with O
someone O
named O
James O
at O
Toshiba O
Platinum O
Support O
. O

And O
helps O
the O
risk O
of O
damaging O
the O
cords O
! O

Since O
you O
'll O
only O
need O
to O
use O
one O
receiver O
, O
all O
of O
Logitech O
's O
current O
" O
Unified O
Receiver O
" O
products O
come O
with O
built O
- O
in O
safe O
storage O
for O
the O
extra O
USB O
receiver O
-- O
nicely O
done O
folks!)Note O
: O
if O
you O
have O
n't O
yet O
looked O
at O
the O
Logitech O

I O
gave O
it O
4 O
stars O
because O
the O
recording O
pull O
down O
my O
system O
performance O
and O
gives O
only O
mpg O
file O
. O

This O
is O
the O
part O
that O
messed O
me O
up O
for O
2 O
hours O
! O

Good O
stuff O
. O

I O
purchase O
this O
cable O
for O
my O
office O
samsung O
galaxy O
tab O
3 O
8 O
inches O
. O

That O
explains O
why O
I O
have O
been O
through O
4 O
BT O
adapters O
and O
none O
worked O
. O

1 O
combo O
eSATA O
or O
USB O

But O
the O
extra O
use O
we O
get O
out O
of O
the O
laptop O
before O
the O
battery O
is O
drained O
far O
outweighs O
that O
bulkiness O
! O

That O
means O
that O
copying O
got O
* O
SLOW O
* O
! O

Kind O
of O
annoying O
. O

Trust O
me O
, O
you O
need O
this O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
been O
flawless O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
and O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
now O
. O

have O
a O
burn O
in O
effect O
, O
like O
the O
plasma O
TV O
. O

After O
two O
months O
of O
use O
the O
kid O
loves O
the O
combination O
when O
used O
in O
class O
to O
take O
notes O
and O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
battery O
life O
when O
the O
two O
are O
combined O
. O

For O
that O
reason O
I O
can O
not O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

but O
I O
left O
it O
at O
home O
, O
mostly O
because O
my O
books O
were O
on O
my O
touchpad O
and O
I O
did O
not O
need O
the O
laptop O
as O
much O
. O

no O
matter O
how O
good O
it O
may O
be O
in O
its O
own O
right O
, O
is O
a O
let O
down O
. O

Installation O
was O
simple O
and O
fast O
. O

We O
thought O
our O
laptop O
was O
dead O
! O

and O
I O
know O
they O
have O
it O
, O
I O
will O
not O
shop O
anyplace O
else O
. O

Working O
on O
a O
laptop O
is O
another O
story O
. O

I O
found O
the O
keyboard O
to O
be O
very O
responsive O
, O
the O
touchpad O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
I O
was O
not O
too O
thrilled O
about O
- O
no O
problems O
, O
but O
the O
surface O
kind O
of O
feels O
funny O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
like O
your O
typical O
laptop O
touchpad O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
other O
wireless O
cards O
i O
tested O
out O
provided O
better O
distance O
and O
better O
network O
sensing O
than O
this O
card O
did O
. O

however O
I O
know O
that O
I O
wo O
n't O
utilize O
it O
. O

They O
truly O
have O
no O
clue O
as O
to O
what O
counts O
in O
a O
laptop O
or O
what O
consumers O
both O
need O
and O
want O
. O

very O
responsive O
and O
works O
great O
. O

I O
am O
extremely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
and O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
. O

port.- O
A O
very O
practical O
carrying O
case O
that O
you O
can O
attach O
to O
your O
belt O
( O
i O
did O
n't O
know O
this O
and O
bought O
the O
very O
unpractical O
and O
expensive O
leather O
case O
which O
i O
wo O
n't O
use O
anyway O
) O

the O
laptop O
mate O
is O
perfect O
for O
using O
the O
computer O
to O
watch O
TV O
and O
stream O
. O

i O
've O
had O
the O
netgear O
wnr2000 O
as O
well O

The O
glossy O
screen O
would O
not O
work O
in O
my O
sunny O
family O
room O
. O

It O
is O
also O
nice O
for O
long O
trips O
in O
a O
car O
that O
does O
not O
have O
a O
speaker O
plug O
in O
for O
you O
MP3 O
player O
. O

It O
also O
can O
instantly O
fetch O
the O
weather O
, O
stock O
prices O
, O
and O
blog O
news O
entries O
( O
complete O
with O
photos O
) O
and O
display O
on O
the O
screen O
over O
what O
you O
are O
watching O
. O

It O
fits O
nicely O
( O
once O
u O
get O
used O
to O
changing O
from O
a O
little O
Microsoft O
3500 O
) O

The O
keyboard O
is O
an O
island O
style O
keyboard O
that O
are O
evenly O
spaced O
. O

I O
tried O
every O
possible O
combination O
, O
but O
the O
3 O
. O
0 O
was O
always O
the O
fastest O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
to O
get O
all O
of O
them O
into O
the O
main O
padded O
compartment O
, O
so O
the O
70 O
- O
200 O
has O
to O
be O
carried O
in O
it O
's O
own O
factory O
soft O
case O
in O
the O
pack O
's O
upper O
compartment O
. O

I O
do O
not O
use O
this O
to O
play O
blu O
- O
rays O

I O
suspect O
that O
Wacom O
is O
a O
good O
product O
even O
though O
I O
could O
not O
verify O
it O
with O
a O
functional O
one O
. O

Every O
laptop O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
or O
used O
has O
a O
power O
brick O
, O
and O
this O
case O
does O
n't O
allow O
for O
one O
. O

This O
new O
updated O
model O
though O
was O
a O
great O
find O
for O
me O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
on O
a O
part O
with O
the O
well O
- O
regarded O
Apple O
chicklet O
- O
type O
keyboard O
, O
and O
the O
display O
is O
bug O
enough O
for O
most O
tasks O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
tested O
further O
distances O
from O
other O
rooms O
/ O
locations O
in O
my O
house O
. O

The O
LinkStation O
does O
not O
do O
transcoding O
. O

I O
stayed O
connected O
with O
4 O
or O
5 O
bars O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

seems O
to O
fill O
a O
medium O
sized O
room O
. O

I O
just O
change O
my O
speaker O
system O
driver O
from O
" O
on O
PC O
speakers O
" O
to O
" O
Logitech O
Anywhere O
USB O
" O
whenever O
I O
want O
to O
listen O
on O
my O
stereo O
.... O
then O
change O
back O
again O
to O
PC O
when O
working O
at O
the O
PC3 O
. O

I O
had O
to O
pop O
open O
the O
back O
of O
the O
computer O
( O
something O
I O
'd O
assume O
most O
would O
agree O
should O
n't O
be O
necessary O
with O
a O
brand O
new O
computer O
, O
and O
something O
with O
which O
many O
would O
n't O
be O
comfortable O
) O
, O
take O
off O
the O
MASKING O
TAPE O

Love O
it O
, O
love O
it O
, O
love O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
that O
older O
model O
had O
sever O
bios O
issues O
. O

I O
can O
honestly O
say O
this O
is O
truly O
a O
one O
star O
product O
. O

Tested O
with O
a O
podcast O
file O
transfer O
from O
my O
laptop O
to O
my O
phone O
, O
worked O
great O
. O

I O
figure O
the O
computer O
had O
been O
returned O
& O
someone O
taped O
the O
cable O
& O
sold O
as O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

It O
connects O
quickly O
once O
the O
initial O
( O
very O
easy O
) O
setup O
is O
done O
, O
however O
it O
can O
only O
be O
linked O
to O
one O
device O
at O
a O
time O
, O
so O
if O
you O
switch O
back O
between O
several O
devices O
, O
you O
need O
to O
establish O
a O
new O
connection O
again O
, O
however O
this O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
do O
. O

So O
thankful O
for O
an O
affordable O
and O
good O
quality O
product O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

So O
6 O
1/4 O
x O
2 O
x O
2 O
in O
. O

The O
balance O
of O
the O
time O
has O
been O
spent O
either O
at O
the O
Repair O
Depot O
or O
enroute O
to O
or O
from O
the O
Repair O
Depot O
. O

It O
connects O
very O
quickly O
with O
the O
Kindle O
and O
stays O
connected O
. O

I O
know O
it O
shipped O
form O
HongKong O
to O
USA O
. O

Works O
great O
for O
watching O
movies O
on O
my O
laptop O
.. O

and O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
that O
other O
people O
buy O
them O
for O
safety O
reasons O
. O

The O
question O
on O
quality O
comes O
with O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
Power O
- O
On O
, O
blue O
LED O
, O
which O
died O
on O
the O
second O
day O
I O
had O
it O
. O

The O
tips O
arrive O
in O
a O
nice O
pouch O
and O
there O
's O
a O
2 O
section O
zippered O
case O
for O
the O
adapter O
and O
power O
cord O
which O
makes O
for O
easy O
organizing O
and O
travel O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
do O
unplug O
it O
so O
that O
I O
can O
use O
the O

and O
I O
can O
surely O
tell O
a O
difference O
on O
how O
hot O
my O
laptop O
gets O
when O
I O
have O
it O
unplugged O
. O

My O
testing O
involved O
a O
number O
of O
real O
- O
world O
scenarios O
that O
relied O
on O
the O
software O
tools O
I O
use O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
-- O
the O
Microsoft O

) O
, O
and O
various O
other O
programs O
that O
are O
RAM O
and O
storage O
hogs O
. O

I O
think O
the O
Netflix O
Tablet O
App O
gets O
a O
higher O
resolution O
( O
HD O
) O
stream O
from O
Netflix O
then O
the O
phone O
because O
of O
its O
larger O
screen O
size O
and O
it O
therefore O
looks O
better O
on O
the O
TV O
. O

its O
really O
compact O
, O
and O
it O
works O
nicely O
. O

The O
keyboard O
does O
not O
have O
the O
mechanical O
clicks O
that O
are O
popular O
now O
with O
gamers O
, O
but O
I O
will O
say O
they O
are O
responsive O
and O
have O
a O
good O
feel O

I O

thinking O
of O
getting O
this O
for O
my O
computer O
( O
barely O

too O
. O

No O
problem O
" O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
" O
this O
has O
backlighting O
for O
the O
keyboard O
. O
" O

Despite O
many O
negative O
responses O
from O
Mac O
users O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
memory O
for O
MacBook O

You O
have O
a O
year O
to O
buy O
it O
after O
you O
buy O
the O
computer O
, O
so O
you O
have O
the O
option O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
how O
things O
go O
. O

The O
ugly O

Nothing O

conclusion O
: O
A O
great O
value O
little O
projector O
. O

Well O
now O
with O
a O
" O
fully O
charged O
battery O
" O
and O

Very O
nice O
matte O
non O
- O
glare O
screen O
. O

so O
I O
can O
watch O
all O
the O
tv O
that O
's O
moving O
to O
the O
Internet O
. O

This O
tablet O
has O
some O
amazing O
things O
about O
it O
, O
and O
some O
flaws O
, O
but O
what O
does O
not O
have O
some O
flaws O
? O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
think O
of O
any O
good O
reason O
to O
spend O
the O
extra O
money O
for O
the O
larger O
drives O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
regretted O
that O
decision O
. O

Convenient O
and O
portable O
. O

I O
love O
the O
small O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
back O
& O
# O

; O
pouch O
, O
too O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
battery O
not O
working O
as O
promised O
but O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

and O
I O
just O
find O
that O
to O
be O
an O
unnecessary O
gimmick O
. O

so O
often O
I O
have O
a O
small O
USB O
hub O
on O
my O
desk O
with O
one O
jack O
on O
top O
and O
4 O
on O
the O
back O
and O
have O
gotten O
in O
to O
the O
routine O
of O
plugging O
my O
devices O
into O
it O
. O

Once O
orchestrated O
properly O
and O
booted O
they O
work O
flawlessly O
together O
except O
for O
the O
inability O
to O
drive O
a O
mouse O
through O
it O
. O

I O
assumed O
it O
was O
a O
fluke O
of O
my O
machine O
, O
so O

According O
to O
him O
it O
works O
great O
- O
like O
the O
original O
equipment O
. O

The O
range O
is O
wonderful O
; O
just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

These O
cloths O
are O
great O
for O
cleaning O
LCD O
displays O
, O
eye O
glasses O
and O
camera O
lenses O
. O

The O
throughput O
is O
over O
100 O
Mbps O
from O
a O
30-foot O
distance O
, O
which O
allows O
to O
transfer O
13 O

) O
, O
800 O
MB=0 O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
hidden O
sheath O
pocket O
under O
the O
front O
strap O
. O

And O
electronics O
nowadays O
are O
usually O
reliable O
and O
idiot O
- O
proof O
. O

I O
almost O
gave O
up O
and O
wanted O
to O
return O
the O
product O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
increase O
the O
range O
of O
my O
laptop O
wireless O
range O
in O
and O
around O
my O
home O
. O

I O
Did O
n't O
try O
to O
hotspot O
. O

If O
your O
like O
me O
on O
trips O
your O
rolling O
carry O
on O
never O
leaves O
your O
side O
anyways O
. O

Its O
unobtrusive O
and O
very O
light O
. O

If O
you O
still O
need O
one O
of O
these O
dinosaurs O
this O
is O
the O
one O
I O
would O
recommend O
. O

i. O
e. O
, O
provide O
more O
( O
maybe O
2 O
short O
and O
1 O
long O
) O
separators O
for O
a O
more O
flexible O
configuration O
requirement O
. O

, O
I O
got O
the O
keyboard O
every O
time O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
put O
them O
together O

It O
has O
3 O
separate O
areas O
. O

This O
will O
be O
my O
third O
battery O
for O
a O
MBP O
( O
non O
- O
unibody O
) O
purchased O
in O
mid O
2008 O
. O

, O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
change O
settings O
to O
save O
in O
JPG O
and O
RAW O
. O

It O
also O
interfaces O
very O
well O
with O
Win7 O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
compaq O
Presario O
SR5710F O
for O
under O
$ O
350 O
. O

But O
that O
also O
gives O
it O
a O
very O
sturdy O
look O
and O
feel O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
. O

Product O
works O
fine O
with O
my O
HP O
Pavilion O
dv7 O
- O
4083cl O
. O

With O
this O
new O
battery O
, O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
get O
over O
8 O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
on O
my O
Asus O
Eee O
PC O
. O

Had O
to O
get O
a O
new O
battery O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
keys O
will O
crumble O
or O
fall O
out O
but O
every O
key O
stroke O
is O
a O
reminder O
that O
it O
's O
a O
budget O
laptop O
. O

I O
especially O
do O
n't O
like O
touch O
- O
screens O
. O

Many O
people O
complained O
about O
size O
issues O
and O
fans O
being O
weak O
or O
breaking O
fast O
. O

The O
answer O
was O
: O
S O
- O
Video O
cable! O
... O
since O
my O
laptop O
had O
no O
HDMI O
port O
... O

Everything O
came O
in O
outstanding O
quality O
, O
I O
ordered O
a O
rush O
shipping O
since O
I O
was O
leaving O
town O
and O
need O
to O
replace O
the O
lens O
cap O
ASAP O
. O

No O
problems O
with O
compatibility O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
travel O
. O

Setting O
up O
a O
macbook O
is O
easy O
, O
Apple O
does O
n't O
load O
any O
bloatware O
because O
somehow O
this O
company O
manages O
to O
make O
everything O
seem O
genuine O
and O
intuitive O
for O
software O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
a O
number O
of O
different O
backpacks O
from O
Lowepro O
which O
could O
carry O
the O
camera O
equipment O
and O
the O
laptop O
and O
this O
bag O
is O
the O
best O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
. O

The O
shipping O
was O
very O
fast O
as O
well O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
how O
it O
goes O
later O
, O
but O
for O
now O
I O
am O
quite O
satisfied O
... O

A O
bit O
over O
- O
the O
- O
top O
, O
but O
gives O
me O
additional O
peace O
of O
mind O
... O
) O

and O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
Power O
Supply+Cord O
for O
HP O
Pavilion O
DV1000 O
DV6000 O
. O

Finally O
, O
this O
new O
keyboard O
restored O
my O
HP O
mini O
! O

Took O
a O
chance O
on O
these O
based O
on O
a O
review O
and O
the O
brand O
name O
. O

Received O
this O
well O
- O
priced O
, O
quality O
charger O
quickly O
and O
it O
works O
perfectly O
. O

I O
opted O
to O
get O
a O
replacement O
power O
supply O
for O
the O
unit O
after O
which O
I O
was O
able O
to O
use O
the O
enclosure O
with O
a O
WD1600JB O
160 O
GB O
drive O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

That O
way O
, O
if O
the O
C O
: O
fails O
, O
I O
have O
two O
backups O
. O

Typically O
I O
open O
up O
approx O
10 O
screens O
for O
my O
email O
, O
favorite O
sites O
, O
pandora O
streaming O
in O
background O
, O
hulu O
in O
background O
and O
one O
or O
two O
apps O
running O
such O
as O
uploading O
maps O
to O
my O
Garmin O
unit O
. O

I O
always O
look O
for O
the O
Bluerigger O
items O
because O
of O
their O
quality O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
height O
of O
the O
bag O
is O
closer O
to O
8 O
. O
5 O
" O
rather O
than O
the O
11 O
" O
listed O
on O
the O
detail O
page O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
several O
laptops O
and O
would O
be O
considered O
an O
intermediate O
to O
advanced O
computer O
user O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
get O
several O
more O
of O
these O
: O
one O
for O
work O
, O
another O
for O
personal O
lab O
. O

Luckily O
, O
I O
had O
a O
backup O
of O
all O
my O
stuff O
on O
a O
different O
external O
drive O
, O
but O
it O
was O
about O
a O
month O
old O

I O
'm O
a O
fast O
touch O
typist O
and O
the O
silver O
keyboard O
reflects O
light O
in O
low O
- O
light O
environments O
way O
better O
than O
black O
keyboards O
that O
is O
standard O
on O
most O
netbooks O
. O

There O
is O
a O
zippered O
compartment O
near O
the O
ledge O
with O
two O
pockets O
in O
it O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
put O
your O
glasses O
in O
if O
you O
want O
to O
. O

When O
I O
get O
the O
drive O
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
install O
a O
fresh O
Win7 O
( O
no O
bloatware O
) O
. O

The O
product O
arrived O
in O
adequate O
time O
and O
works O
appropriately O
. O

I O
searched O
the O
Forums O
for O
answers O
to O
my O
questions O
and O
discovered O
I O
'm O
not O
the O
only O
one O
with O
this O
problem O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
laptops O
that O
were O
17 O
inches O
in O
the O
past O
weighed O
13 O
pounds O
or O
more O
. O

I O
wanted O
more O
USB3 O
ports O
to O
run O
my O
newer O
equipment O
data O
through O
. O

Smart O
Login O
for O
extra O
measure O
of O
security- O

It O
is O
awesome O
and O
works O
well O
with O
parts O
. O

I O
connect O
this O
in O
transmit O
mode O
to O
my O
Grace O
internet O
radio O
, O
and O
send O
the O
signal O
to O
my O
Bluetooth O
receiver O
that O
is O
attached O
to O
either O
my O
home O
stereo O
or O
boombox O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
house O
. O

Slips O
out O
and O
back O
in O
easily O
and O
saves O
time O
. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
earbuds O
or O
headphones O
with O
a O
built O
in O
mic O
it O
works O
that O
way O
as O
well O
. O

I O
think O
nearly O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
basic O
backpack O
is O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
sets O
of O
stereo O
speakers O
, O
and O
so O
far O
this O
is O
the O
one O
that O
impresses O
me O
most O
. O

This O
unit O
was O
surprisingly O
fast O
when O
it O
worked O
the O
first O
few O
days O
. O

99 O
list O
) O
to O
review O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
machine O
. O

But O
, O
Teddy O
does O
need O
a O
home O
and O
would O
make O
a O
great O
gift O
. O

This O
is O
extremely O
frustrating O
and O
I O
bought O
two O
different O
products O
claiming O
to O
charge O
and O
neither O
accomplishes O
this O
. O

Its O
a O
perfect O
size O
, O
its O
not O
bulky O
and O
huge O
, O
i O
m O
really O
happy O
with O
the O
buy O
. O

Remember O
, O
even O
some O
dual O
core O
machines O
are O
9 O
times O
slower O
than O
an O
i7 O
( O
based O
on O
Passmark O
benchmarks O
) O
. O

I O
returned O
this O
mouse O
and O
bought O
a O
similarly O
sized O
mouse O
with O
a O
retractable O
cord O
, O
which O
is O
working O
out O
nicely O
. O

I O
've O
used O
it O
, O
and O
burns O
as O
well O
as O
my O
desktop O
DVD O
burner O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
even O
sure O
how O
it O
got O
there O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
it O
out O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
I O
did O
anything O
to O
cause O
the O
problem O
, O
but O
I O
was O
using O
it O
in O
my O
motorcycle O
GPS O

Also O
helpful O
for O
laptop O
battery O
owners O
( O
and O
if O
I O
used O
mine O
more O
this O
way O
, O
I O
do O
know O
they O
'd O
last O
longer O
) O
. O

Granted O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
USB O
ports O
or O
speakers O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
little O
computer O
, O
but O
I O
need O
something O
reliable O
like O
my O
last O
3 O
dells O
, O
all O
of O
which O
still O
run O
. O

Much O
faster O
. O

So O
we O
'll O
say O
4 O
stars O
-- O
good O
as O
far O
as O
netbooks O
go O
. O

and O
I O
have O
researched O
it O
and O
found O
it O
with O
other O
owners O
as O
well O
. O

I O
was O
not O
expecting O
a O
" O
boost O
" O
as O
in O
that O
s O
not O
what O
this O
product O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

I O
had O
to O
crank O
up O
the O
volume O
for O
my O
music O
player O
and O
would O
often O
forget O
to O
turn O
it O
down O
when O
I O
was O
done O
. O

I O
have O
large O
hands O
and O
this O
mouse O
completely O
disappears O
when O
I O
put O
my O
hand O
on O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
genuinely O
surprised O
there O
are O
n't O
more O
comments O
here O
about O
the O
screen O
, O
because O
it O
was O
an O
instant O
dealbreaker O
for O
me O
. O

I O
like O
to O
do O
business O
with O
Amazon O
all O
the O
time O
, O
especially O
with O
no O
shipping O
fee O
for O
item O
over O
$ O
25 O
, O
no O
body O
can O
beat O
this O
. O

And O
it O
fits O
in O
the O
bag O
for O
my O
laptop O
and O
netbook O
. O

I O
had O
to O
just O
be O
careful O
to O
remove O
the O
last O
layer O
- O
happened O
on O
2 O
out O
of O
6 O
drops O
. O

They O
are O
easy O
to O
identify O
between O
colleagues O
cables O
with O
these O
blue O
ends O
. O

Just O
not O
enough O
keys O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
one O
penny O
and O
it O
did O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
it O
to O
. O

I O
have O
always O
liked O
Logitech O
and O
consider O
this O
mouse O
to O
be O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

Previously O
she O
had O
my O
old O
one O
and O
it O
is O
about O
8 O
years O
old O
and O
had O
been O
upgraded O
to O
the O
max O
. O

Great O
product O

It O
is O
perfect O
for O
families O
who O
want O
to O
share O
videos O
. O

Why O
spend O
twice O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
, O
when O
you O
can O
get O
this O
for O
a O
very O
decent O
price O
. O

it O
's O
a O
steal O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
value O
even O
at O
the O
" O
regular O
" O
discounted O
price O
. O

They O
are O
great O
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
canceling O
out O

A O
couple O
of O

took O
me O
back O
and O
the O
right O
side O

brought O
me O
to O

I O
am O
a O
bit O
skeptical O
now O
anybody O
really O
need O
something O
formed O
into O
an O
antenna O
when O
they O
can O
use O
any O
piece O
of O
metal O
wire O
. O

I O
DID O
buy O
a O
small O
wireless O
USB O
mouse O
as O
I O
still O
do O
n't O
like O
using O
the O
tiny O
controls O
on O

Fits O
the O

perfect O
. O

Wish O
I O
had O
known O
about O
this O
hub O
before O
. O

and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
pain O
after O
my O
last O
trip O
, O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate O
around O
in O
the O
crowds O
too O
. O

Perhaps O
only O
good O
for O
car O
or O
home O
. O

Otherwise O
perfect O
buy O

and O

This O
is O
" O
covered O
" O
under O
the O
warranty O
, O
but O
you O
still O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
replacement O
/ O
repair O
shipping O
. O

I O
did O
purchase O
another O
one O
of O
these O
and O
it O
works O
fine O
. O

Obviously O
this O
product O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
cost O
NOW O
, O
but O
I O
forgot O
to O
review O
it O
those O
two O
( O
? O
) O
years O
ago O

Large O
for O
a O

( O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
needed O
to O
power O
this O
beast O
) O
, O
and O
yes O
... O
the O
infamous O
horrible O
trackpad O
. O

No O
crash O
, O
just O
complete O
battery O
failure O
. O

I O
might O
order O
another O
one O
just O
to O
have O
a O
spare O
in O
case O
the O
fans O
die O
one O
day O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
quite O
heavy O
at O
6 O
. O
9 O
pounds O
. O

I O
had O
to O
update O
the O
WiFi O
driver O
. O

First O
, O
it O
is O
lightweight O
and O
portable O
. O

Do O
n't O
know O
, O
and O
it O
's O
too O
much O
trouble O
to O
try O
out O
the O
different O
combinations O
. O

The O
Canon O
has O
an O
external O
battery O
that O
can O
be O
upgraded O
to O
an O
extended O
output O
where O
as O
the O
Samsung O
has O
a O
built O
in O
battery O
. O

These O
plug O
adapters O
are O
too O
loose O
! O

it O
's O
great O
that O
this O
will O
do O
DVD O
's O
and O
burn O
CD O
's O
, O
too O
. O

After O
reading O
another O
review O
here O
i O
was O
very O
careful O
not O
to O
flex O
the O
memory O
when O
removing O
it O
from O
the O
overly O
stiff O
packaging O
. O

There O
are O
side O
pockets O
however O
there O
are O
no O
closures O
on O
them O
, O
making O
them O
fairly O
useless O
for O
anything O
other O
then O
maybe O
a O
folded O
piece O
of O
paper O
... O

The O
lighting O
is O
beautiful O
. O

I O
know O
you O
can O
buy O
little O
wall O
chargers O

I O
'm O
going O
with O
another O
brand O
. O

Sure O
there O
is O
not O
any O
woofer O
to O
give O
the O
boom O
boom O
, O
but O
the O
clarity O
in O
the O
midrange O
is O
superb O
, O
and O
they O
deliver O
alot O
of O
volume O
for O
such O
small O
things O
. O

I O
really O
like O
how O
light O
it O
is O
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
bag O
for O
today O
's O
traveler O
who O
needs O
it O
to1 O
. O

The O
fault O
is O
almost O
certainly O
Samsung O
's O
, O
but O
be O
careful O
what O
you O
connect O
, O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
run O
a O

I O
've O
had O
my O
Eee O
PC O
900HA O
for O
over O
four O
years O
now O
, O
and O
I O
still O
use O
it O
actively O
for O
the O
less O
demanding O
tasks O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
connect O
my O
wired O
Xbox O
Controller O
to O
my O
Android O
device O
by O
just O
plugging O
it O
in O

Non O

is O
avialable O
if O
you O
have O
a O
QAM O

. O

Anyone O
that O
has O
seen O

Center O
will O
recognize O
the O
look O
and O
feel O

Hard O
for O
me O
to O
imagine O
8 O
gig O
is O
a O
tiny O
package O
and O
it O
works O
beautifully O
. O

Much O
richer O
sound O
, O
with O
decent O
bass O
for O
what O
they O
are O
. O

It O
's O
very O
simple O
to O
pair O
with O
iPhones O
and O
iPods O
, O
although O
since O
it O
always O
looks O
for O
the O
last O
connected O
device O
, O
if O
you O
share O
this O
speaker O
with O
others O
, O
you O
may O
have O
to O
visit O
your O
bluetooth O
settings O
in O
the O
menu O
to O
manually O
connect O
to O
it O
. O

When O
it O
finally O
came O
time O
to O
buy O
ourselves O
an O

he O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
research O
, O
being O
more O
technologically O
inclined O
than O
I O
am O
. O

I O
was O
very O
frustrated O
at O
first O
having O
to O
learn O
Windows O
8 O
. O

If O
it O
lasts O
at O
least O
2 O
years O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
with O
that O
. O

I O
get O
that O
there O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
tablets O
competing O
with O
this O
machine O
, O
but O
there O
's O
just O
something O
about O
having O
a O
real O
keyboard O
and O
a O
touchscreen O
that O
makes O
for O
a O
very O
compelling O
experience O
. O

Purchasing O
one O
of O
these O
drives O

In O
summary O
, O
I O
would O
use O
the O
Lowepro O
ProRunner O
450 O
AW O
to O
carry O
all O
my O
photographic O
equipment O
in O
one O
bag O
as O
carry O
on O
luggage O
on O
an O
airplane O
or O
in O
a O
car O
. O

My O
old O
cable O
works O
better O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
mouse O
and O
found O
that O
it O
was O
a O
comfortable O
, O
small O
but O
easy O
to O
use O
mouse O
. O

& O
I O
could O
n't O
even O
tell O
if O
it O
worked O
or O
not O
, O
since O
i O
'd O
never O
even O
seen O
it O
on O
. O

Well O
I O
've O
been O
pretty O
rough O
with O
the O
wiring O

it O
's O
important O
to O
note O
that O
not O
all O
Macs O
support O
audio O
via O
HDMI O
( O
clearly O
marked O
on O
the O
box O
) O

" O
I O
needed O
to O
do O
major O
upgrade O
of O

and O
was O
up O
and O
working O
again O
. O

Amazon O

this O

an O
easy O
recommend O

if O
you O
can O

Ultimately O
, O
between O
the O

the O
inconvenience O
of O
having O
to O
reconnect O
it O

the O

for O
itself O

this O
is O
just O
as O
good O
or O
better O
than O
the O
original O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
looks O
incongruent O
with O
my O
rugged O

Well O
I O
have O
to O
say O
, O
I O
should O
have O
updated O

The O
dark O

was O
so O
thin O
where O
it O
met O
the O
body O
of O
the O

that O
it O
broke O
immediately O

I O
am O
not O

out O

you O
can O
fold O
up O

easier O

ExperienceI O
find O
that O
I O
love O
the O

and O
I O
tend O
to O
use O
it O
more O
than O
my O
two O
regular O

which O
I O
would O
be O
reluctant O
to O
take O
anywhere O
when O
I O
have O
this O

UPDATE O
05/28/2011 O
: O
: O
: O
So O
I O
ended O
up O
doing O
a O
clean O
install O
of O
Windows O
7 O
Pro O
because O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
boxee O
or O
xbmc O
to O
install O
and O
was O
sick O
of O
the O
occasional O
performance O
lags O
. O

The O
audio O
quality O
, O
as O
obvious O
to O
any O
other O
DSLR O
is O
not O
even O
usable O
, O
so O
use O
a O
RODE O
VideoMic O
or O
TACSAM O
recorder O
to O
gather O
your O
audioThe O
buk O
, O
d O
quality O
is O
NICE O
, O
the O
bottwm O
door O
for O
the O
battery O
and O
SD O
Card O
is O
badly O
engineered O
as O
you O
are O
forced O
to O
manually O
push O
back O
the O
pin O
to O
keep O
the O
door O
locked O
. O

I O
tried O
other O
laptop O
bags O
, O
some O
much O
more O
expensive O
. O

I O
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
content O
creation O
( O
Audio O
, O
video O
, O
photo O
editing O
) O
and O
its O
reliable O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
shoulder O
bag O
to O
use O
for O
my O
70 O
- O
200 O
attached O

I O
broke O
down O
and O
purchased O
this O
speaker O
that O
attaches O
directly O
to O
the O
Dell O
monitor O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
possible O
on O
a O
mobile O
device O
. O

It O
is O
great O
for O
power O
cords O
and O
whatnot O
. O

and O
then O
they O
put O
a O
32bit O
operating O
system O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

And O
GOOD O
LUCK O
finding O
how O
to O
get O
TO O
the O
assistance O
. O

Whether O
you O
're O
listening O
to O
music O
or O
watching O
a O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
movie O
, O
the O
enhanced O
audio O
capability O
is O
a O
nice O
addition O
. O

All O
slanting O
has O
done O
for O
me O
is O
give O
me O
carpal O
tunnel O
. O

The O
laptop O
backpack O
design O
was O
great O
and O
made O
storing O
my O
things O
in O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
manage O
. O

I O
've O
found O
that O
it O
definitely O
keeps O
from O
being O
as O
productive O
as O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
on O
it O
. O

No O
more O
Dell O
products O
for O
me O
! O

It O
still O
works O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
phenomenal O
-- O
far O
more O
than O
stated O
. O

If O
something O
it O
extra O
special O
or O
dang O
annoying O
I O
will O
let O
you O
know O

I O
know O
it O
says O
& O
# O
34;thin&#34 O
; O
but O
c'mon!-The O
trackpad O
is O
as O
bad O
as O
everyone O
says O
. O

I O
say O
& O
# O
34;apparent&#34 O
; O
because O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
get O
a O
definitive O
answer O
from O
HP O
as O
to O
whether O
swapping O
cards O
is O
possible O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
unit O
and O
with O
the O
seller O
. O

The O
E7 O
will O
still O
charge O
in O
the O
cradle O
, O
but O
the O
USB O
ca O
n't O
get O
a O
lock O
unless O
you O
jiggle O
the O
E7 O
around O
in O
its O
cradle O
for O
awhile O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
insides O
are O
Acer O
parts O
, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
outside O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
then O
there O
's O
the O
E5c O
at O
$ O
500 O
, O
but O
I O
could O
not O
bring O
myself O
to O
pay O
more O
than O
I O
did O
for O
my O
iPod O
, O
especially O
since O
I O
recently O
bought O
Altec O
Lansing O
's O
outstandin O
inMotion O
speakers O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
use O
the O
radio O
is O
to O
have O
some O
kind O
of O
cable O
plugged O
in O
to O
act O
as O
an O
antenna O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
perfectly O
fit O
like O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
laptop O
, O
but O
it O
stays O
in O
and O
it O
's O
barely O
noticeable O
( O
by O
barely O
noticeable O

But O
in O
the O
bag O
, O
the O
elastic O
strips O
shift O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
parts O
still O
end O
up O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

BUT O
.. O
2 O
) O
it O
does O
n't O
last O
long O
. O

As O
far O
as O
waterproofing O
, O
the O
flap O
on O
top O
only O
uses O
velcro O
to O
cover O
it O
, O
not O
a O
zipper O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
to O
check O
it O
out O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
easy O
to O
pop O
the O
earbuds O
on O
and O
off O
to O
switch O
or O
to O
clean O
them O
. O

It O
's O
got O
minimal O
internal O
storage O
. O

With O
my O
notebook O
and O
this O
case O
I O
can O
see O
no O
reason O
to O
buy O
a O
tablet O
and O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
$ O
. O

I O
was O
very O
pleased O
until O
it O
failed O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
fine O
. O

You O
can O
use O
the O
USB O
connection O
with O
any O
tablet O
or O
phone O
, O
though O
you O
will O
need O
to O
provide O
the O
right O
cable O
. O

HOWEVER O
, O
the O
color O
they O
call O
" O
tannin O
" O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
deep O
purple O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
Acer O
was O
really O
excellent O
in O
handling O
the O
bigger O
problem O
( O
a O
noisy O
fan O
) O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
report O
to O
them O
until O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
one O
year O
warranty O
. O

Then O
took O
one O
of O
my O
other O
tablets O
and O
plugged O
it O
into O
this O
case O
/ O
keyboard O
and O
it O
worked O
fine O
! O

Like O
other O
reviews O
said O
, O
it O
elevates O
the O
back O
of O
the O
laptop O
a O
bit O
, O
a O
good O
bonus O
because O
the O
keyboard O
angle O
is O
better O
now O
. O

Again O
, O
2 O
repairs O
in O
less O
than O
a O
year O
? O

Tried O
Logitech O
and O
Motorola O
, O
not O
as O
good O
and O
larger O
footprint O
. O

The O
materials O
are O
good O
quality O
as O
well O
as O
the O
sewing O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
the O
2 O

- O
but O
for O
demonstration O
purposes O
it O
proved O
adequate O
. O

If O
you O
think O
you O
're O
being O
smart O
and O
saving O
some O
money O
by O
getting O
anything O
to O
the O
left O
of O
the O
C920 O
on O
the O
chart O
, O
you O
're O
in O
for O
a O
surprise O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
anyone O
who O
wishes O
a O
strong O
dual O
band O
connection O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
am O
always O
concerned O
about O
support O
, O
so O
I O
called O
Diamond O
before O
I O
bought O
the O
TV O
tuner O

But O
it O
fits O
in O
the O
palm O
of O
my O
hand O
, O
easily O
in O
a O
pocket O
, O
and O
expand O
out O
to O
something O
that O
fills O
the O
room O
with O
clear O
, O
crisp O
sound O
with O
adequate O
bass O
and O
enough O
fidelity O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
tire O
of O
listening O
to O
it O
. O

Overpriced O
, O
given O
all O
the O
features O
( O
or O
lack O
thereof O
) O
and O
" O
cheap O
" O
material O
used O
- O
Side O
pockets O
barely O
accommodate O
my O
water O

I O
Highly O
recommend O
this O
! O

The O
display O
presented O
on O
the O
laptop O
screen O
is O
very O
readable O
. O

My O
neighbor O
walked O
in O
today O
and O
noticed O
the O
little O
speaker O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
radio O
. O

I O
have O
not O
tested O
extensively O

To O
the O
point O
to O
where O
if O
you O
take O
it O
out O
and O
hold O
it O
in O
your O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
very O
uncomfortable O
to O
touch O
. O

The O
proce O
/ O
performance O
ratio O
is O
very O
good O
. O

They O
hold O
a O
decent O
charge O
but O
the O
main O
issue O
I O
have O
is O
that O
you O
can O
only O
separate O
them O
by O
2 O
feet O
do O
to O
wiring O
. O

It O
's O
a O
simple O
product O
that O
does O
what O
it O
says O
it O
will O
do O
. O

Will O
never O
buy O
another O
HP O
product O
of O
any O
kind O
again O
..... O
the O
first O
customer O
service O
person O
I O
spoke O
with O
was O
unsympathetic O
and O
nearly O
rude O
. O

However O
, O
the O
downside O
to O
it O
is O
it O
turn O
off O
the O
charging O
itself O
once O
the O
phone O
reach O
to O
100 O
% O
. O

Its O
a O
charger O
how O
wonderful O
could O
it O
be O
? O

This O
adapter O
worked O
perfectly O
! O

Very O
nice O
, O
sleek O
packaging O
. O

Still O
, O
anything O
is O
better O
than O
carrying O
a O
tripod O
on O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
or O
in O
one O
hand O
when O
climbing O
a O
mountain O
to O
get O
a O
great O
shot O
overlooking O
the O
Valley O
Of O
The O
Sun O
or O
Sonoran O
Desert O
, O
and O
I O
imagine O
not O
falling O
over O
due O
to O
imbalance O
will O
pay O
off O
. O

Being O
an O
ASUS O
product O
and O
having O
used O
ASUS O
motherboards O
in O
desktop O
computers O

This O
service O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
cost O
. O

com O
for O
my O
Acer O
Aspire O
3680 O
. O

The O
pockets O
are O
abundant O
, O
although O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
4 O
stars O
instead O
of O
5 O
is O
because O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
some O
larger O
, O
more O
accessible O
pockets O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
still O
can O
not O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
get O
out O
of O
different O
screens O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
charger O

This O
paradox O
makes O
owning O
an O
E5 O
rather O
pointless O
for O
most O
DAP O
and O
PMP O
owners O
, O
unless O
of O
course O
they O
happen O
to O
be O
running O
around O
with O
a O
fairly O
inefficient O
headphone O
set O
. O

I O
discovered O
that O
Google O
Earth O
has O
continued O
to O
improve O
over O
the O
years O
, O
and O
now O
it O
has O
a O
fly O
low O
option O
that O
I O
find O
compelling O
. O

These O
helped O
me O
connect O
my O
2 O
front O
panel O

but O
I O
run O
a O
cooling O
fan O
under O
my O
laptop O
so O
may O
use O
up O
more O
battery O
. O

The O
touchpad O
would O
not O
scroll O
because O
the O
driver O
was O
not O
installed O
. O

The O
" O
power O
cord O
that O
plugs O
into O

from O

, O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
anything O
else O
( O
if O
you O
already O
have O
the O

installed O
) O
. O

One O
downside O
it O
does O
have O
an O
appetite O
for O
ink O
, O
although O
not O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
. O

Once O
you O
install O
this O
in O
your O
camera O
or O
device O
, O
you O
will O
generally O
want O
to O
format O
the O
card O
with O
your O
compatible O
device O
's O
interface O
. O

Works O
flawlessly O
with O
my O
iPhone O
, O

, O
camera O
and O
all O
, O
nice O
little O
package O
for O
the O
desktop O
, O
minus O
one O
star O
for O
the O
useless O
blue O
light O
which O
glows O
24/7 O
. O

There O
are O
over O
300 O
reviews O
for O
that O
already O
. O

This O
newest O
generation O
of O
SSD+HDD O
from O
Seagate O
uses O
cheaper O
MLC O
instead O
of O
the O
more O
expensive O
( O
and O
more O
durable O
) O
SLC O
, O
and O
they O
did O
n't O
increase O
the O
size O
of O
the O
SSD O
portion O
. O

If O
you O
do O
travel O
, O
get O
this O
and O
you O
will O
see O
how O
great O
this O
is O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
not O
only O
for O
its O
useful O
features O
but O
for O
Jabra O
's O
excellent O
customer O
service O
. O

You O
can O
see O
how O
it O
makes O
the O
boot O
screen O
( O
ASUS O

) O
and O
the O
Windows O
boot O
screen O
look O
somewhat O
washed O
out O
before O
you O
even O
get O
into O
the O

I O
like O
it O
so O
much O
I O
bought O
another O
for O
my O

Bad O

although O
it O
looks O
really O
nice O
, O
it O
has O
one O
flaw O
that O
would O
irk O
some O
users O
. O

The O

The O

if O
I O

Pros- O
PRICE!- O
Excellent O

It O
's O
a O
battery O
and O
it O
does O
what O
it O
's O
suppose O
to O
do O
. O

It O
has O
a O
gorgeous O
picture O
and O
plays O
digital O
videos O
like O
a O
charm O
, O
with O

There O
's O
only O
three O
personal O
dislikes O

PLUS O
, O
this O
comes O
with O
a O
small O
docking O
station O
so O
, O
if O
you O
have O
to O
, O
you O
can O
position O
the O
LAN O
adapter O
( O
your O
wireless O
antenna O
really O
) O
for O
optimum O
reception O
. O

The O
video O
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
noise O
cancellation O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

What O
I O
dislike O
is O
that O
it O
is O
very O
wide O
at O
the O
sides O
, O
this O
makes O
it O
a O
little O
uncomfortable O
feeling O
the O
weight O
load O
to O
go O
to O
the O
sides O
. O

Why O
call O
it O
a O
2 O
Pack O
when O
you O
can O
only O
use O
it O
on O
one O
machine O
? O

I O
hated O
the O
old O
one O

much O

When O

the O

asked O
me O
to O
assign O
an O
IP O

to O
the O
print O
server O
, O
and O
started O
me O
out O
with O
all O

Most O
notebook O
and O
laptop O
computers O
have O
vents O
on O
the O
bottom O
where O
the O
computer O
's O
internal O
fans O
pull O
air O
into O
the O
unit O
and O
discharge O
it O
out O
of O
side O
or O
rear O
vents O
. O

As O
someone O
who O
always O
commutes O
with O
my O
laptop O
it O
is O
really O
annoying O
to O
have O
to O
pack O
not O
only O
the O
charging O
brick O
but O
ALSO O
a O
huge O
annoying O
cord O
as O
well O
. O

that O

The O

is O
almost O
as O
big O
as O
the O
ones O
on O
my O
regular O
laptops O

does O
n't O
fit O
in O
the O

its O
got O
built O
in O

card O
so O
u O
can O
not O
take O
it O
out O
and O
put O
another O
one O
in O

I O
noticed O
that O
compatibility O
is O
limited O
to O
Windows O
7 O
( O
32 O
bit O
only O
) O
but O
I O
am O
using O
it O
on O

and O
have O
encountered O
no O
problems O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
little O
computer O
feels O
so O
solid O
and O
well O
built O
. O

My O
Pandora O

never O
sounded O
so O
good O
. O

From O
here O
, O
you O
can O
close O
it O
, O
or O
boot O
Windows O
7 O
. O

These O
I O
have O
are O
pretty O
standard O
but O
the O
printer O
does O
n't O
like O
them O
. O

The O
caps O
are O
of O
the O
center O
pinch O
design O
which O
I O
prefer O
as O
, O
it O
comes O
off O
much O
easier O
than O
the O
original O
outer O
grasp O
one O
. O

This O
backpack O
was O
bought O
because O
it O
holds O
my O
dv-7 O
17 O
inch O
widescreen O
laptop O
perfectly O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
only O
backpack O
i O
could O
find O
that O
actually O
said O
it O
would O
fit O
my O
oversized O
laptop O
. O

We O
will O
be O
able O
to O
continue O
using O
the O
box O
to O
store O
the O
cable O
when O
not O
in O
use O
. O

I O
was O
willing O
to O
sacrifice O
some O
bass O
to O
ditch O
my O
bulky O
subwoofer O
, O
which O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
the O
silver O

in O
the O

How O
in O

can O
you O
one O
give O
an O
article O

and O
then O
wish O
NOT O
to O
use O
it O
. O

My O
only O
suggestion O
would O
be O
a O
better O
way O
to O
wake O
it O
back O
up O
after O
it O
goes O
to O
sleep O

Keeps O
the O
case O
from O
being O
scratched O

you O
have O
another O
way O
to O
attach O
to O

I O
was O
also O
hoping O
to O
be O
able O
to O
travel O
easily O
with O
this O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
would O
probably O
have O
to O
go O
in O
the O
suitcase O
rather O
than O
the O
carry O

on O

because O
of O
it O
's O
awkward O

shape O

might O
also O
consider O

if O
they O

This O
battery O
lasts O
approximately O
4 O
hours O
from O
a O
full O
charge O
, O
and O
seems O
to O
act O
perfectly O
as O
a O
direct O
replacement O
in O
my O
T61 O
. O

This O
means O
that O
it O
requires O
TWO O
USB O
ports O
on O
your O
computer O
or O
laptop O
to O
power O
this O
thing O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
have O
no O
receptacle O
where O
we O
want O
the O
radio O
positioned O
. O

It O
's O
a O
very O
good O
machine O
but O
just O
not O
as O
nice O
as O
a O
macbook O
pro O
( O
which O
is O
deserving O
of O
5 O
stars O
, O
IMO O
) O
. O

My O
mother O
in O

was O
getting O
a O
message O
upon O

that O
the O

was O

. O

I O
just O
stopped O
working O
. O

If O
the O
screws O
are O
in O
too O
tight O
then O
you O
may O
have O
to O
get O
another O
screwdriver O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
since O
it O
will O
provide O
better O
torque O
. O

It O
is O
different O
than O
the O
one O
pictured O
, O
in O
that O
it O
is O
made O
of O
metal O
and O
so O
does O
n't O
have O
or O
need O
reinforcing O
embossed O
areas O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Dell O
Latitude O
D630 O
that O
gets O
extremely O
warm O
. O

A O
computer O
is O
a O
computer O
, O
and O
if O
you O
abuse O
it O
, O
it O
will O
break O
. O

Do O
i O
wish O
i O
would O
have O
known O
that O
before O
buying O
..... O

One O
has O
to O
wonder O
why O
only O
$ O
50 O
for O
such O
exceptional O
speakers O
. O

I O
got O
but O
not O
for O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

But O
the O
headphones O
are O
not O
of O
best O
quality O
. O

They O
both O
work O
fine O
, O
but O
a O
common O
complaint O
here O
- O
that O
the O
plug O
& O
# O
34;slips O
out&#34 O
; O
of O
your O
laptop O
is O
a O
concern O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
it O
only O
connects O
to O
WEP O
networks O
on O
my O
Ubuntu O
System O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
because O
it O
is O
made O
of O
plastic O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
as O
sturdy O
as O
you O
would O
like O
a O
keyboard O
to O
be O
. O

but O
I O
just O
could O
not O
justify O
the O
price O
. O

That O
does O
n't O
really O
give O
you O
gigabit O
speeds O
though O
, O
as O
in O
THEORY O
you O
could O
get O
up O
to O
125 O

there O
is O

for O

that O
can O
hold O
17 O

so O
it O
's O
a O
decent O
choice O
, O
but O
way O
too O
expensive O
. O

I O
have O
purchased O
many O
cables O
from O
MediaBridge O
and O
I O
have O
never O
been O

As O
I O
mentioned O
it O
compliments O

and O
also O
allows O
me O
to O
work O
with O
the O

Again O
, O
I O
would O
have O
been O
willing O
to O
overlook O
the O
cosmetic O
differences O
if O
I O
had O
succeeded O
in O
playing O
music O
arranged O
in O
folders O
, O
but O
with O
this O
limitation O
the O
device O
was O
useless O
to O
me O
and O
I O
retuned O
it O
for O
a O
refund O
. O

I O
had O
a O
heck O
of O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
my O
girlfriend O
a O

that O
she O
liked O
for O
her O

I O
am O
knocking O
this O

I O
think O

done O
a O

a O

did O
not O
respond O
to O
my O

either O
. O

I O
had O
to O
return O
this O
to O
Amazon O
because O
of O
what O
I O
consider O
a O
fatal O
flaw O
in O
the O
keyboard O
design O
. O

About O
a O
week O
ago O
I O
bought O
the O
Etekcity O

This O
did O

look O
anything O

I O
had O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O

My O
first O
set O
was O
defective O
and O
the O
backlight O
flickered O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
exchange O
it O
. O

( O
I O
've O
read O

so O

The O

is O
already O
sturdy O
enough O

and O
what O
I O
looked O
for O
was O
a O
thin O
and O
light O
cover O
to O
avoid O
scratches O
and O
stains O
when O
placed O
on O

I O
really O
like O

because O
it O

not O

I O
'll O
get O

as O
I O
need O
it O
. O

I O
was O
planning O
to O
buy O
a O
much O
more O
expensive O
set O
of O
these O
, O
but O
just O
could O
n't O
afford O
it O
. O

First O
time O
I O
hooked O
it O
up O

I O
like O
the O
way O
it O
hangs O
vertically O
, O
sort O
of O
like O
a O
purse O
. O

This O
case O
is O
great O
. O

But O
for O
the O
occasional O
game O
, O
the O
occasional O
video O
edit O
, O
you O
'll O
score O
well O
here O
. O

I O
wasted O
time O
trying O
to O
save O
a O
few O
bucks O
with O
aftermarket O
ones O
and O
they O
all O
stunk O
. O

( O
I O
save O
mine O
up O
over O
a O
year O
or O
two O
in O
a O
box O
in O
the O

along O
with O

, O
and O
other O
toxic O
or O
electronic O
stuff O
and O
drop O
it O
all O
off O
at O
the O
local O
transfer O
station O
in O
spring O
time O
. O
) O

EXTREMELY O
overpriced O
. O

This O
is O
no O
substitute O
for O
a O
full O
- O
size O
keyboard O
for O
writing O
your O
novel O
- O
but O
it O
's O
working O
well O
for O
smartphone O
input O
at O
the O
desk O
... O
small O
footprint O
, O
long O
lasting O
charge O
, O
easy O
bluetooth O
connect O
. O

When O
connected O
to O
an O
external O
monitor O
, O
you O
can O
mirror O
or O
extend O
the O
desktop O
. O

I O
suspect O
a O
faulty O
USB O
wire O
inside O
the O
device O
as O
it O
may O
not O
have O
proper O
strain O
relief O
inside O
to O
accommodate O
the O
overly O
tight O
wire O
tension O
and O
it O
pulls O
too O
tight O
when O
removing O
it O
from O
the O
storage O
slot O
around O
the O
device O
. O

When O
I O
send O
sound O
to O
a O
camera O
, O
there O
is O
a O
headphone O
jack O
that O
allows O
me O
to O
hear O
what O
the O
camera O
hears O
, O
so O
I O
can O
verify O
that O
the O
sound O
is O
getting O
on O
the O
tape O
. O

and O
it O
's O
portable O
enough O
that O
I O
can O
BE O
portable O
with O
it O
. O

So O
it O
is O
somewhat O
directional O
. O

Well O
- O
made O
, O
fits O
nicely O
around O
the O

But O
if O
you O
enjoy O
a O
variety O
of O
music O
and O
like O
the O
presence O
of O
bass O
, O
these O
may O
be O
just O
the O
perfect O
speakers O
you O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
. O

This O
computer O
comes O
with O
Windows O

64-bit O
with O
2 O

to O
handle O
it O
nicely O
. O

I O
have O
a O
17 O
" O
HP O
Entertainment O
Laptop O
. O

It O
's O
worth O
a O
few O
seconds O
to O
double O
check O
it O
. O

I O
have O
another O
one O
just O
like O
it O
and O
after O
what O
happened O
today O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
back O
the O
" O
good O

one O
up O
right O
now O
before O
it O
fails O
too O
. O

Life O
is O
too O
short O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
stinking O
battery O
, O
so O
I O
was O
shocked O
, O
finding O
out O
the O
battery O
was O
toast O
after O
using O
the O
laptop O
twice O
. O

I O
am O
now O
hearing O
details O
that O
only O
could O
be O
heard O
on O
very O
expensive O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
players O
! O
! O
! O

Other O
features O
include O
an O
adjustable O
tripod O
holder O
, O
which O
I O
suppose O
could O
just O
as O
well O
be O
used O
as O
a O
light O
stand O

. O

the O
MARLEY O
LIVELY O

is O
perfect O

. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
teenage O
son O
and O
he O
likes O
it O
to O
take O
into O
a O
room O
to O
play O
outloud O
. O

So O
the O
only O
indication O
that O
your O
device O
is O
charging O
is O
the O
device O
itself O
which O
may O
beep O
or O
have O
some O
visual O
indicator O
. O

It O
said O
' O
unavailable O
' O
but O
paired O
with O
devices O
. O

but O
ok O
I O
guess O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
are O
getting O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
. O

But O
I O
was O
amazed O
by O
just O
how O
big O

This O

empty O

before O
it O
- O
without O
warning O

shut O
down O
. O

Also O
, O
the O

button O
has O
an O
indicator O
light O
in O
it O
, O
which O
we O
can O
not O
see O
after O
putting O
on O
this O
cover O
. O

In O
my O
experience O
, O
the O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
cards O
are O
more O
stable O
than O
the O
USB O
ones O
. O

No O
special O

are O
needed O

and O
i O
refuse O
to O
buy O

I O
give O

As O
far O
as O
Mac O
OS O
X O
vs. O
Windows O
7 O
, O
let O
me O
be O
the O
first O
to O
say O
that O
Windows O
7 O
is O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
, O
although O
better O
than O
Vista O
was O
. O

I O
was O
hoping O
to O
stream O
videos O
from O
my O
computer O
to O
my O
phone O
, O
then O
cast O
it O
to O
the O
TV O
. O

It O
came O
as O
described O
and O
replaced O
a O
bad O
part O
and O
it O
works O
. O

A O
tad O
thicker O
than O
a O
skin O
almost O
. O

a O
good O
idea O
is O
a O
question O
I O
am O
still O
pondering O
. O

Zbook O
has O
much O
thinner O
expansion O
slot O
and O
a O
different O
alignment O
for O
the O
internal O
retaining O
screw O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
keys O
are O
in O
different O
places O
than O
what O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
, O
and O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
type O
using O
the O
" O
home O
row O
" O
keys O
if O
that O
's O
what O
you O
're O
used O
to O
. O

If O
you O
have O
it O
on O
your O
lap O
for O
web O
browsing O
or O
movies O
, O
you O
will O
just O
barely O
be O
able O
to O
perceive O
it O
's O
warmth O
. O

The O
blue O
color O
is O
more O
of O
a O
teal O
( O
according O
to O
my O
wife O
) O
but O
kind O
of O
grew O
on O
me O
after O
awhile O
. O

I O
use O
the O
PC O
card O
at O
both O
home O
and O
work O
and O
it O
picks O
the O
signal O
with O
no O
trouble O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
have O
my O
keyboard O
set O
to O
stay O
on O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
naturally O
, O
it O
turns O
off O
automatically O
when O
the O
computer O
is O
shut O
down O
. O

I O
tried O
restoring O
again O
- O
four O
times O
. O

I O
have O
hooked O
this O
up O
to O
two O
massage O
devices O
at O
once O
overseas O
and O
it O
worked O
well O
. O

The O
link O
is O
on O
the O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
see O
an O
easy O
way O
to O
use O
this O
in O
portrait O
mode O
, O
which O
would O
be O
nice O
for O

Flimsier O

I O
expected O

I O
would O
still O

I O
have O
been O
enjoying O
this O
laptop O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

Purchased O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
's O
laptop O
and O
it O
worked O
well O
. O

I O
used O
this O
product O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
India O
and O
found O
it O
to O
be O
well O
designed O
and O
built O
. O

They O
do O
make O
great O
computer O
speakers O
and O
mp3 O
speakers O
as O
well O
. O

The O
track O
pad O
is O
sensitive O
and O
responsive O
; O
no O
lag O
time O
at O
all O
. O

It O
boots O

but O
on O

it O
is O

because O
they O
are O

Amazon O

I O
feel O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
other O
cases O
because O
I O
own O
several O

along O
with O
a O
very O
wide O
variety O
of O
cases O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O

has O
become O
less O
about O

just O
take O
my O
word O
for O

. O

So O
I O
let O
this O
Bluetooth O

run O
and O
it O
played O
for O
eight O
hours O
and O
ten O
minutes O
before O
it O
needed O
a O

When O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
let O
it O
charge O
for O
a O
full O
24 O
hours O
, O
then O
unplugged O
the O
cord O
and O
ran O
it O
until O
it O
shut O
itself O
down O

In O

it O

crappy O

with O
the O
low O

does O
not O
leave O

love O
it O
I O
would O
defiantly O
buy O
again O

I O
previously O

that O

For O
a O

this O
small O
, O
that O
is O
tremendous O
. O

They O
work O
great O
, O
though O
the O
design O
does O
n't O
really O
cater O
to O
cable O
organization O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
a O
student O
computer O
, O
a O
travel O
computer O
, O
or O
just O
a O
small O
, O
reasonably O
priced O
all O
- O
around O

You O
can O
add O
4 O

Looks O
like O
I O
will O
need O
to O
be O
returning O
them O
. O

I O
have O
noticed O
that O
all O
of O
the O
local O
stores O
have O
it O
now O
as O
a O
promo O
with O
these O
fetures O
and O
they O
fluxuate O
each O
week O
in O
price O
from O
$ O
599 O
down O
to O
$ O
499 O
depending O
on O
the O
store O
ad O
's O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
out O
the O
Windows O
Ready O
- O
Boost O
feature O
with O
this O
SD O
card O
, O
but O
since O
most O
of O
the O
things O
I O
do O
are O
not O
memory O
intensive O
( O
surfing O
the O
web O
, O
remote O
desktop O
, O
VNC O
) O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
fairly O
small O
memory O
card O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
. O

This O
keeps O
the O
other O
input O
from O
switching O
. O

No O
more O
looking O
for O
those O
little O
adapter O
cards O
anymore O
either O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
it O
's O
not O
a O
" O
defect O
" O
but O
simply O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
beast O
. O

Have O
been O
using O
this O
machine O
for O
several O
months O
now O
with O
no O
complaint O
. O

GoGroove O
support O
through O
amazon O
is O
simply O
fantastic O
. O

The O
power O
plug O
is O
EXTREMELY O
small O
and O
tight O
- O
fitting O
. O

Pairing O
of O
the O
speaker O
to O
my O
tablet O
was O
easy O
. O

This O
really O
is O
a O
good O
tablet O
and O
I O
can O
recommend O
it O
to O
people O
who O
want O
to O
completely O
get O
rid O
of O
mice O
and O
other O
pointing O
devices O
. O

had O
to O
keep O
moving O
it O
around O
just O
to O
get O
laptop O
to O
charge O
. O

Great O
for O
small O
room O
or O
office O
and O
for O
public O
places O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
intrude O
on O
neighbors O
50 O
feet O
away O
. O

; O
parallel O
( O
PATA O
or O
IDE O
) O
interface O
arrangement O
. O

This O
protector O
is O
a O
gem O
, O
I O
love O
it O
. O

it O
met O
all O
my O
expectations O
for O
about O
4 O
days O
( O
4 O
. O
5 O
stars O
for O
a O
few O
days O
) O
. O

As O
I O
applied O
it O
, O
you O
basically O
fill O
as O
much O
as O
is O
useful O
, O
whilst O
still O
having O
the O
mouse O
in O
your O
" O
Dominant O
" O
hand O
( O
assuming O
you O
are O
either O
left O
or O
right O
handed O
; O
this O
of O
course O
is O
a O
redundant O
statement O
if O
you O
are O
ambidextrous O
) O
, O
and O
the O
G13 O
can O
be O
used O
in O
place O
of O
your O
mouse O
for O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
game O
, O
and O
the O
mouse O
can O
swap O
easily O
if O
it O
is O
wireless O
. O

So O
when O
I O
saw O
this O
bag O
, O
I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
! O

If O
you O
carry O
more O
than O
one O
device O
and O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
you O
can O
charge O
up O
when O
travelling O
, O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
. O

Keyboard O
keys O
are O
well O
spaced O
out O
and O
backlit O
is O
a O
good O
addition O
. O

It O
drove O
me O
nuts O
for O
a O
bit O
when O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
the O
Boombox O
( O
it O
shows O
& O
# O
34;headset&#34 O
; O
) O
in O
the O
& O
# O
34;playback&#34 O
; O
window O
, O
but O
could O
in O
the O
& O
# O
34;record&#34 O
; O
window O
( O
and O
it O
showed O
in O
control O
panel O
under O
devices O
and O
it O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
connected O
. O
) O

but O
the O
zipper O
will O
close O
over O
the O
laptop O
without O
forcing O
it O
. O

I O
really O
went O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
an O
item O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
, O
but O
something O
that O
I O
really O
do O
nt O

The O
quality O
is O
very O
good O
, O
and O
it O
's O
very O
well O
built O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
're O
in O
college O
. O

This O
product O
is O
worth O
more O
than O
i O
paid O
for O
. O
very O
happy O
. O

Two O
days O
later O
I O
was O
pleased O
to O
open O
the O
box O
and O
see O
that O
the O
main O
unit O
is O
virtually O
identical O
to O
the O
OEM O
original O
, O
and O
the O
cords O
are O
actually O
better O
construction O
than O
the O
OEM O
version O
-- O
heavier O
insulation O
, O
excellent O
cord O
- O
strain O
- O
relief O
design O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
machine O
I O
bought O
in O
2011 O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
using O
both O
the O
hard O
disk O
and O
the O
battery O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

It O
connected O
to O
my O
5Ghz O
wireless O
network O
perfectly O
. O

It O
can O
fit O
the O
computer O
( O
macbook O
pro O
) O
, O
a O
charger O
, O
a O
phone O
and O
a O
small O
wallet O
. O

I O
choose O
therefore O
to O
give O
them O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
doubt O
that O
this O
is O
a O
" O
wolf O
in O
sheeps O
clothing O
" O
type O
of O
product O
and O
that O
it O
will O
give O
me O
good O
value O
. O

but O
just O
a O
heads O
up O
, O
if O
you O
were O
thinking O
of O
using O
it O
for O
A2DP O

6gz O
AMD O

Vision O
" O

but O
i O
reccomend O
hi O
- O
speed O
wi O

fi O
or O
it O
wo O

fast O

What O
was O
most O
important O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
while O
carrying O
a O
camera O
, O
flash O
, O
lenses O
, O
batteries O
, O
I O
- O
pod O
, O
camcorder O
, O
memory O
cards O
etc O
. O

they O
key O
) O
this O
is O
the O
best O
mini O
computer O
I O
've O
used O
. O

Then O
when O
I O
travel O
I O
just O
take O
the O
charger O
and O
cables O
connected O
with O
me O
. O

A O
string O
and O
tin O
can O
would O
be O
louder O
. O

I O
think O
the O
pricing O
is O
in O
the O
sweet O
spot O
between O
cheesy O
( O
no O
names O
) O
and O
ridiculous O
( O
tumi O
, O
anyone O
? O
) O
. O

I O
think O
if O
my O
computer O
is O
fit O
, O
it O
will O
be O
perfect O
..... O

There O
is O
a O
pitfall O
of O
Windows O
7 O
( O
which O
also O
came O
into O
play O
with O
Vista O
) O
... O
the O
" O
WinSXS O
" O
directory O
grows O
to O
ridiculous O
size O
very O
quickly O
. O

works O
fine O
wish O
the O
cord O
was O
longer O
. O

The O
output O
specifications O
are O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
original O
and O
this O
adapter O
is O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
universal O
adapter O
. O

Other O
- O
Unfortunately O
, O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
find O
out O
how O
I O
can O
use O
the O
software O
for O
this O
mouse O
on O
OS O
X O
( O
Mac O
) O
, O
so O
I O
can O
not O
grade O
the O
software O
. O

The O
HP O

is O
small O
and O
unobtrusive O
, O
neatly O
placed O
in O
the O
corner O
of O

I O
ranked O

I O
do O

know O
about O

and O
everything O
works O
fine O
. O

you O
have O
to O
remove O
9 O
screws O
in O
the O
back O
but O
the O
speaker O
itself O
is O
still O
completely O
enclosed O
. O

The O
bass O
is O
strong O
for O
this O
small O
unit O
, O
I O
can O
feel O
the O
vibrations O
from O
the O
music O
as O
I O
type O
. O

I O
just O
received O
it O
yesterday O
and O
used O
it O
on O
our O
deck O
paired O
to O
my O
Iphone O
4s O
. O

The O
material O
is O
n't O
the O
" O
silky O
" O
lens O
cloths O
( O
which O
is O
worthless O
) O
but O
very O
fine O
fiber O
like O
extremely O
short O
velvet O
. O

I O
wanted O
one O
with O
a O
real O
keyboard O
, O
not O
the O
cheap O
Microsoft O
entry O
level O
pressure O
one O
, O
but O
one O
with O
real O
keys O
that O
move O
when O
you O
push O
down O
. O

Seems O
when O
they O
sent O
it O
they O
sent O
it O
through O
the O
mail O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
need O
the O
drivers O
, O
but O
here O
is O
the O
site O
to O
get O
them O
at O

that O
have O
USB O
ports O
in O
that O
sport O
( O
right O
hand O
corner O
near O
monitor O

The O
keys O
are O
small O
and O
more O
suited O
to O
two O
- O
finger O
hunt O
- O
and O
- O
peck O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
return O
it O
, O
although O
it O
matches O
the O
part O

. O

It O
kept O
a O
charge O
for O
90 O
min O

The O

working O
fine O

The O
video O
quality O
so O
far O
is O
fantastic O
, O
no O
dead O
pixels O
. O

This O
is O
an O
ideal O
CPU O
for O
an O
Ultrabook O
. O

If O
your O
in O
a O
quite O
place O
it O
's O
extremely O
loud O
, O
or O
once O
your O
conditioned O
to O
it O
, O
you O
hear O
it O
more O
and O
more O
because O
you O
're O
expecting O
it O
to O
happen O
. O

the O
next O
day O
when O
I O
plugged O
the O
charger O
into O
the O
laptop O
, O
I O
noticed O
it O
said O
the O
battery O
was O
not O
charging O
and O
when O
I O
unplugged O
the O
charger O
the O
laptop O
shutdown O
, O
as O
if O
there O
was O
no O
battery O
. O

The O
wide O
screen O
is O
cool O
but O
it O
is O
harder O
to O
hold O
over O
time O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
this O
computer O
is O
extra O
- O
thin O
and O
an O
optical O
drive O
would O
have O
not O
been O
feasible O
but O
I O
miss O
having O
one O
at O
hand O
. O

I O
doubt O
anyone O
would O
think O
of O
buying O
this O
old O
model O
now O
unless O
they O
were O
buying O
it O
used O
, O
but O
mine O
just O
broke O
which O
after O
4 O
years O
I O
can O
live O
with O
. O

Bright O
side O

I O
hesistate O
to O
buy O
. O

I O
believe O
they O
did O
this O
so O
nothing O
falls O
out O
if O
not O
zipped O
all O
the O
way O
up O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
's O
a O
slightly O
slower O
processor O
, O
there O
is O
a O
GPU O
that O
takes O
off O
some O
of O
the O
load- O
Tweaks O
. O

The O
Medialink O

USB O
Bluetooth O
works O
great O
with O
Windows O

64 O
bit O
Enterprise O
Edition O
, O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
problem O
whatsoever O

If O
you O
would O
like O
a O
device O
that O
will O
make O
shopping O
on O
Amazon O
( O
or O
visiting O
almost O
any O
other O
site O
on O
the O
internet O
) O
a O
trying O
- O
to O
- O
miserable O
experience O
, O
buy O
this O
. O

My O
last O
bag O
started O
to O
rip O
at O
the O
zippers O
... O

The O
other O
reviewers O
have O
already O
done O
a O
good O
job O
of O
describing O
this O
product O
, O
and O
outlining O
the O
deficiencies O
& O
problems O
. O

At O
first O
I O
thought O
the O
tablet O
was O
n't O
sensitive O
enough O
and O
was O
pressing O
too O
hard O
, O
but O
after O
a O
while O
I O
got O
the O
hang O
of O
how O
to O
touch O
it O
. O

Great O
product O

The O
only O
negative O
is O
that O
when O
ripping O
music O
CDs O
in O
iTunes O
, O
I O
only O
get O
about O
2 O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
I O
'm O
on O
top O
of O
the O
features O
of O
the O
modern O
backpack O

I O
love O
Amazon O
Prime O
. O

the O
SSD O
and O
touch O
screen O
were O
just O
a O
bonus O
. O

So O
that O
leaves O
it O
as O
a O
reasonably O
average O
thin O
- O
and O
- O
light O
ultrabook O
with O
good O
build O
quality O
but O
not O
much O
else O
going O
for O
it O
. O

sdhc).Really O
, O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
got O
it O
was O
for O
the O
keyboard O
. O

and O
I O
was O
impressed O
at O
how O
well O
they O
did O
installing O
it O
, O
and O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
them O
. O

Always O
having O
photos O
, O
videos O

music O
available O
anywhere O
in O

been O

I O

all O
open O

everything O

held O
in O

and O
not O
having O
to O
swap O
out O

I O
owned O
the O

and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
watched O
an O
entire O

with O
no O

so O
i O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
the O

they O
provided O

Bad O

I O
put O
my O
device O
in O
a O

then O
loop O
the O

up O
around O
a O

Cheap O

About O
the O
only O
thing O
it O

let O
me O
do O
is O
use O
my O

Then O
one O

started O

I O

was O
purchased O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
used O
but O
it O
was O
from O
a O
family O
friend O
, O
who O
got O
it O
from O
some O
guy O
who O
passed O
away O
and O
hardly O
used O
it O
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
, O
if O
you O
use O
a O
laptop O
and O
connect O
the O
printer O
/ O
scanner O
using O
USB O
, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
to O
have O
the O
printer O
turned O
off O
when O
you O
connect O
it O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
, O
light O
, O
with O
good O
specifications O
. O

Very O
convenient O
and O
useful O
having O
a O
universal O
plug O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
that O
i O
encountered O
was O
the O
screen O
was O
too O
small O
for O
a O
program O
that O
i O
use O
for O
work O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
the O
Lexar O
JumpDrive O
Sport O
over O
all O
the O
similar O
products O
I O
have O
tried O
, O
mainly O
because O
it O
performed O
smoothly O
with O
both O
the O
MAC O
and O
PC O
and O
never O
required O
a O
re O
- O
boot O
, O
even O
though O
the O
Lexar O
only O
held O
out O
for O
a O
month O
. O

It O
makes O
getting O
to O
my O
computer O
-- O
what O
I O
reach O
for O
most O
of O
the O
time O
-- O
quick O
and O
easy O
. O

Large O

a O

I O
keep O

it O

even O

they O

It O

no O

my O
last O

" O
MSI O

, O
the O

is O
HUGE O
! O

Works O
great O
. O

The O
dock O
was O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
I O
got O
the O
Transformer O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
ended O
up O
being O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
the O
Transformer O
. O

Several O
months O
ago O
the O
left O
mouse O
button O
started O
to O
fail O

are O
just O
the O
speakers O
of O
course O
and O
they O
sound O
good O
to O
me O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
order O
one O
size O
larger O
than O
your O
laptop O
screen O
size O
and O
everything O
should O
work O
out O
fine O
. O

It O
is O
incredibly O
responsive O
to O
touch O
, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
fastest O
to O
start O
, O
from O
a O
cold O
start O
to O
internet O
browsing O
, O
it O
only O
takes O
5 O
seconds O
. O

and O
they O
're O
functions O
of O
the O
arrows O
on O
this O
keyboard O
layout O
. O

Recommended O
, O
but O
test O
all O
ports O
after O
purchase O
and O
check O
for O
driver O
updates O
. O

Got O
ta O
love O
it O
for O
the O
price O
and O
usage O
. O

While O
it O
will O
hold O
the O
10 O
. O
1 O
inch O
tablet O
it O
will O
fall O
backward O
at O
the O
slightest O
touch O
. O

The O
other O
novelty O
here O
is O
the O
retractable O
cords O
. O

the O
" O
one O
piece O
" O
look O
of O
the O
flush O

I O
tried O
an O
SSD O
but O
this O
motherboard O
does O
not O
play O
well O
with O
the O
SandForce O
SSD O
controller O
. O

Switching O
from O
XP O
to O
OSX O
, O
the O
drive O
is O
quite O
fast O
on O
a O
mac O
and O
does O
not O
need O
any O
special O
software O
or O
drivers O
. O

My O
laptop O
does O
n't O
slide O
on O
it O
like O
other O
people O
have O
mentioned O
theirs O
does O
. O

The O
palm O
rest O
is O
very O
ergonomic O
and O
does O
n't O
lend O
itself O
to O
hand O
/ O
wrist O
fatigue O
. O

I&#8217;ve O
had O
other O
bags O
with O
fancy O
metal O
clasps O
and O
buckles O
that O
would O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
, O
you O
won&#8217;t O
have O
that O
here O
. O

I O
declined O

give O
them O
a O

Potential O
Windows O
migrants O
really O
ought O
to O
look O
before O
they O
leap O
into O
the O
Mac O
OS O
. O

It O
has O
decent O
battery O
life O
( O
5 O
- O
6 O
hours O
after O
~200 O
charge O
cycles O
) O
. O

plus O
it O
was O
getting O
a O
bit O
fuzzy O
on O
edge O
tape O
, O
so O
I O
bought O
an O
another O
XL O

Excellent O
product O

The O
drive O
is O
pretty O
fast O
for O

Please O
do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
that O
operating O
system O

Very O
easy O
to O
connect O
, O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
primarily O
to O
watch O
computer O
( O
online O
) O
movies O
, O
a O
lot O
additional O
entertainment O
. O

Since O
it O
does O
seem O
to O
work O
with O
most O
external O
HDs O
I O
'll O
keep O
it O
but O
move O
it O
to O
a O

that O
is O
all O
it O
needs O
to O
do O

an O

for O
your O

this O
is O
one O
of O
a O
handful O

ridiculously O

options O

8 O

2 O
of O
these O
in O
a O
daisy O
chain O
connected O
to O
a O
4 O
port O
Belkin O
works O
as O
these O
should O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
for O
more O
personal O
use O
. O

when O
battery O
died O
on O
an O
older O
laptop O
looked O
around O
for O
the O
replacement O
before O
deciding O
on O
this O
one O
-- O
replacement O
was O
a O
no O
brainer O
-- O
getting O
at O
least O
four O
hrs O
( O
never O
really O
checked O
) O
of O
heavy O
use-- O

i O
ca O
n't O
even O
tell O
its O
on O
! O

I O
could O
n't O
ask O
for O
more O
. O

Great O
/ O
stylish O
case O
for O
a O
macbook O
pro O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
bracket O
that O
one O
of O
the O
round O
speakers O
can O
be O
partially O
inserted O
into O
but O
there O
is O
only O
one O
of O
these O
included O
though O
there O
are O
two O
round O
speakers O
. O

These O
speakers O
are O
perfect O
little O
gems O
! O

Why O
carry O
one O
with O
me O
when O
I O
can O
have O
one O
at O
home O
and O
one O
at O
work O
and O
one O
in O
my O
suitcase O
. O

Too O
bad O
, O
as O
I O
would O
rate O
this O
computer O
as O
a O
5 O
otherwise O
. O

Watch O
out O
for O
the O
" O
power O
option O
" O
that O
you O
are O
using O
. O

For O
awhile O
Amazons O
shipping O
was O
getting O
a O
little O
sloppy O
but O
the O
last O
few O
orders O
I O
have O
made O
were O
just O
great O
, O
so O

I O
also O
wanted O
to O
add O
that O
Amazon O
rocks O
! O
! O

In O
my O
line O
of O
work O
( O
IT O
/ O
Programming O
) O

so O
it O
looks O
sleek O
and O
like O

Overall O
, O
pretty O
happy O
with O
purchase O
and O
recommended O
. O

Using O
the O
metro O
browser O
and O
watching O
Amazon O
movies O
I O
'm O
getting O
around O
7hrs O
but O
using O
the O
desktop O
browser O

The O
best O
design O
of O
this O
bag O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
the O
separate O
padded O
laptop O
storage O
area O
which O
includes O
a O
strap O
to O
tightly O
secure O
your O
laptop O
in O
place O
. O

But O
with O
a O
screw O
driver O
and O
about O
five O
minutes O
, O
it O
can O
be O
removed O
easily O
enough O
. O

Size O
: O
I O
got O
the O
large O
bag O
. O

I O
just O
hot O
glued O
it O
back O
together O

So O
, O
I O
had O
to O
get O
out O
an O
old O
PC O
I O
had O
laying O
around O
to O
use O
this O
. O

Web O
pages O
load O
and O
open O
faster O
than O
on O
the O
Mini O
( O
ad O
block O
pro O
extension O
is O
key O
) O
. O

Case O
is O
matte O
black O
satin O
finish O
. O

So O
I O
bit O
the O
bullet O
and O
spent O
the O
extra O
money O
on O
this O
one O
and O
am O
so O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Ethernet O

and O
works O
as O
it O
should O
. O

" O
autorun O
. O
exe O
" O
and O
click O
" O
extract O
all"4 O
. O

Opening O
it O
up O
required O
removing O
the O
warranty O
sticker O
, O
which O
was O
OK O
as O
it O
is O
now O
out O
of O
warranty O
anyway O
. O

But O
the O
laptop O
is O
only O
a O
small O
portion O
of O
what O
I O
carry O
. O

This O
short O
cord O
greatly O
reduces O
what O
I O
have O
to O
carry O
. O

complemented O

Updates O
that O
should O
have O
taken O
15 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
( O
based O
upon O
my O
experience O
of O
installing O
XP O
and O
all O
of O
the O
updates O
on O
my O
4 O
year O
old O
case O
computer O
) O
wound O
up O
taking O
quite O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

I O
got O
this O
bag O
for O
my O
17 O
" O
HP O
Laptop O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
set O
of O
speakers O
to O
hook O
up O
to O
a O
Sirius O
Stiletto O
home O
dock O
so O
that O
I O
could O
listen O
to O
Sirius O
while O
in O
my O
home O
office O
. O

They O
look O
pretty O
cool O
, O
but O
personally O
, O
I O
like O
my O
speakers O
up O
, O
and O
out O
of O
the O
way O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

It O
is O
also O
something O
one O
can O
do O
with O
two O
small O
basic O
screwdrivers O
. O

Easy O
to O
read O
and O
understand O
. O

Be O
wary O
of O
this O
issue O
) O

I O
used O
to O
build O
my O
own O
computers O
. O

For O
the O
current O
price O
( O
under O
thirty O
dollars O
) O
, O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
bags O
for O
the O
buck O
. O

Very O
lightweight O
, O
supports O
my O
17 O
inch O
Dell O
. O

This O
is O
completely O
understandable O
, O
just O
thought O
I O
'd O
mention O
that O
. O

and O
it O
is O
as O
cheap O
as O
no O
name O
brand O
. O

It O
's O
completely O
portable O
, O
packs O
a O
rich O
sound O
and O
is O
good O
value O
for O
money O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
to O
the O
Bose O
equivalent O
for O
example O
. O

Once O
I O
charged O
it O
up O
and O
turned O
it O
on O
, O
it O
booted O
up O
fairly O
quick O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
I O
got O
to O
play O
around O
with O
Windows O
8 O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
like O
portability O
and O
this O
is O
the O
size O
of O
a O
small O
phone O
if O
you O
intend O
on O
walking O
with O
it O
in O
your O
pocket O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
I O
'm O
changing O
the O
OS O
to O
Windows O
7 O
RC O
instead O
of O
the O
horrible O
Vista O
Home O
that O
comes O
pre O
- O
installed O
. O

The O
Air O
has O
one O
, O
which O
I O
really O
liked O
. O

as O
good O
as O
the O
$ O
15 O
ones O
_ O
so O
for O
$ O
4 O
you O
're O
getting O
a O
good O
deal O
. O

I O
had O
to O
use O
a O
stylus O
while O
visiting O
someone O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
as O
a O
gown O
and O
gloves O
were O
required O
when O
visiting O
, O
and O
gloves O
seriously O
interfere O
with O
using O
the O
iPad O
's O
touchscreen O
. O

I O
checked O
out O
Chrome O
's O
web O
store O
and O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
options O
( O
compared O
to O
the O
Play O
store O

Turns O
out O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
the O
power O
button O
down O
past O
the O
beep O
. O

I O
also O
liked O
the O
idea O
that O
you O
can O
download O
the O
open O
- O
source O
Rockbox O
software O
to O
improve O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
player O
. O

I O
got O
this O
at O
an O
Apple O
store O
and O
while O
I O
agree O
it O
feels O
overpriced O
( O
as O
most O
stuff O
in O
Apple O
stores O
is O
) O

Get O
the O
right O
torx O
driver O
and O
screw O
drivers O
BEFORE O
you O
do O
anything O
! O

My O

will O
now O
be O
a O
constant O
companion O
of O
not O
only O

vacations O
as O
well O

Saved O
me O
from O
having O
to O
watch O
Vanessa O

in O

I O
'd O
prefer O
something O
with O
an O
offset O
layout O
( O
i. O
e. O
where O
the O
keys O
are O
n't O
aligned O
in O
neat O
vertical O
columns O
) O
, O
but O
it O
works O
well O
enough O
regardless O

I O
refuse O
to O
replace O
something O
that O
craps O
out O
so O
quickly O
. O

Its O
nice O
, O
quality O
looks O
decent O
. O

It O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
they O
could O
be O
tucked O
in O
or O
away O
somehow O
. O

I O
worry O
a O
bit O
of O
how O
much O
pressure O
it O
is O
squeezing O
it O
with O
. O

the O
face O
tracking O
is O
able O
to O
be O

I O

not O

they O

try O
this O
before O
they O
started O

them.-1 O

I O
buy O
lots O
of O
LED O
monitors O
for O
work O
and O
often O
buy O
ViewSonics O
because O
if O
nothing O
else O
, O
they O
are O
at O
least O
predictable O
. O

It O
seems O
sturdy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
stays O
cool O
too O
. O

While O
the O
USB O
was O
a O
little O
low O
frame O
rate O
and O
slowed O
my O
mouse O
slightly O
, O
running O
the O
video O
to O
the O
HDMI O
and O
using O
the O
USB O
monitor O
as O
my O
desktop O
display O
works O
AWESOME O
! O

Unfortunately O
, O
there O
was O
no O
AC O
adapter O
in O
the O
box O
. O

Overall O
it O
's O
a O
good O
product O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
gave O
out O
the O
exact O
description O
of O
the O
product O
! O

It O
works O
well O
in O
both O
my O
Kodak O
and O
Nikon O
digital O
cameras O
. O

I O
have O
an O
exspensive O
120hz O
3d O
acer O
but O
this O
one O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

Eventually O
, O
I O
turned O
off O
my O
Windows O
XP O
wireless O
feature O

I O
have O
had O
varying O
levels O
of O
success O
with O
the O
other O
cables O
on O
Amazon O
( O
there O
are O
several O
that O
range O
from O
.99 O
- O
5 O
. O
00 O
) O
, O
however O
I O
will O
never O
go O
anywhere O
else O
now O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
apprehensive O
about O
how O
usable O
this O
system O
would O
be O
, O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
decent O
basic O
equipment O
that O
'll O
take O
care O
of O
your O
laptop O
for O
$ O
29 O
you O
found O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
little O
set O
. O

I O
also O
love O
it O
. O

just O
one O
thing O
. O

Pretty O
much O
anything O
. O

is O
in O

I O
ordered O
this O
Belkin O

0 O
hub O
just O
three O
days O
ago O
, O
and O
found O
it O
waiting O
at O
the O
door O
today O
! O

This O
one O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
! O

I O
compared O
the O
speeds O
of O
an O
Intel O
330 O
SSD O
in O
this O
enclosure O
vs. O
a O
SIIG O
SATA O
6Gb O

I O
've O
had O
the O
first O
one O
for O
two O
years O
and O
no O
problems O
of O
any O
sort O
. O

and O
you O
just O
brush O
your O
finger O
against O
it O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
issue O
, O
but O
definitely O
something O
to O
consider O
when O
purchasing O
the O
bag O
. O

I O
really O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
zippable O
flap O
( O
or O
something O
) O
for O
greater O
protection O
( O
against O
dust O
etc O
) O
, O
and O
some O
peace O
of O
mind O
( O
I O
was O
afraid O
that O
something O
would O
fall O
out O
) O
. O

fits O
in O
small O
camera O

that O
I O
have O
attached O
to O
my O

. O

The O

in O
the O
back O
fits O
the O
charging O
cord O
or O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
or O
some O
small O
item O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
buying O
from O
this O
seller O
and O
if O
anyone O
needs O
a O
laptop O
keyboard O
like O
this O
one O
or O
for O
any O
other O
laptop O
, O
buy O
it O
from O
this O
seller O
. O

It O
boots O
AMAZINGLY O
fast O
. O

At O
first O
it O
would O
n't O
play O
DVDs O
, O
but O
then O
I O
read O
and O
implemented O
the O
review O
" O
Works O
Just O
Fine O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
truly O
mobile O
laptop O
to O
fit O
with O
my O
lifestyle O
and O
work O
needs O
, O
which O
for O
me O
included O
a O
smartphone O
, O
tablet O
, O
mobile O
laptop O
, O
and O
a O
large O
laptop O
/ O
desktop O
replacement O
. O

I O
can O
boldly O
state O
than O
Win8 O
preloaded O

... O
it O
will O
eventually O
loose O

I O
travel O
for O
work O
quite O
a O
bit O
and O
was O
sick O
of O
carrying O
a O
messenger O
bag O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

so O
I O
guess O
those O
are O
good O
features O
if O
you O
need O
those O
. O

I O
can O
change O
the O
volume O
by O
using O
the O
settings O
charm O
, O
as O
well O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
great O
if O
there O
were O
a O
volume O
button O
or O

They O
work O
with O
cleansing O
sprays O
and O
with O
larger O
screens O
as O
well O

It O
's O
small O
enough O
to O
pack O
along O
if O
I O
'm O
going O
out O
- O
of O
- O
town O
, O
too O
. O

OK O
that O
does O
n't O
really O
tell O
you O
anything O

The O
" O
kit O
" O
comes O
with O
everything O
you O
need O
: O
screen O
protector O
, O
wet O
spray O
, O
cloth O
, O
and O
a O
squeegee O
. O

and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Since O
it O
does O
not O
work O
( O
can O
not O
connect O
) O
it O
gets O
1 O
star O
only O
. O

I O
installed O
it O
and O
immediately O
noticed O
the O
sparkling O
effect O
. O

I O
place O
the O
screen O
at O
a O
certain O
viewing O
angle O
and O
it O
starts O
to O
sag O
. O

This O
backpack O
handles O
it O
w/o O
difficulty O
as O
it O
stands O
22 O
" O
tall O
, O
13 O
" O
wide O
at O
it O
's O
base O
. O

She O
really O
likes O
them O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
is O
better O
than O
the O
internal O
speakers O
in O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
going O
Ireland O
or O
the O
UK O
. O

Its O
lightweight O
, O
compact O
, O
and O
has O
a O
large O
enough O
screen O
to O
enjoy O
movies O
on O
a O
plane O
. O

Shortly O
after O
we O
got O
it O
connected O
, O
it O
required O
an O
update O
, O
that O
ran O
itself O
. O

Overall O
: O
5/5 O
stars O
, O
works O
so O
far O
, O
but O
only O
time O
will O
tell O
if O
it O
solved O
the O
" O
Plugged O

. O

This O
has O
occurred O
in O
all O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
and O
night O
and O
, O
since O
the O
TV O
is O
in O
our O
bedroom O
, O
can O
be O
quite O
annoying O
. O

A O
co O
- O
worker O
has O
2 O
of O
these O
( O
for O
herself O
and O
her O
husband O
) O
and O
says O
she O
and O
her O
kids O
have O
treated O
it O
quite O
roughly O
without O
any O
screen O
damage O
. O

After O
using O
Windows O
PC O
's O
for O
years O
; O
I O
'm O
amazed O
how O
simple O
it O
was O
to O
learn O
using O
this O
computer O
. O

But O
this O
is O
different O
from O
changing O
the O
operating O
system O
. O

So O
far O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
two O
months O

After O
learning O
that O
heat O
hastens O
the O
demise O
of O
laptop O
batteries O
, O
I O
looked O
into O
getting O
something O
to O
cool O
down O
my O
daughter O
's O
laptop O
. O

Alas O
, O
Polaroid O
sued O
and O
the O
Kodaks O
vanished O
. O

Fast O
speed O
and O
works O
very O
great O
. O

But O
, O
it O
basically O
worked O
, O
after O
two O
and O
half O
months O
of O
screwing O
around O
with O
returns O
, O
updates O
, O

, O

I O
may O

it O
will O

I O
have O
no O

to O

After O
the O

there O
were O
no O
more O
of O
those O
bargain O
packets O
in O
either O
household O
. O

i O
have O
n't O
compared O
it O
to O
anything O
else O
, O
so O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
" O
fast O
" O
it O
is O
, O
but O
it O
was O

painfully O

and O
I O
'm O
so O
happy O
I O
did O
- O
saved O
at O

$ O

. O

but O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
us O
at O
all O
. O

It O
likes O
to O
fall O
apart O
when O
twisting O
it O
. O

But O
I O
then O
needed O
a O
second O
, O
longer O
cord O
to O
have O
both O
hooked O
up O
. O

sorry O
to O
hear O
all O
the O
bad O
reviews O

The O

cracks O
up O
at O
times O

Besides O
good O

, O
I O
like O
it O

Lets O
get O
back O
to O
that O

that O

on O
how O
to O

for O

a O

and O
some O

It O

life O
is O

. O

I O
own O
a O

G O
Nano O
. O

The O
TV O
thinks O
the O
connection O
is O
wired O
since O
an O
Ethernet O
cable O
connects O
from O
this O
bridge O
to O
the O
TV O
. O

and O
it O
just O
keeps O
going O
. O

It O
's O
got O
Intel O
's O
latest O
great O
budget O
duo O
- O
core O
processor O
( O
P6100 O
, O
without O
hyper O
- O
threading O
capability O
) O
, O
not O
a O
stripped O
down O
single O
- O
core O
Celeron O
processor O
. O

With O
that O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
if O
you O
want O
the O
hear O
music O
the O
way O
the O
musicians O
and O
studio O
engineers O
intended O
buy O
these O
earphones O
. O

Despite O
being O
recommended O
by O
Microsoft O
, O
this O
hub O
( O
and O
all O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
hubs O
) O
used O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
Windows O
7 O
64-bit O
during O
the O
boot O
process O
, O
but O
Microsoft O
has O
finally O
released O
an O
update O
in O
2013 O
that O
fixed O
this O
problem O
. O

Once O
it O
's O
powered O
on O
, O
a O
blue O
light O
comes O
on O
below O
the O
mouth O
and O
stays O
lit O
until O
you O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

I O
am O
very O
please O
with O
the O
product O
and O
I O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
even O
though O
I O
have O
a O
desk O
top O
. O

Setup O
was O
very O
easy O
just O
using O
the O
quick O
set O
up O
card O
. O

I O
also O
seriously O
considered O
the O
Sony O
Vaio O
Z O
and O
while O
impressive O
in O
specs O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
very O
expensive O
machine O
which O
is O
made O
more O
for O
portability O
and O

If O
that O
does O
not O
help O
, O
a O
mat O
will O
be O
in O
its O
future O
. O

This O
is O
my O
families O
3rd O
Macbook O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

But O
, O
my O
other O
Linksys O
items O
have O
worked O
so O
well O
and O
have O
been O
so O
simple O
to O
install O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
needed O
to O
contact O
them O
. O

I O
seriously O
love O
this O
screen O
and O
highly O
highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

It O
charges O
quickly O
and O
wraps O
up O
easily O
for O
travel O
. O

I O
was O
a O
more O
than O
a O
little O
leary O
of O
ordering O
this O
. O

I O
happened O
to O
have O
one O
old O
elastic O
band O
from O
a O
previous O
lens O
cap O
that O
got O
detached O
from O
it O
, O
so O
I O
reattached O
it O
to O
this O
pinch O
front O
lens O
cap O
for O
my O
Canon O
Rebel O
to O
make O
it O
perfecto O
. O

Purchased O
battery O
for O
wife O
's O
older O
G4 O
. O

It O
works O
but O
not O
as O
well O
as O
I O
hoped O
for O
. O

A O
robustly O
built O
webcam O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
operate O
and O
that O
too O
for O
the O
price O
is O
unbelievable O
but O
it O
is O
true O
; O
the O
Logitech O
webcam O
is O
a O
delight O
for O
those O
who O
use O
video O
chat O
often O
. O

So O
, O
to O
conclude O
, O
this O
thing O
does O
nothing O
, O
at O
least O
with O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

It O
charges O
my O
X230 O
normally O
. O

The O
drops O
beaded O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
any O
absorption O
of O
water O
when O
the O
bag O
was O
splashed O
( O
most O
of O
it O
ran O
right O

The O
cord O
was O
used O
and O
re O
- O
wound O
. O

The O
color O
does O
n't O
match O
the O
color O
of O
the O
macbook2 O
) O

The O
list O
price O
looks O
good O
to O
me O
, O
and O
after O
several O
months O
of O
use O
the O
card O
has O
not O
failed O
or O
had O
any O
problem O
other O
than O

Gave O
one O
to O
my O
step O
father O
and O
he O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
high O
quality O
of O
sound O
, O
what O
a O
big O
difference O
it O
made O
on O
both O
his O
IPHONE O

Bought O
the O
New O

lost O
the O

for O
it O

This O
is O
our O
first O
tablet O
( O
Asus O

so O
we O
wanted O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
scratches O
and O
dropping O
. O

My O
quality O
is O
better O
and O
my O

does O
n't O
drop O

no O

any O

A O
big O
advantage O
of O
this O

over O

is O
that O
it O
's O
easy O
to O

to O
fit O
the O

preferences O
of O
the O

manufacturers O

I O
thought O
this O
would O
make O
it O
worth O
the O
* O
higher O
price O

The O
cover O
does O
n't O
add O
a O

I O
had O
expected O
it O
to O

I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O

if O
I O
had O
to O
rely O
on O
this O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
I O
'd O
look O
elsewhere O
, O
but O
it O
has O
n't O
let O
me O
down O
yet O
when O
I O
've O
needed O
it O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
stayed O
horrible O
and O
actually O
seemed O
to O
get O
worse O
, O
and O
the O
constant O
static O
and O
interference O
meant O
that O
the O
speakers O
mostly O
produced O
white O
noise O
. O

so O
we O
were O
sharing O
the O
plug O
she O
brought O
. O

Please O
note O
that O
there O
are O
different O
sizes O
for O
each O
different O
Macbook O
, O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
order O
the O
one O
that O
fits O
yours O
. O

Typing O
on O
it O
right O
now O
. O

Some O
possible O
reasons O
they O
gave O
for O
the O
problem O
were O
: O
I O
was O
using O
Win O
. O

That O
said O
, O
I O
can O
see O
the O
difference O
when O
doodling O
with O
the O
pressure O
levels O
. O

This O
TV O
has O
pretty O
grey O
- O
colored O
blacks O
, O
which O
annoys O
me O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
two O
factors O
that O
push O
everyone O
out O
to O
HDD O
base O
: O
the O
more O
expensive O
price O
and O
much O
less O
capacity O
. O

but O
they O
are O
not O
necessarily O
abusive O
with O
it O
) O
. O

Its O
nice O
to O
come O
back O
home O
, O
and O
do O
casual O
computer O
work O
like O
browsing O
, O
watching O
videos O
, O
and O
mail O
stuff O
on O
Mac O
. O

I O
am O
using O
this O
with O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
( O
most O
recent O
model O
, O
up O
- O
to O
- O
date O
OS O
X O
) O
. O

; O
hard O
drive O
in O
it O
. O

another O
problem O
is O
with O
the O
small O
keyboard O
. O

It O
received O
good O
reviews O
both O
on O
Amazon O
and O
YouTube O
despite O
the O
rather O
cheesy O
name O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
type O
of O
powerline O
product O
we O
have O
used O
, O
the O
other O
being O
NetGear O
. O

I O
used O
it O
to O
hook O
up O
my O
older O
Macbook O
Pro O
to O
my O
new O
HDTV O
. O

The O
array O
of O
pockets O
allows O
me O
to O
neatly O
organize O
everything O
I O
need O
on O
the O
go O
to O
conduct O
business O
or O
pleasure O
technology O
wise O
. O

The O
TF201 O
is O
getting O
outdated O
really O
quickly O
, O
but O
if O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
, O
I O
'd O
choose O
this O
. O

it O
quit O
in O
less O
than O
8 O
months O
. O

Since O
they O
are O
just O
about O
what O
I O
'd O
pay O
in O
parts O
and O
time O
I O
ordered O
it O
on O
Amazon O
and O
got O
it O
within O
a O
few O
days O
. O

The O
people O
who O
complain O
of O
it O
breaking O
on O
removing O
should O
read O
the O
instructions O
. O

The O
sleeve O
is O
a O
little O
stretchy O
and O
fits O
snugly O
. O

I O
have O
an O
eMachines O
E725 O
laptop O
( O
which O
is O
listed O
in O
the O
product O
title O
) O
. O

Tracks O
well O
and O
is O
responsive O
light O
weight O
and O
comfortable O
to O
use O
for O
long O
stretches O
.. O

Purchased O
this O
item O
to O
replace O
the O
original O
adaptor O
for O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

The O
thumb O
locks O
are O
too O
small O
to O
lock O
off O
the O
rotating O
parts O
. O

Not O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
as O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
operation O
one O
bit O
. O

Screen O
is O
okay O
, O
definitely O
bright O
on O
the O
bright O
settings O
, O
however O
it O
is O
glossy O
and O
VERY O
REFLECTIVE O
. O

Great O
price O
for O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

It O
is O
durable O
and O
they O
throw O
in O
a O
free O
keyboard O
cover O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
when O
she O
decided O
she O
liked O
the O
cost O
- O
savings O
associated O
with O
the O
linux O
- O
based O
netbook O
- O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
Windows O
8 O
would O
benefit O
from O
a O
touch O
screen O
, O
but O
I O
knew O
I O
was O
n't O
getting O
one O
with O
this O
product O
when O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

When O
I O
tested O
it O
by O
running O
PCMark O
Vantage O
, O
the O
laptop O
automatically O
shut O
down O
itself O
half O
- O
way O
through O
the O
test O
because O
the O
temperature O
of O
the O
CPU O
had O
gone O
well O
over O
95c O

The O
" O
around O
the O
back O
of O
the O
neck O
" O
headset O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
it O
does O
take O
up O
a O
lot O
less O
space O
than O
standard O
headsets O
. O

I O
use O
it O
to O
project O
my O

to O
my O

After O
overcoming O
the O
transition O
from O
windows O
7 O
to O
8 O
, O
I O
've O
come O
to O
appreciate O
the O
T100 O
. O

The O
online O
chat O
can O
not O
answer O
my O
question O
but O
created O
a O
case O
for O
it O
and O
forwarded O
my O
question O
to O
someone O
else O
. O

It O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
get O
it O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
Note O
8 O
and O
when O
I O
did O
, O
I O
found O
that O
the O
" O
Q O
, O
A O
and O
Z O
" O
keys O
would O
not O
function O
at O
all O
. O

dittmerThis O
one O
feels O
and O
looks O
very O
cheap O
. O

I O
can O
easily O
hear O
everything O
, O
even O
with O
the O
shower O
going O
. O

The O
great O
thing O
about O
the O
speakers O
is O
that O
they O
're O
loud O
, O
more O
than O
audible O
in O
a O
noisy O
room O
. O

The O
size O
is O
a O
welcome O
change O
from O
the O
routine O
harassment O
I O
get O
from O
overzealous O
mall O
security O
who O
thinks O
I O
'm O
out O
to O
make O
a O
quick O
buck O
selling O
pictures O
of O
mall O
scenes O
and/or O
architecture O
everytime O

I O
am O
not O
an O
impatient O
man O
, O
I O
still O
run O
a O
Socket O
A O
Desktop O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
latest O
greatest O

One O
other O
little O
thing O
: O
the O
power O
switch O
is O
tiny O
and O
a O
bit O
difficult O
to O
use O
as O
it O
does O
n't O
protrude O
very O
far O
from O
the O
back O
panel O
, O
but O
that O
's O
probably O
to O
keep O
it O
from O
breaking O
easily O
or O
snagging O
on O
the O
case O

I O
really O
did O
n't O
expect O
this O
to O
be O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is O
. O

The O
island- O
style O
chiclet O
keys O
have O
great O
travel O
and O
feedback O
, O
are O
extremely O
comfortable O
and O
easy O
to O
type O
on O
, O
and O
within O
the O
first O
30 O
minutes O
of O
using O
the O
Chromebook O
I O
was O
typing O
error O
free O
and O
at O
my O
usual O
speed O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
of O
this O
charging O
set O
by O
Nyko O
. O

It O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
it O
had O
a O
slot O
so O
you O
could O
put O
the O
seat O
belt O
through O
it O
and O
then O
secure O
it O
. O

It O
's O
been O
couple O
of O
weeks O
since O
i O
bought O
this O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O

Primarily O
because O
the O
only O
USB3 O
devices O
I O
own O
are O
the O
two O
external O
hard O
drives O
( O
and O
one O
USB3 O
Thumb O
drive O
always O
plugged O
into O
the O
internal O
port O
of O
the O
Desktop O
's O
USB3 O
card O
) O
. O

I O
replaced O
it O
with O
the O
Victorinox O
Comfort O
Fit O
Shoulder O
Strap O
, O
which O
I O
also O
bought O
on O
Amazon O
. O

I O
replaced O
a O
MiniDV O
camera O
with O
this O
and O
what O
a O
pleasure O
it O
is O
to O
not O
have O
to O
fiddle O
with O
tapes O
that O
jam O
, O
are O
slow O
to O
download O
to O
PC O
, O
slow O
to O
move O
from O
scene O
- O
to O
- O
scene O
, O
etc O
. O

Ultimately O
while O
you O
will O
see O
an O
increase O
in O
performance O
with O
the O
TP O
Link O
card O
, O
a O
much O
better O
and O
cheaper O
investment O
would O
be O
with O
antennas O
( O
or O
a O
USB O
extension O
cable O
if O
you O
use O
a O
dongle O
style O
USB O
adapter O
. O

Would O
recommend O
as O
a O
definite O
add O
on O
for O
others O
purchasing O
this O
size O
tablet O
. O

I O
installed O
a O
few O
of O
the O
programs O
I O
need O
, O
like O
quicken O
. O

I O
also O
tried O
the O
Toshiba O
forums O
but O
no O
luck O
on O
finding O
a O
solution O
. O

The O
Macally O
power O
adapter O
charges O
my O
computer O
just O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Apple O
version O

The O
details O
of O
the O
product O
on O
amazon O
says O
it O
fits O
a O
12&#34 O
; O
laptop O
. O

The O
motherboard O
went O
out O
on O
me O
twice O
, O
all O
though O
I O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
turion O
64 O
dual O
core O
, O
I O
needed O
something O
more O
stable O

It O
's O
overall O
a O
little O
shorter O
than O
the O
OEM O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
knock O
a O
star O
off O
it O
. O

After O
reading O
mixed O
reviews O
regarding O
high O
definition O
video O
playback O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
purchase O
this O
other O
one O
instead O
. O

I O
hear O
it O
's O
harmless O
, O
but O
plan O
on O
calling O
Corsair O
tomorrow O
and O
seeing O
what O
they O
say O
about O
it O
. O

Still O
love O
the O
cable O
and O
am O
considering O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O
second O
one O
for O
another O
Oyen O
Digital O
enclosure O
. O

I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
popped O
the O
battery O
in O
and O
easily O
connected O
my O
iPhone O
via O
Bluetooth O
. O

I O
've O
been O
told O
this O
would O
n't O
speed O
up O
my O
internet O
( O
duh O
I O
knew O
that O
) O
but O

After O
only O
a O
few O
months O
of O
use O
, O
the O
locking O
mechanism O
quit O
working O
and O
will O
no O
longer O
clip O
into O
the O
tablet O
. O

Great O
sounding O

for O
the O
price O

n't O
had O
any O

with O
the O

it O

you O
can O
us O
this O
with O
a O

USB O
device O
and O
share O
the O
access O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
'm O
extremely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
case O
and O
glad O
that O
I O
had O
the O
foresight O
to O
purchase O
it O
( O
At O
a O
negligible O
cost O

comparatively O
) O
when O
buying O
the O

I O
use O
this O
for O

that O
it O
will O
only O
take O
up O
to O

GB O
) O
. O

my O
IM7 O
was O
to O
expect O
too O
much O
from O
such O
a O
small O
unit O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
good O
also O
. O

The O
shipping O
was O
more O
than O
what O
I O
thought O

This O
thing O
just O
works O
as O
advertised O
, O
and O
does O
it O
well O
. O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
ZAGG O
does O
not O
realize O
an O
iPad O
is O
ten+ O
times O
the O
area O
of O
an O
iphone O
. O

The O
best O
results O
came O
when O
I O
had O
it O
tilted O
with O
fans O
on O
, O
and O
that O
only O
lowered O
my O
running O
temperature O
by O
1 O
- O
3C O
( O
hard O
to O
pinpoint O
because O
actual O
events O
in O
my O
game O
affected O
the O
temperature O
more O
... O
) O
, O
really O
an O
insignificant O
amount O
. O

Things O
like O
this O
should O
be O
checked O
and O
fixed O
by O
the O
installer O
. O

The O
contacts O
for O
battery O
to O
laptop O
were O
clean O
but O
reseating O
the O
battery O
did O
the O
trick O

You O
need O
to O
set O
this O
thing O
where O
ur O
not O
gon O
na O
bump O
it O

so O
I O
can O
close O
the O
unit O
, O
and O
still O
have O
the O
unit O
connected O
to O
the O
power O
. O

I O
was O
supplied O
this O
product O
free O
of O
charge O
with O
no O
other O
conditions O
other O
than O
my O
writing O
a O
fair O
and O
honest O
review O
-- O
which O
this O
is O
. O

I O
also O
would O
prefer O
for O
the O
mouse O
to O
have O
a O
bit O
more O
heft O
to O
it O
. O

Eventually O
it O
died O
, O
and O
since O
Belkin O
discontinued O
using O
it O
, O
I O
opted O
for O
a O
replacement O
from O
them O
( O
under O
warranty O
) O
for O
a O
larger O
, O
but O
infinitely O
more O
reliable O
F5D8055 O
. O

has O
always O
been O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
many O
are O
looking O
for O
one O
. O

I O
had O
a O
netbook O
but O
it O
was O
slower O
than O
slow O
. O

So O
- O
so O
far O
, O
good O
value O
. O

Where O
this O
Ultrabook O
falls O
short O
is O
as O
a O
tablet O
, O
because O
it O
is O
awkward O
to O
handle O
. O

The O
material O
of O
the O
case O
is O
soft O
, O
but O
feels O
cheap O
. O

I O
rarely O
find O
myself O
using O
the O
mouse O
anymore O
. O

It O
ended O
up O
he O
had O
no O
power O
to O
the O
charger O
and O
just O
had O
to O
flick O
the O
light O
switch O
. O

No O
more O
leaving O
the O
mouse O
or O
power O
cord O
home O
again O
when O
we O
travel O
! O
! O
! O

Very O
cool O
and O
a O
great O
purchase O
. O

Also O
make O
sure O
you O
position O
the O
fan O
right O
under O
the O
laptops O
intake O
area O
which O
is O
visible O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
recommand O
this O
product O
and O
give O
5 O
stars O
since O
you O
get O
the O
best O
value O
for O
money O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
I O
am O
using O
devices O
that O
have O
very O
good O
reception O
to O
3x O
the O
distance O
... O
including O
reception O
that O
the O
stucco O
exterior O
wall O
. O

I O
would O
feel O
comfortable O
giving O
this O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
or O
a O
younger O
person O
as O
their O
own O
computer O
, O
knowing O
that O
they O
can O
not O
really O
mess O
it O
up O
, O
nor O
would O
they O
be O
confused O
by O
the O
device O
( O
navigation O
is O
much O
more O
logical O
than O
say O
, O
Windows O
8) O
. O

I O
've O
used O
Apple O
products O
for O
the O
past O
bunch O
of O
years O
, O
paid O
the O
price O
for O
them O
mainly O
to O
have O
the O
experience O
I O
have O
on O
this O
sweet O
little O
Chromebook O
, O
namely O
to O
have O
my O
computer O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way O
of O
what O
I O
want O
to O
do O
, O
day O
in O
and O
day O
out O
. O

Great O
picture O
and O
viewing O
angles O
; O
lots O
of O
inputs O
and O
outputs O
; O
and O
a O
well O
designed O
remote O
that O
allows O
chnging O
source O
, O
picture O
view O
aspect O
, O
and O
captioning O
without O
going O
through O
menus O
. O

If O
you O
look O
online O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
this O
problem O
not O
only O
with O
this O
laptop O
but O
with O
many O
different O
brands O
etc O
. O

It O
does O
weigh O
about O
7 O
pounds O
, O
but O
because O
even O
my O
black O
nylon O
rolling O
suitcase O
weighed O
about O
this O
much O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
works O
well O
, O
small O
, O
simple O
, O
lots O
of O
storage O
, O
much O
better O
than O
floppy O
or O
burning O
CDs O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
one O
that O
tells O
you O
how O
much O
time O
you O
have O
left O
before O
needing O
to O
plug O
in O
, O
weird O
. O

If O
the O
disc O
is O
very O
dirty O
or O
dusty O
because O
you O
purchased O
it O
used O
or O
it O
was O
sitting O
in O
your O
basement O
for O
years O
do O
not O
use O
this O
product O
for O
the O
initial O
cleaning O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
looking O
for O
a O
powerhouse O
though O
, O
i O
STRONGLY O
recommend O
getting O
one O
of O
the O
mid O
ranged O
models O
. O

I O
have O
some O
hubs O
on O
the O
other O
desk O
that O
have O
been O
in O
use O
for O
several O
years O
now O
, O
under O
much O
more O
strain O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
gave O
life O
back O
to O
my O
laptop O
that O
I O
thought O
was O
dead O
for O
good O
. O

Shortly O
after O
that O
, O
one O
of O
them O
broke O
. O

Any O
feedback O
on O
what O
to O
use O
this O
device O
with O
would O
be O
greatly O
apprecaited O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
care O
to O
get O
full O
use O
out O
of O
a O
1080p O
TV O
, O
get O
a O
PTV2000 O
or O
above O
, O
not O
this O
shitty O
1st O
generation O
adapter O
. O

I O
've O
already O
purchased O
a O
second O
one O
for O
my O
brothers O
upcoming O
bday O
. O

You O
must O
try O
this O
new O
OS O
. O

Lots O
of O
great O
protection O
available O
but O
the O
whole O
idea O
of O
the O
MAB O
is O
to O
be O
light O
and O
thin O
! O

It O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
work O
well O
for O
holding O
all O
of O
my O
daughters O
Micro O
and O
standard O
SD O
cards O
. O

There O
is O
a O
minimal O
amount O
of O
bloatware O
installed O
. O

OSX O
is O
superior O
in O
my O
opinion O
but O
Win O
7 O
is O
stable O
and O
able O
to O
easily O
run O
XP O
programs O
and O
with O
Google O
chrome O
's O
browser O
a O
breeze O
on O
the O
web O
. O

At O
least O
it O
did O
n't O
cost O
much O
. O

The O
version O
that O
I O
currently O
have O
( O
v2 O
. O
70 O
) O
does O
NOT O
say O
the O
street O
names O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
priced O
Kindle O
Fire O
holder O
, O
that O
looks O
nice O
, O
and O
closes O
at O
the O
top O
with O
a O
velcro O
latch O
that O
holds O
the O
Kindle O
Fire O
in O
. O

I O
will O
be O
retired O
long O
before O
that O
possibility O
would O
ever O
happen O
. O

They O
only O
warranty O
the O
thing O
THREE O
MONTHS O
! O

The O
laptop O
compartment O
is O
nicely O
padded O
on O
one O
side O
. O

The O
mousepad O
now O
works O
fine O
, O
not O
bad O
and O
not O
great O
. O

The O
operator O
Rachel O
said O
she O
could O
n't O
do O
anything O
about O
this O
because O
her O
computer O
did O
n't O
allow O
for O
this O
and O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
to O
corporate O
offices O
in O
Arlington O
NJ O
. O

and O
I O
've O
yet O
to O
hit O
a O
bump O
that O
causes O
the O
static O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
signal O
after O
the O
split O
will O
be O
half O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
original O
signal O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
on O
getting O
a O
new O
one O

Every O
piece O
of O
software O
feels O
brand O
new O
again O
. O

this O
thing O
is O
more O
than O
i O
can O
ask O
for O
. O

It O
's O
shaped O
a O
little O
different O
, O
but O
I O
think O
I O
actually O
like O
this O
design O
better O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
use O
it O
, O
but O
so O
far O
I O
'm O
quite O
happy O
with O
this O
hood O
. O

Brightness O
was O
set O
to O
~ O
70 O
% O
and O
keypad O
backlit O
was O
on O
. O

but O
I O
guess O
the O
internals O
are O
just O
not O
up O
to O
the O
task O
. O

Works O
, O
looks O
generic O
. O

I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
needs O
to O
be O
charging O
their O
MacBook O
computers O
on O
- O
the O
- O
go O
. O

i O
wanted O
to O
use O
two O
external O
monitors O
and O
extend O
the O
screen O
but O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
the O
money O
on O
a O
docing O
bay O
. O

Excellent O
power O
saving O
monitor O
for O
long O
hours O
in O
front O
of O
computer O
no O
stress O
to O
eyes O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
this O
battery O
does O
NOT O
has O
the O
same O
charge O
compared O
to O
Dell O
's O
OEM O
9 O
Cell O
battery O
. O

I O
received O
the O
RAM O
kit O
this O
a. O
m. O
, O
installed O
it O
, O
the O
MBP O
recognized O
it O
, O
and O
I O
am O
now O
running O
it O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
and O
will O
purchase O
again O
. O

At O
this O
point O
one O
of O
two O
things O
happens O
either O
I O
get O
stuck O
using O
monitor O
in O
crappy O
resolution O
( O
makes O
this O
useless O
) O
or O
I O
use O
something O
like O
DisplayConfigX O
to O
add O
resolution O
to O
OS O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
cutting O
it O
too O
short O
on O
the O
sides O
, O
which O
irritates O
me O
. O

A O
minor O
problem O
: O
When O
the O
computer O
wakes O
up O
from O
sleeping O
or O
hibernating O
when O
the O
card O
is O
in O
the O
slot O
, O
it O
reports O
a O
power O
surge O
on O
the O
hub O
. O

I O
am O
so O
pleased O
with O
it O
that O
I O
wanted O
a O
37 O
inch O
Samsung O
LCD O
to O
replace O
the O
32 O
inch O
Sharp O
Aquos O
in O
my O
bedroom O
. O

This O
one O
is O
on O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
that O
is O
never O
moved O
, O
it O
is O
used O
as O
a O
desktop O
computer O
. O

Great O
buy O
! O

Product O
quality O
is O
a O
very O
good O
value O

The O
picture O
is O
clear O
and O
sharp O
going O
from O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
to O
my O
Asus O
24 O

The O
zipper O
on O
mine O
easily O
busted O
once O
I O
tried O
to O
add O
just O
a O
bit O
more O
to O
it O
. O

It O
is O
an O
original O
one O
, O
manofactured O
by O
acer O
, O
so O
you O
're O
sure O
your O
tablet O
is O
safe O
, O
after O
all O
you O
do O
wanna O
protect O
your O
investment O
. O

The O
zipper O
flap O
has O
to O
be O
lifted O
for O
each O
corner O
to O
go O
in O
, O
but O
not O
to O
the O
level O
that O
it O
will O
affect O
either O
the O
tablet O
or O
the O
flap O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
parts O
is O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
a O
guy O
like O
me O
to O
fix O
your O
computer O
anymore O
; O
no O
more O
viruses O
, O
no O
more O
software O
updates O
, O
no O
more O
backing O
up O
your O
computer O
; O
it O
's O
all O
done O
by O
the O
pros O
, O
mostly O
at O
Google O
, O
so O
it O
's O
transparent O
to O
the O
end O
user O
. O

Now O
the O
laptop O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
cooler O
with O
a O
long O
rubber O
band O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
a O
thing O
. O

We O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
portable O
speaker O
for O
our O
laptop O
and O
mobile O
which O
can O
be O
durable O
and O
provides O
good O
sound O
quality O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
love O
it O
. O

My O
wireless O
bar O
went O
from O
one O
bar O
to O
three O
to O
four O
bars O
! O

I O
tapped O
one O
key O
today O
and O
it O
took O
me O
right O
to O
the O
home O
desk O
top O
on O
my O
Nexus O
10 O
. O

For O
the O
price O
I O
'm O
very O
satisfied O
. O

I O
think O
a O
more O
appropriate O
term O
would O
be O
' O
less O
cumbersome O
' O
. O

When O
it O
's O
put O
to O
its O
paces O
it O
definitely O
produces O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
( O
more O
on O
that O
later O
) O
but O
unlike O
my O
previous O
( O
I O
'll O
quit O
the O
* O
cough O

I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
significant O
trackpad O
sensitivity O
decrease O
from O
the O
trackpad O
cover O
. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
, O
however O
, O
the O
numerous O
card O
readers O
, O
could O
be O
very O
helpful O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
mouse O
is O
very O
capable O
to O
conquer O
any O
PC O
game O
, O
and O
useful O
enough O
for O
the O
everyday O
user O
. O

Got O
this O
, O
and O
was O
, O
at O
first O
, O
SHOCKED O
to O
see O
the O
ram O
was O
etched O
( O
little O
parallel O
lines O
etched O
in O
the O
surface O
of O
each O
chip O
) O
, O
as O
if O
these O
were O
rejected O
or O
reused O
chips O
? O

Some O
of O
the O
ink O
transferred O
to O
the O
back O
and O
front O
of O
my O
beloved O
kindle O
! O

If O
an O
average O
battery O
at O
an O
average O
price O
works O
for O
you O
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
this O
battery O
was O
delivered O
in O
a O
timely O
manner O
and O
did O
hold O
a O
charge O
when O
tested O
. O

If O
you O
are O
an O
occasional O
user O
, O
looking O
for O
some O
kind O
of O
one O
time O
backup O
and O
forget O
it O
device O
, O
maybe O
this O
will O
work O
for O
you O
, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
a O
daily O
user O
and O
will O
store O
and O
read O
medium O
to O
large O
sized O
files O
, O
I O
would O
suggest O
looking O
elsewhere O
. O

Given O
the O
battery O
life O
once O
charged O
, O
however O
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
, O
so O
I O
still O
consider O
it O
a O
better O
recharge O
result O
than O
a O
traditional O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
value O
for O
a O
16 O
gb O
class O
6 O
card O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
for O
upgrades O
more O
than O
what O
i O
did O
then O
buy O
something O
else O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
aux O
cords O
they O
ship O
with O
this O
things O
are O
worthless O
, O
mine O
had O
a O
short O
in O
it O
literally O
after O
1 O
week O
of O
use O
. O

Best O
Bluetooth O
adapters O
for O
Windows O
7 O
and O
XP O
running O
on O
my O
laptop O
and O
net O
book O
. O

Mine O
looked O
bad O
after O
about O
1 O
month O
of O
use O
. O

ANYWHERE O
YOU O
GO O

It O

I O
purchased O
the O
Xtreme O
N O
router O
, O
cardbus O
adapter O
, O
and O
PC O
card O
when O
this O
first O
came O
out O
. O

I O
'd O
buy O
again O
without O
reservation O
. O

Amazing O
value O
. O

Bought O
it O
as O
a O
Christmas O
gift O
but O
wish O
I O
had O
kept O
it O
for O
myself O
. O

Unfortunately O
its O
not O
3 O
like O
my O
first O
battery O

For O
reasons O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
, O
my O
iMac O
and O
cable O
company O
modem O
could O
not O
" O
find O
" O
the O
router O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
really O
used O
this O
smaller O
internal O
one O
yet O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
their O
tech O
support O
is O
well O
above O
average O
, O
but O
you O
wo O
n't O
need O
it O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
port O
it O
should O
work O
fine O
. O

The O
hardware O
is O
1080p O
capable O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
support O
1080p O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

da O
should O
make O
it O
boot O
up O
faster O
. O

bar O
16 O
is O
extra O
loud O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
quite O
have O
the O
capabilities O
for O
low O
light O
- O
but O
it O
's O
awfully O
nice O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
some O
of O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O
of O
the O
Apple O
( O
which O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
based O
on O
the O
substantial O
price O
difference O
) O
, O
but O
is O
a O
solid O
laptop O
for O
someone O
on O
a O
budget O
and O
functionally O
, O
is O
sufficient O
for O
most O
of O
what O
the O
average O
user O
will O
need O
a O
laptop O
for O
. O

i O
got O
this O
cuz O
it O
as O
cheap O
u O
get O
what O
u O
pay O
for O
i O
dropped O
it O
once O

Good O
for O
keeping O
your O
sandisk O
chips O
together O

I O
did O
try O
it O
in O
both O
a O
Raidmax O
with O
an O
ATX O
board O
, O
and O
in O
a O
Thermaltake O
case O
with O
a O
micro O
- O
ATX O
board O
: O
it O
fit O
in O
both O
. O

I O
did O
buy O
it O
after O
my O
smaller O
converter O
heated O
up O
like O
a O
toaster O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Vietnam O
and O
often O
worried O
me O
. O

For O
me O
this O
laptop O
was O
an O
important O
upgrade O
from O
my O
relatively O
old O
13 O
" O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

This O
replacement O
showed O
up O
in O
a O
plain O
white O
OEM O
box O
with O
no O
documentation O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
gon O
na O
be O
too O
nit O
picky O
about O
the O
looks O
and O
the O
magnesium O
finish O

, O
it O
's O
fairly O
thin O
, O
fairly O
powerful O
and O
portable O
. O

Love O
this O
laptop O

But O
with O
all O
the O
things O
that O
I O
have O
ordered O
on O
Amazon O
, O
this O
has O
never O
happened O
to O
have O
to O
send O
something O
back O
to O
a O
seller O
. O

This O
sleeve O
is O
attractive O
, O
well O
made O
and O
of O
quality O
material O
. O

Outside O
, O
there O
are O
three O
vertical O
pockets O
and O
a O
larger O
pocket O
. O

It O
has O
good O
sound O
, O
full O
volume O
seemed O
to O
work O
fine O
, O
maybe O
a O
little O
raspy O
, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
mp3 O
recording O
I O
was O
listening O
to O
may O
have O
caused O
the O
issue O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
speakers O
that O
size O
in O
hand O
- O
held O
transistor O
radios O
. O

Its O
quiet O
and O
hardly O
affects O
battery O
time O
. O

I O
sometimes O
keep O
it O
open O
at O
home O
in O
order O
to O
check O
my O
email O
while O
I O
'm O
working O
on O
my O
computer O
. O

I O
think O
if O
you O
only O
plan O
on O
having O
ONE O
tablet O
go O
with O
the O
500 O
t O
( O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
doing O
my O
daily O
new O
york O
times O
reading O
on O
the O
couch O
with O
the O
honker O
of O
a O
tablet O
in O
my O
hand O
) O

It O
works O
ok O
in O
a O
D O
- O
Dock O
too O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
set O
it O
4 O
times O
and O
always O
one O
side O
of O
de O
screen O
lacks O
to O
properly O
secure O
the O
cover O
. O

The O
range O
of O
the O
speaker O
is O
about O
30 O
feet O
( O
approximately O
10 O
meters O
) O
. O

Seems O
to O
charge O
fine O
and O
hold O
a O
long O
charge O
. O

Sick O
Deal.*Edit**5 O
months O
after O

, O
used O
about O
4 O
- O
5 O
times O
total O
and O
gently O
used O
, O
this O
chord O
stopped O
working O

This O
means O
that O
those O

should O
n't O
have O
any O

Very O
disappointed O
with O
Amazon O
who O
lowered O
the O
price O
$ O
100 O
the O
day O
after O
I O
bought O
and O
shipped O
me O
the O
more O
expensive O
product O
. O

Great O

great O

very O
reliable O

works O
well O
for O
me O
( O

and O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
. O

e. O
something O
I O
can O
use O
without O
paying O
a O
monthly O
subscription O
- O
and O
this O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
've O
written O
positive O
reviews O
of O
the O
Ultrabooks O
I O
own O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Dell O
Latitude O
running O
Window O
NT O
. O

The O
computer O
fan O
used O
to O
turn O
on O
at O
high O
speed O
and O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
unberable O
noise O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
backpack O
along O
with O
the O
Targus O
Drifter O
II O
Backpack O
to O
compare O
. O

This O
USB O
to O
Ethernet O
adaptor O
only O
needs O
drivers O
if O
you O
're O
on O
a O
mac O
or O
PC O
. O

It O
's O
put O
together O
well O
and O
looks O
professional O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
this O
. O

As O
I O
said O
before O
, O
this O
review O
is O
aimed O
towards O
casual O
users O
/ O
college O
users O
like O
myself O
that O
'll O
only O
use O
it O
for O
research O
, O
work O
that O
can O
be O
done O
on O
a O

( O
I O
had O
to O

from O

but O
was O
very O
simple O
) O

These O
are O
a O
great O
value O
and O
work O
great O
. O

The O
replacement O
is O
fine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
if O
it O
would O
work O
for O
that O
for O
I O
have O
n't O
tried O
it O
out O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
tv O
with O
s O
- O
video O
or O
component O
anymore O
. O

Online O
forums O
indicate O
that O
when O
you O
download O
HP O
BIOS O
updates O
, O
it O
can O
cut O
off O
your O
sound O
. O

This O
is O
really O
emabarrasing O
that O
a O
company O
puts O
out O
a O
pc O
with O
this O
type O
of O
hyper O
sensitivity O
in O
the O
mouse O
pad O
. O

If O
you O
do O
buy O
this O
item O
, O
one O
of O
the O
first O
things O
you O
should O
do O
is O
to O
check O
the O
support O
site O
and O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
at O
the O
latest O
BIOS O
. O

No O
more O
" O
closed O
" O
Apple O
nonsense O
that O
is O
only O
closed O
to O
force O
you O
to O
use O
iTune$.That O
said O
, O
Android O
is O
n't O
fully O
realized O
and O
is O
still O
being O
fleshed O
out O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
mediocre O
, O
but O
the O
trackpad O
is O
very O
good O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
make O
sure O
the O
projection O
screen O
is O
white O
and O
free O
of O
clutter O
, O
and O
the O
lights O
are O
off O
or O
suitably O
darkened O
, O
but O
at O
about O
7 O
feet O
it O
projected O
a O
nice O
, O
bright O
screen O
with O
good O
, O
vibrant O
colors O
, O
and O
clarity O
. O

It O
is O
the O
pad O
under O
the O
thumb O
on O
you O
hand O
. O

Light O
, O
portable O
charging O
cable O
. O

i O
never O
thought O
i O
would O
go O
with O
macs O
but O
as O
they O
say O
once O
you O
go O
mac O
you O
never O
go O
backand O
the O
fact O
you O
can O
runs O
windows O
on O
macs O
makes O
it O
more O
perfect O
. O

Based O
on O
my O
highly O
informal O
test O
, O
it O
's O
more O
like O
USB O
1 O
speeds O
. O

Do O
check O
the O
dimensions O
before O
ordering O
. O

Do O
not O
make O
a O
purchase O
from O
ABX O
ProTECH O
. O

Very O
useful O
when O
transmitting O
photos O
from O
Laptop O
to O
my O
phone O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
iPhone O
and O
the O
new O
ipods O
do O
NOT O
fit O
in O
it O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
try O
to O
work O
with O
that O
one O
on O
your O
own O
conscience O
. O

and O
I O
can O
just O
lay O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
without O
any O
uncomfortable O
heat O
building O
up O
. O

The O
blue O
connector O
stands O
out O
easily O
on O
the O
back O
of O
my O
computer O
amidst O
all O
the O
other O
cords O
so O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
. O

Surprisingly O
it O
worked O
well O
as O
an O
FM O
antenna O
. O

I O
got O
my O
Husband O
to O
open O
the O
cord O
, O
fix O
the O
wires O
, O
and O
tape O
it O
up O
with O
electrical O
tape O
. O

I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
allows O
me O
to O
" O
integrate O
" O
my O
mobile O
phone O
into O
my O
home O

Either O
way O
, O
the O
pack O
has O
been O
a O
great O
plus O
for O
me O
and O
has O
been O
loaned O
out O
to O
friends O
for O
many O
of O
their O
trips O
as O
well O
. O

In O
Win O
7 O
if O
you O
select O
" O
Open O
" O
after O
right O
clicking O
in O
the O
system O
tray O
rather O
than O
using O
the O
properties O
you O
can O
change O
the O
analog O
out O
to O
settings O
beyond O

Granted O
they O
can O
not O
compete O
with O
my O
Ohm O
home O
stereo O
speakers O
but O
unless O
you O
have O
that O
high O
a O
quality O
requirement O

Typical O
console O
cable O
. O

I O
was O
excited O
to O
try O
migrating O
using O
Norton O
Ghost O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
my O
existing O
drive O
was O
damaged O
beyond O
readability O
and O
therefore O
the O
Ghost O
backup O
repeatedly O
failed O
. O

Only O
the O
area O
right O
around O
the O
vent O
on O
the O
left O
side O
gets O
hot O
, O
the O
keyboard O
, O
palm O
rest O
, O
and O
touchpad O
never O
get O
uncomfortable O
. O

Great O
product O
! O

All O
- O
in O
- O
all O
, O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
case O
. O

The O
cable O
locks O
in O
extremely O
well O

It O
's O
certainly O
soft O
enough O
to O
be O
an O
impromptu O
pillow O
. O

Not O
much O
to O
review O
... O

This O
netbook O
goes O
everywhere O
with O
me O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
resist O
. O

This O
led O
me O
to O
go O
find O
my O
own O
random O
webcam O
software O
on O
the O
CNET O
Download O
website O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
it O
or O
any O
other O
ACER O
.. O

Maybe O
should O
come O
with O
2 O
USB O
cables O
for O
the O
tower O
! O

A O
few O
weeks O
later O
, O
dropped O
in O
price O
and O
came O
with O
a O
monitor O
at O
a O
local O
store O
, O
confound O
it O
! O

Now O
, O
one O
bounce O
, O
and O
it O
opens O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
as O
fast O
as O
a O
high O
- O
powered O
Mac O
. O

It O
was O
that O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
. O

it O
wo O
n't O
help O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

The O
only O
issue O
that O
someone O
might O
have O
is O
there O
are O
light O
spots O
on O
the O
top O
and O
bottom O
of O
the O
screen O
when O
viewing O
a O
blank O
screen O
( O
power O
on O
) O
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
noticeable O
when O
a O
picture O
is O
being O
displayed O
. O

Sure O
, O
no O
problem O
, O
ship O
it O
back O
at O
your O
cost O
and O
we O
'll O
send O
you O
an O
equally O
crummy O
replacement O
! O

It O
has O
a O
way O
to O
adjust O
the O
aspect O
ratio O
. O

Customer O
service O
is O
great O
and O
whatever O
delivery O
date O
Amazon O
populates O
, O
it O
is O
not O
real O
. O

One O
other O
note O
: O
I O
have O
been O
carrying O
around O
the O
Ogio O
Squadron O
RSS O
II O
Backpack O
and O
have O
enjoyed O
it O
. O

There O
ABSOLUTELY O
NO O
COMPARISION O
TO O
THE O
APPLE O
ITOUCH O
SCREEN O
! O

The O
cable O
has O
two O
different O
ends O
. O

The O
volume O
is O
quite O
adequate O
for O
a O
rather O
large O
room O
. O

I O
'm O
an O
advanced O
computer O
user O
who O
does O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
with O
computers O
, O

The O
Bamboo O
Fun O
comes O
packaged O
almost O
like O
a O
Macbook O
or O
iPhone O
or O
iPod O
, O
just O
as O
pleasant O
and O
fun O
to O
open O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
replacement O
charger O
for O
my O
Compaq O
laptop O
. O

so O
it O
might O
be O
a O
little O
better O
if O
I O
was O
listening O
to O
music O
. O

They O
have O
a O
nice O
heavy O
feel O
indicative O
of O
high O
quality O
cables O
, O
are O
nice O
and O
flexible O
and O
do O
n't O
kink O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
put O
on O
, O
but O
looking O
like O
it O
will O
be O
a O
pain O
to O
take O
off O
. O

Cheers O
& O
happy O
hunting O
! O

He O
discussed O
the O

I O
also O
found O
the O

The O
hard O

still O
working O
very O
well O
.. O

Again O
, O
that O
's O
not O

but O
if O
you O
're O
deciding O
between O
this O
fully O
featured O
version O
and O
the O
Atom O
processor O
version O
, O
you O
're O
probably O
doing O
so O
for O
price O
or O
battery O
. O

The O
fan O
worked O
very O
well O
and O
kept O
the O
laptop O
cool O
. O

The O
Micro O
comes O
with O
a O
small O
key O

at O
least O
, O
which O
I O
doubt O
would O
fit O
the O

Truth O
is O
I O
have O
a O
10 O

; O
Samsung O
netbook O
which O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
big O
to O
fit O
inside O
it O

The O
keyboard O
is O
an O
exact O
replacement O
for O
the O
keyboard O
for O
the O
Acer O
Aspire O
5552 O
Model O
5495 O
. O

It O
adapts O
to O
the O
tablet O
without O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
the O
keys O
are O
a O
little O
flat O
to O
the O
touch O
, O
so O
if O
speed O
is O
what O
you O
want O
while O
typing O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
amplify O
my O
tablet O
's O
GPS O
navigation O
audio O
output O
in O
my O
car O
, O
as O
the O
built O
- O
in O
tablet O
audio O
is O
not O
loud O
enough O
in O
a O
vehicle O
with O
lots O
of O
noise O
. O

I O
hope O
my O
review O
helps O
someone O
out O
there O
. O

Delivery O
on O
time O
and O
good O
service O
. O

If O
you O
're O
thinking O
about O
it O
take O
a O
chance O

I O
got O
this O
as O
a O
free O
add O
on O
to O
an O
order O
. O

I O
had O
my O
doubts O
when O
I O
ordered O
this O
, O
but O
because O
of O
the O
positive O
reviews O
I O
ordered O
it O
anyway O
. O

When O
I O
first O
ordered O
it O
I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
I O
did O
so O
a O
bit O
reluctantly O
because O
I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
whether O
the O
quality O
was O
going O
to O
be O
descent O
or O
not O

The O
CityGear O
TCG400 O
case O
is O
a O
staple O
in O
my O
collection O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
screen O
is O
way O
too O
small O
and O
the O
case O
too O
cheap O
looking O
. O

it O
's O
still O
a O
good O
replacement O
though O

It O
could O
be O
a O
bit O
faster O
on O
boot O

The O
upside O
is O
that O
I O
replaced O
the O
HDD O
with O
a O
WD O
Scorpio O
WD7500BPKT O
750 O
GB O
7200 O

Like O
others O
, O
my O
disk O
drives O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
CD O
disk O
. O

They O
are O
quite O
neutral O
( O
or O
" O
flat O
" O
- O
it O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
) O
from O
the O
upper O
bass O
to O
the O
lower O
treble O
. O

I O
honestly O
feel O
this O
computer O
simply O
has O
a O
ghost O
that O
is O
impossible O
to O
find O
& O
fix O
..... O

The O
second O
issue O
is O
with O
burning O
DVD O
's O
and O
CD O
's O
. O

It O
's O
lighter O
, O
it O
boots O
up O
faster O
and O
runs O
cooler O
but O
it O
also O
has O
it O
's O
limitations O
when O
compared O
to O
a O
typical O
microsoft O
laptop O
. O

Bought O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
2 O
year O
old O
Dell O
XPS O
M1330 O
after O
the O
6-cell O
Dell O
battery O
died O
( O
would O
not O
hold O
a O
charge O
) O
. O

I O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
cheaper O
, O
generic O
item O

- O
Clamshell O
Wireless O
Bluetooth O
iPad O
Mini O
Keyboardcase O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
attach O
onto O
my O
iPad O
mini O
and O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

It O
shuts O
itself O
off O
automatically O
when O
not O
in O
use O
to O
save O
battery O
life O
, O
which O
is O
something O
I O
wish O
my O
much O
more O
expensive O
mouse O
would O
do O
. O

A O
high O
gain O
antenna O
will O
give O
exceptional O
reception O
. O

No O
control O
over O
treble O
or O
bass O
, O
just O
different O
EQ O
settings O
, O
which O
really O
did O
n't O
help O
. O

The O
second O
time O
, O
I O
junked O
it O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
bother O
with O
the O
CD O
because O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
the O
device O
installed O
and O
hooked O
right O
up O
to O
my O
home O
wifi- O
and O
does O
n't O
disconnect O
like O
the O
other O
ones O
I O
bought O
. O

This O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
OEM O
, O
but O
acceptable O
given O
the O
price O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
first O
talk O
about O
the O
" O
blinking O
lights O
" O
since O
the O
only O
other O
reviewer O
that O
has O
a O
review O
for O
this O
product O
gave O
the O
device O
1 O
star O
because O
of O
the O
lights O
. O

The O
thickness O
of O
the O
plastic O
on O
that O
part O
of O
the O
case O
is O
just O
enough O
to O
keep O
the O
mag O
- O
safe O
connectors O
from O
aligning O
properly O
with O
the O
cable O
toward O
the O
back O
. O

If O
you O
can O
even O
find O
these O
parts O
-- O
I O
have O
n't O
yet O
been O
able O
to O

The O
Logitech O
software O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
-- O
just O
download O
the O
latest O
version O
from O
the O
company O
website O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
recommend O
buying O
this O

Unfortunately O
the O
unit O
was O
transshipped O
to O
me O
in O
the O
Caribbean O
and O
would O
cost O
more O
to O
return O
than O
to O
purchase O
another O
one O
. O

Bought O
this O
product O
from O
Amazon O
and O
received O
within O
3 O
days O
. O

The O
only O
slight O
negative O
, O
for O
myself O
, O
is O
the O
grey O
/ O
green O
colored O
one O
. O

this O
is O
a O
good O
keyboard O
, O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
, O
very O
slim O
and O
works O
fine O
, O
there O
is O
a O
slight O
delay O
when O
you O
are O
typing O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
times O
i O
miss O
a O
letter O
that O
does O
not O
show O
up O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
start O
of O
typing O
, O
but O
overall O
its O
a O
great O
value O
and O
a O
good O
keyboard O
for O
my O
ipad O
4 O

I O
have O
not O
checked O
the O
actual O
voltage O
under O
load O
, O
nor O
maxed O
it O
out O
yet O
, O
nor O
have O
any O
idea O
how O
long O
it O
will O
continue O
to O
operate O
, O
but O
this O
unit O
does O
give O
me O
the O
capability O
to O
live O
completely O
off O
the O
grid O
, O
and O
to O
use O
my O
solar O
excess O
where O
as O
before O
I O
had O
to O
use O
the O
grid O
to O
power O
the O
chargers O
which O
might O
protest O
the O
modified O
square O
wave O
inverterIt O
comes O
in O
a O
hard O
to O
open O
blister O
pack O
, O
and O
this O
was O
kind O
of O
loose O
in O
the O
Amazon O
box O
and O
flopping O
around O
inside O
of O
it O
. O

It O
sits O
flat O
on O
top O
of O
the O
PC O
which O
is O
great O
, O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
falling O
over O
. O

Items O
that O
were O
absent O
from O
the O
" O
What O
's O
in O
the O
box O
" O
include O
a O
VGA O
Adapter O
and O
a O
USB O
- O

Ethernet O
Adapter O
. O

And O
where O
do O
you O
find O
drivers O
for O
things O
that O
have O
no O
brand O
name O
? O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
mouse O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
cuz O
my O
office O
tends O
to O
get O
a O
little O
warm O
& O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
outlets O
at O
desk O
level O
. O

Although O
I O
do O
think O
Corsair O
make O
great O
PSU O
's O
hence O
the O
3 O
stars O
. O

This O
is O
a O
must O
have O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
I O
ordered O
this O
... O

It O
has O
HDMI O
, O
standard O
monitor O
port O
, O
and O
Ethernet O
; O
built O

in O

but O
the O
Comcast O
HD O
movies O
look O
great O
! O

My O
background O
pictures O
look O
nice O
on O
it O
, O
but O
not O
close O
to O
what O
they O
look O
like O
on O
my O
Helix O
. O

they O
have O
the O
worst O
customer O
service O
. O

We O
have O
a O
huge O
fire O
burning O
here O
in O
So O
. O

This O
one O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
static O
- O
y O
when O
driving O
through O
different O
areas O
but O
it O
works O
well O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
good O
area O
and O
find O
a O
good O
station O
to O
use O
. O

Some O
reviews O
may O
have O
been O
written O
with O
an O
earlier O
version O
of O
the O
Mont O
Blanc O
. O

Impressively O
, O
the O
scroll O
wheel O
has O
remained O
smooth O
even O
after O
years O
of O
using O
the O
mouse O
intensively O
( O
hours O
a O
day O
) O
. O

Based O
on O
that O
experience O
, O
and O
if O
my O
laptop O
was O
a O
much O
newer O
laptop O
, O
or O
I O
was O
intending O
to O
keep O
it O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
more O
years O
, O
I O
would O
have O
definitely O
gone O
with O
the O
Anker O
without O
question O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
that O
many O
LEDs O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
this O
thing O
is O
plugged O
in O
. O

I O
hate O
this O
worthless O
paperweight O
. O

but O
here O
's O
my O
two O
cents O
. O

Wifi O
on O
mine O
is O
n't O
that O
bad O
( O
actually O
pretty O
comparable O
to O
my O
dell O
laptop O
) O
, O
and O
i O
think O
most O
of O
the O
older O
versions O
might O
be O
the O
ones O
with O
the O
wifi O
issue O
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
really O
a O
problem O
now O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
access O
and O
play O
both O
audio O
and O
video O
content O
from O
the O
NAS O
to O
two O
computers O
wirelessly O
accessing O
my O
network O
. O

Now O
, O
to O
put O
this O
in O
perspective O
, O
this O
3DMark06 O
score O
is O
only O
about O
half O
that O
of O
my O
4-year O
old O
desktop O
Geforce O
8800GT O
and O
one O
third O
of O
my O
2-year O
old O
Geforce O
GTX280 O
. O

Something O
I O
can O
toss O
in O
my O
pocket O
with O
change O
or O
keys O
and O
not O
worry O
about O
. O

So O
far O
its O
held O
up O
well O
and O
for O
the O
price O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
better O
option O
. O

I O
guess O
that O
fuzzy O
fabric O
is O
called O
" O
nylex".Along O
the O
back O
outside O
near O
the O
handles O
is O
a O
small O
zippered O
pocket O
that O
is O
6 O
inches O
wide O
and O
5 O
inches O
deep O
, O
lined O
with O
the O
fuzzy O
material O
( O
would O
be O
good O
place O
for O
a O
phone O
or O
Ipod O
) O
. O

Bottom O
Line O
: O

Arrived O
quickly O
and O
packaged O
well O
. O

We O
had O
real O
leather O
bags O
that O
looked O
real O
bad O
in O
6 O
months O
, O
ripping O
apart O
and O
handles O
cracking O
. O

Will O
recommend O
to O
those O
with O
Mac O
notebooks O
! O
! O
! O

The O
item O
syncs O
easily O
and O
feels O
like O
a O
keyboard O
, O
letters O
are O
raised O
unlike O
some O
keyboards O
that O
have O
flat O
letters O
. O

THIS O
COMPUTERIt O
is O
my O
first O
and O
last O
experience O
with O
a O
Toshiba O
. O

As O
for O
the O
durability O
, O
I O
suspect O
this O
cord O
is O
very O
susceptible O
to O
damage O
near O
the O
place O
where O
it O
connects O
to O
the O
laptop O
's O
AC O
jack O
- O
with O
all O
the O
added O
weight O
hanging O
on O
it O
you O
have O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
not O
to O
damage O
the O
cord O
or O
the O
jack O
itself O
. O

But O
watching O
movie O
at O
low O
power O
mode O
itself O
is O
perfectly O
smooth O
. O

Although O
the O
Dell O
is O
really O
nice O
too O
, O
there O
are O
two O
major O
weaknesses O
- O
the O
first O
depends O
on O
your O
budget:1 O
. O

Since O
battery O
can O
not O
be O
removed O
, O
buying O
an O
extended O
or O
additional O
battery O
is O
n't O
likely O
. O

The O
speaker&#8217;s O
frequency O
response O
is O

Works O
great O
and O
made O
our O
daughter O
happy O

Thus O
the O
three O

rating O
! O

I O
have O
been O
using O
the O
speakers O
to O
listen O
to O

while O
I O
work O
and O
it O
is O
fantastic O
! O

Have O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
a O
whole O
new O
motherboard O
, O
or O
so O
they O
tell O
me O
. O

Now O
I O
can O
record O
ANY O

stream O

all O
on O
my O

" O
Sharp O

on O
my O
home O

It O
fits O
perfectly O
and O
requires O
no O
modification O
. O

But O
a O
little O
after O
5 O
months O
you O
can O
see O
it O
start O
to O
crack O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
you O
have O
any O
concern O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
if O
you O
can O
special O
order O
from O
Apple O
online O
, O
or O
in O
many O
situations O
, O
you O
will O
find O
the O
standard O
hard O
drive O
to O
be O
acceptable O
. O

Then O
to O
my O
horror O
, O
I O
realized O
that O
there O
were O
no O
smudge O
to O
wipe O
off O
. O

For O
similar O
audio O
quality O
to O
a O
Big O

at O
less O

I O
can O
only O
conclude O
the O

more O
than O
one O

there O
is O
no O

own O

now O
leave O

I O
will O

create O

after O

the O

did O
n't O
work O
regardless O
of O
which O
method O
I O
used O

We O
purchased O
this O

based O
on O

and O
our O
needs O
, O
and O
have O
not O
been O
let O
down O
by O
it O

performance O
at O
all O
. O

Also O
tried O
a O
full O
size O

( O
excellent O
as O
always O

too O
big O
to O
carry O
) O
and O
a O

mouse O
( O
sucks O
like O
all O
mice O
but O
usable O
if O
a O
mouse O
is O
your O
idea O
of O
a O
good O
time O
. O

I O
still O
have O
mine O
on O
, O
but O
I O
do O
wish O
I O
still O
had O
that O
nice O
clear O
screen O
again O
, O
so O
I O
may O
end O
up O
taking O
it O
off O
at O
some O
point O
. O

the O
design O
is O
somehow O
weird O
! O

Keys O
stick O
and O
some O
just O
do O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
... O

It O
allows O
the O
phone O
to O
charge O
quickly O
, O
and O
the O
cord O
is O
heavy O
duty O
and O
durable O
. O

Its O
my O
best O
friend O
. O

to O
wake O
it O
back O
up O
, O
just O
tap O
the O
keyboard O
three O
or O
four O
times O
, O
and O
it O
reconnects O
immediately O
. O

It O
worked O
for O
it O
's O
basic O
purpose O
... O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
more O
than O
4 O
months O
IF O
that O
before O
TWO O
of O
them O
had O
to O
be O

Good O
computer O
to O
consider O
. O

Plugs O

and O
works O
fine O
, O
tho O
so O
far O
, O
it O
seems O
it O

a O
Perfect O
way O

changing O

something O

I O
should O
have O
followed O

returned O
the O

I O
do O

We O
then O
get O
this O

because O
my O

really O
likes O
the O

It O

and O
I O

the O

your O

was O
how O
close O

so O
I O
could O
have O

to O

to O
order O

it O
would O

the O

is O
so O

think O

used O
one O

I O
took O
out O
of O

, O
I O

it O

I O
do O

I O

Both O

are O

very O

they O

with O

I O

also O
going O

around O

Also O
used O
with O
cheap O

This O

's O
way O
better O
than O
my O
old O
one O
, O

Not O
much O
to O
say O
other O
than O
it O
works O
. O

If O
you O
need O
vga O
into O

for O
this O

, O
this O
is O
the O
unit O
. O

And O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
these O
speakers O
to O
me O
sound O
BETTER O
than O
Bose O
. O

Lynksys O
stuff O
breaks O
, O

and O
mis O

And O
, O
YES O
, O
I O
now O
see O
around O
20 O

25 O
of O
my O
neighbors O
wifi O
signals O
, O
whereas O
before O
I O
would O
see O
only O
3 O
or O
4 O
of O
them O
very O
weakly O
. O

Bought O
one O
of O
these O
for O
my O
1000HE O
found O
out O
too O
late O
that O
it O
will O
not O
charge O
your O
battery O
at O
all O
and O
will O
barely O
keep O
up O
powering O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
ve O
used O
a O
Chromebook O
as O
my O
main O
laptop O
for O
a O
half O
- O
year O
stretch O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
is O
pretty O
much O
& O
# O
34;plug O
and O
play&#34 O
; O
after O
you O
install O
the O
drivers O
via O
the O
given O
CD O
. O

I O
could O
have O
taken O
a O
chance O
with O
a O
slightly O
smaller O
bag O
, O
but O
I O
prefer O
that O
it O
be O
a O
big O
too O
big O

I O
love O
the O
14 O
in O
model O
. O

I O
am O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
this O
type O
of O
bag O
as O
a O
working O
bag O
- O
rugged O
construction O
but O
minimal O
padding O
. O

The O
Tamarac O
Expedition O
7 O
REALLY O
delivers O
in O
this O
area O
. O

I O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
different O
phone O
and O
it O
worked O
. O

Pretty O
cheap O
product O
as O
well O
, O
does O
not O
feel O
very O
solid O
. O

They O
asked O
me O
to O
call O
Samsung O
with O
a O
number O
they O
provided O
so O
I O
did O
. O

Worked O
well O
at O
first O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
months O
it O
stopped O
recharging/ O

Clear O
and O
easy O
to O
understand O
instructions O
were O
included O
in O
hardcopy O
and O
are O
displayed O
on O
the O
TV O
prior O
to O
connect O
. O

The O
DVD O
player O
is O
only O
a O
1080i O
- O

This O
eliminates O
the O
" O
bowing O
" O
and O
thus O
makes O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
case O
fit O
better O
than O
Speck O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
from O
iPhone O
or O
iPad O
is O
thin O
and O
hollow O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
surprising O
from O
a O
low O
- O
end O
speaker O
. O

I O
'll O
probably O
try O
another O
brand O
when O
I O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
. O

I O
did O
manage O
to O
create O
a O
profile O
typing O
the O
WPA2 O
key O
by O
hand O
and O
that O
worked O
. O

The O
thing O
I O
do O
like O
, O
is O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
folding O
up O
and O
crushing O
my O
fingers O
like O
on O
my O
old O
lap O
stand O
. O

I O
do O
own O
headphones O
for O
which O
I O
've O
paid O
over O
$ O
500 O
, O
and O
which O
definitely O
need O
amps O
. O

I O
have O
an O
iPod O
touch O
docked O
and O
my O
computer O
plugged O
in O
at O
the O
same O
time O
- O
and O
they O
both O
work O
fine O
. O

it O

but O
I O
have O
n't O
received O
it O
yet O
? O

Plus O
at O
my O
desk O
I O
can O
drop O
the O
power O
supply O
behind O
and O
underneath O
and O
reduce O
cord O
clutter O
. O

I O
used O
this O
laptop O
quite O
a O
lot O
over O
a O
period O
of O
2 O
years O
. O

It O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
after O
I O
downloaded O
the O

. O

Windows O

starter O
loads O
quickly O
and O
has O
just O
about O
all O
the O
features O
you O
need O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
great O
! O

Too O
bad O
Lenovo O
did O
n't O
keep O
AF O
adapter O
same O
or O
provide O
easier O
adapter O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
just O
is O
n't O
meant O
to O
go O
anywhere O

This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
products O
that O
looks O
like O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
during O
the O
design O
stage O
. O

If O
you O
are O
considering O
a O
NAS O
box O
that O
simply O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
, O
without O
investing O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
effort O
learning O
the O
ropes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O
for O
you O
. O

I O
will O
however O
complain O
about O
the O
size O
. O

LAPTOP O

stuck O
it O
in O
the O
slot O
, O
recognized O
and O
works O
! O

I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
ever O
since O
the O
new O
iMac O
and O
Macbook O
Pro O
came O
out O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
stop O
thinking O
about O
it O
. O

The O
treble O
and O
bass O
pop O
up O
on O
the O
screen O
, O
the O
screen O
crashes O
and O
recovers O
and O
customer O
service O
and O
I O
have O
a O
great O
relationship O
of O
reviewing O
all O
the O
times O
it O
has O
been O
returned O
to O
them O
for O
repair O
. O

After O
trying O
it O
with O
ever O
laptop O
and O
desktop O
in O
the O
house O
( O
with O
3 O
different O
operating O
systems O
) O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

would O
be O
improved O
if O
the O
2 O
screws O
to O
lock O
on O
to O
projectors O
were O
to O
be O
really O
bolt O
on O
rather O
than O
fall O
loose O
. O

This O
comment O
is O
a O
bonus O
" O
WTF O
" O
from O
when O
they O
switched O
years O
ago O
... O
finally O
venting O
my O
opinion O
. O

Let O
me O
use O
it O
! O

It O
ended O
up O
being O
really O
handy O
because O
my O
laptop O
died O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
see O
anything O
on O
my O
netbook O
is O
difficult O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
how O
well O
it O
integrates O
with O
with O
my O
iPhone O
and O
iPad O
for O
better O
accuracy O
, O
the O
App O
provides O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
information O
for O
a O
techie O
like O
me O
. O

The O
desktop O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
wireless O
card O
and O
our O
router O
is O
across O
the O
room O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
an O
ugly O
cord O
going O
across O
our O
floor O
. O

If O
you O
create O
a O
master O
password O
or O
an O
hard O
disk O
password O
, O
do O
no O
forget O
them O
! O
! O
! O

Due O
to O
the O
USB O
input O
, O
in O
a O
pinch O
, O
I O
could O
even O
use O
it O
on O
my O
full O
sized O
notebook O
or O
PC O
if O
I O
wanted O
. O

Bought O
a O
non O
- O
Dell O
adapter O
and O
it O
went O
bad O
within O
a O
month O
. O

Good O
price O
, O
too O
. O

I O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
look O
it O
over O
last O
time O
we O
met O
, O
and O
it O
has O
not O
changed O
for O
the O
worse O
. O

Toshiba O

:/ O
& O

It O
has O
the O
perfect O
amount O
of O
storage O
for O
travel O
in O
a O
durable O
lightweight O
package O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
secure O
way O
to O
do O
that O
. O

After O
my O
HP O
Pavilion O
Elite O
get O
's O
out O
of O
date O
, O
I O
am O
never O
purchasing O
another O
HP O
or O
Compaq O

. O

That O
position O
allows O
easy O
reach O
to O
all O
dv7 O
keys O
except O
the O
top O
two O
rows O
. O

Been O
using O
this O
on O
a O
Lenovo O
Thinkpad O
e530 O
with O
no O
problems O
whatsoever O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
TV O
so O
it O
sounds O
like O
you O
're O
listening O
thru O
a O
filter O
. O

Was O
to O
cheap O
of O

to O
send O

; O
, O
so O
far O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
, O
fair O
product O
for O
the O
price O
. O

With O
that O
said O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O

but O
maybe O
be O
cautious O
of O
this O

This O
product O
may O
work O
fine O
for O
MacBooks O
but O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
if O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
improve O
the O
sound O
on O
an O
iMac O

and O
it O
seems O
good O
enough O
to O
FF O

I O
had O
an O

close O
to O

and O
I O
have O
not O
been O

I O
love O
this O

and O

which O
is O
really O

only O
said O
to O

up O

but O
I O
figured O
with O
a O
fresh O
Windows O

bit O
that O
I O
could O
push O
the O
limit O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

So O
far O
this O
device O
has O
allowed O
me O
to O
do O
that O
without O
any O
hiccups O
and O
at O
great O
speeds O
. O

So O
, O
I O
thought O
the O
Notebook O
Cooler O
might O
do O
the O
trick O
. O

( O
e. O

. O

I O
cleaned O
the O
screen O
with O
the O
enclosed O
cloth O
and O
peeled O
off O
the O
first O
inch O
of O
the O
release O
paper O
. O

This O
is O
one O
beautiful O
laptop O

and O
it O
worth O
every O
penny O
that O
you O

I O
played O
with O
the O
Aspire O

at O
the O
store O
for O
a O
while O
and O
could O
not O
get O
used O
to O
the O

configuration O
which O
I O
found O
extremely O
frustrating O
to O
use O

I O
was O
worried O
about O
a O
product O
that O
claimed O
to O
charge O
so O
many O
different O
electronic O
items O
that O
use O
any O
number O
of O
cells O
in O
the O
pack O
to O
arrive O
at O
various O
working O

, O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
have O
that O
covered O
. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
pockets O
for O
misc O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
pretty O
picky O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
video O
cameras O
, O
so O
that O
's O
saying O
a O
lot O
. O

The O
adapter O
is O
very O
sturdy O
and O
has O
gold O
contacts O
too O
. O

The O
documentation O
on O
the O
Internet O
for O
replacing O
the O
fan O
is O
quite O
good O
. O

so O
it O
's O
not O
a O
device O
's O
problem O
. O

anyway O
even O
with O
the O
pocket O

will O
simply O
not O
fit O

I O
was O
putting O
a O
fairly O
old O
laptop O
into O
service O
which O
only O
came O
with O
256 O
mb O
of O
RAM O
. O

Overall O
this O
case O
is O
okay O
but O
expensive O
for O
a O
piece O
of O
plastic O

Feels O
fragile O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
SanDisk O
knows O
better O
on O
making O
it O
sturdy O
. O

Pocket O
holds O
the O
charger O
and O
my O
wireless O
mouse O
. O

I O
would O
spend O
the O
extra O
$ O
10 O
and O
avoid O
the O
hassle O
. O

I O
think O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
that O
from O
Sandisk O
. O

He O
said O
if O
your O
budget O
would O
n't O
support O
paying O
hundreds O
of O
dollars O
, O
consider O
the O
GOgroove O
BlueSYNC O
. O

and O
it O
had O
some O
speakerphone O
and O
volume O
controls O
. O

Good O
price O
too O
! O

Now O
the O
adapter O
end O
is O
wiggling O
just O
like O
the O
original O

I O
'm O
a O
fan O
of O
all O
things O
3D O
, O
so O
I O
read O
a O
lot O
before O
buying O
this O
product O
. O

I O
read O
some O
of O
the O
comments O
on O
the O
speakers O
and O
they O
work O
very O
well O
. O

I O
had O
to O
do O
some O
repairs O
within O
a O
couple O
months O
, O
but O
nothing O
major O
. O

I O
plugged O
the O
Ankar O
charger O
in O
, O
and O
it O
immediately O
started O
charging O
the O
battery O
, O
which O
has O
stayed O
at O
100 O
% O
since O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
. O

i O
was O
like O
there O
s O
no O
way O
this O
can O
be O
very O
loud O
. O

jokeI O
have O
no O
hesitation O
giving O
this O
netbook O
4 O
stars O
, O
if O
it O
were O
not O
for O
the O
98 O
% O
useless O
speaker O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
5 O
. O

Wanted O
something O
to O
protect O
my O
new O
MacBook O
Air O
and O
something O
that O
looked O
nice O
; O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
how O
it O
would O
attach O
. O

If O
you O
broke O
a O
$ O
10 O
GMYLE O
, O

It O
does O
not O
open O
up O
and O
allow O
you O
to O
use O
your O
computer O
with O
the O
case O
attached O
, O
as O
some O
do O
. O

It O
took O
about O
15 O
minutes O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
and O
now O
the O
bass O
is O
noticeably O
tighter O
! O

It O
lasts O
longer O
than O
the O
manufactured O
battery O
. O

The O
pockets O
are O
very O
tight O
and O
I O
would O
only O
imagine O
putting O
just O
paper O
in O
there O
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
recommend O
it O
for O
kids O
. O

First O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
use O
to O
using O
a O
Chromebook O
, O
but O
it O
grows O
on O
you O
quickly O
. O

Every O
laptop O
should O
have O
this O
, O
it O
is O
amazing O
. O

The O
qsb O
's O
are O
thicker O
/ O
wider O
and O
the O
pioneers O
are O
taller O
. O

At O
$ O

with O
free O
shipping O
, O
my O
response O
is O
, O
" O
meh".It O
's O
a O
$ O
6 O
cordless O
mouse O
with O
free O
shipping O
. O

I O
would O
say O
I O
really O
liked O
it O

It O
worked O
great O
, O
even O
better O
than O
original O
. O

My O
Dell O
laptop O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
like O
Dell O
brand O
stuff O
, O
this O
thing O
died O
pretty O
much O
instantly O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
sometimes O
I O
have O
a O
terrible O
time O
finding O
where O
it O
put O
a O
file O
I O
was O
working O
on O
. O

The O
zipper O
pocket O
in O
the O
front O
provides O
enough O
room O
for O
me O
to O
the O
stash O
the O
charger O
as O
well O
as O
my O
Anywhere O
Mouse O
MX O
, O
and O
a O
nice O
little O
handle O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

but O
when O
I O
do O
I O
'll O
probably O
get O
another O
ASUS O
. O

On O
its O
320 O
GB O
hard O
drive O
, O
I O
have O
all O
my O
pictures O
, O
music O
and O
video O
files O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
never O
far O
away O
from O
entertainment O
. O

There O
are O
cons O
( O
life O
is O
pain O
, O
Highness O
) O
. O

Have O
been O
really O
happy O
since O
I O
bought O
this O
Chromebook O
. O

Also O
impressive O
was O
the O
e O
- O
mail O
I O
received O
from O
the O
company O
offering O
me O
any O
support O
with O
problems O
. O

The O
surface O
is O
very O
sticky O
, O
no O
way O
to O
use O
the O
Pogo O
stylus O
pen O
anymore O
. O

After O
reading O
another O
user O
's O
review O
, O
I O
realized O
this O
mouse O
is O
designed O
with O
storage O
space O
built O
in O
to O
hold O
the O
USB O
receiver O
. O

but O
there O
is O
for O
sure O
a O
good O
amount O
that O
have O
problems O
. O

The O
truth O
, O
I O
'm O
amazed O
by O
sound O
and O
clearity O
this O
mini O
speaker O
provides O
, O
works O
with O
any O
MP3 O
, O
cell O
phones O
, O
tablets O
, O

... O

Add O
power O
cable O
for O
the O

, O

the O

I O
store O
my O
unit O
in O
a O
small O
Case O
Logic O
bag O
that O
was O
meant O
for O
a O
handful O
of O
CDs O
to O
protect O
it O
and O
keep O
the O
AC O
cord O
and O
the O
battery O
cover O
from O
getting O
separated O
. O

Cons O
: O
Will O
not O
charge O
my O
phone O
. O

The O
speakers O
themselves O
have O
no O
volume O
control O
. O

I O
had O
my O
doubts O
, O
given O
the O
space O
between O
the O
laptop O
and O
the O
cooling O
pad O
. O

Obviously O
something O
's O
up O
; O
it O
took O
hardly O
45 O
seconds O
before O
. O

The O
memory O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
works O
as O
promised O
. O

A O
little O
trouble O
with O
drivers O
, O
but O
works O
as O
advertised O
once O
you O
get O
that O
straightened O
out O
. O

Finally O
a O
comment O
about O
the O
Mac O
platform O
. O

Initially O
designed O
for O
the O
Apple O
notebooks O
, O
LA O
robe O
is O
made O
in O
a O
soft O
, O
shape O
- O
memory O
material O
, O
ideal O
to O
dress O
your O
notebook O
in O
an O
original O
fashion O
while O
protecting O
it O
from O
mobile O
life O
worries O
. O

Apple O
has O
made O
the O
move O
to O
build O
- O
in O
the O
Lithium O
- O
ionbattery O
so O
when O
it O
fails O
you O
must O
return O
the O
entire O
Laptop O
for O
a O
replacement O
battery O
or O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
open O
the O
case O
and O
replace O
it O
myself O
. O

I O
HAVE O
EVER O
CALLED O

I O
wanted O
to O
like O
this O
and O
guess O
what O
? O

This O
is O
not O
a O
graphics O
, O
design O
, O
or O
media O
editing O
powerhouse O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
I O
had O
was O
that O
the O
case O
was O
stubborn O
to O
close O
and O
the O
snap O
tight O
closure O
catches O
seemed O
a O
little O
bit O
" O
IFFY O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
begin O
to O
describe O
all O
the O
issues O
this O
laptop O
has O
, O
but O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
worst O
problem O
. O

: O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
on O
my O
2nd O
unit O
. O

This O
transmitter O
has O
some O
good O
and O
bad O
points O
. O

Save O
yourself O
some O
hassle O
. O

Is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
still O
working O
fine O
. O

That O
's O
OK O
in O
my O
book O
.. O

atleast O
it O
should O
clean O
my O
lens O
. O

That O
's O
all O
I O
wanted O
it O
for O
and O
it O
kicked O
right O
in O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
plugged O
up O
my O
monitor O
. O

The O
extreme O
portability O
means O
I O
can O
type O
anywhere O
, O
the O
battery O
lasts O
longer O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
. O

It O
works O
great O
and O
also O
the O
mouse O
pad O
is O
compatible O
. O

First O
, O
the O
enclosure O
itself O
looks O
nice O
and O
feels O
pretty O
durable O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
the O
LEDs O
. O

I O
'll O
burn O
my O
laptop O
as O
fast O
as O
I O
please O
; O
thanks O
much O
. O

Powerful O
Wifi O
amplification O
! O

It O
looks O
and O
feels O
like O
it O
cost O
about O
.42 O
to O
make O
, O
but O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

This O
could O
possibly O
be O
just O
from O
the O
new O
plastic O
expanding O
a O
bit O
but O
its O
a O
hardly O
noticeable O
sound O
. O

It O
works O
perfect O
and O
no O
problems O
to O
report O
. O

; O
If O
you O
want O
big O
, O
you O
want O
this O
:-D O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
this O
keyboard O
/ O
mouse O
combo O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
very O
fair O
price O
. O

Worked O
right O
from O
installation O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
think O
Chromebooks O
and O
the O
Chrome O
OS O
have O
a O
bright O
future O
, O
and O
the O
latest O
generation O
of O
Chrome O
computers O
are O
a O
vast O
improvement O
over O
their O
predecessors O
. O

The O
placement O
of O
the O
buttons O
on O
the O
side O
, O
rather O
then O
below O
, O
is O
awkward O
. O

And O
the O
price O
was O
excellent O
. O

( O
I O
use O
LastPass O
and O
Trucrypt O
) O

Although O
it O
may O
work O
well O
for O
headphones O
or O
speakers O
, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
mention O
here O
that O
it O
seems O
not O
compatible O
with O
at O
least O
some O
Chrysler O
car O
radios O
. O

I O
have O
thought O
about O
ordering O
another O
one O
to O
have O
around O
if O
for O
some O
reason O
this O
one O
ever O
wears O
out O
. O

It O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
fixed O
my O
issue O
. O

I O
will O
be O
contacting O
Acer O
to O
see O
if O
there O
's O
a O
way O
to O
fix O
this O
problem O
. O

If O
the O
touchpad O
features O
worked O
as O
advertised O
, O
it O
would O
be O
great O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
it O
and O
it O
is O
a O
solid O
charger O
to O
use O
with O
the O
Raspberry O
Pi O
or O
any O
other O
devices O
using O
the O
Micro O
USB O
connection O
. O

Not O
so O
tech O
savy O
myself O
, O
I O
would O
have O
had O
some O
problems O
with O
connecting O
to O
our O
wireless O
network O
and O
printer O
, O
but O
thanks O
to O
my O
tech O
support O
daughter O
& O
husband O
, O
I O
am O
up O
& O
running O
and O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Win8 O
on O
the O
hard O
drive O

I O
was O
able O
to O

Sample O
provided O
for O
review O
. O

I O
am O
thrilled O
to O
have O
a O
functional O
keyboard O
again O
and O
delighted O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
bother O
family O
or O
friends O
with O
this O
. O

( O
Word O
, O
Excel O
, O
Access O
, O
Powerpoint O
, O
Outlook O
) O
and O
Visual O
Studio O
and O
they O
work O
great O
- O
no O
issues O
so O
far O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
long O
life O
battery O
to O
watch O
movies O
. O

The O
top O
has O
a O
subtle O
scratch O
, O
and O
the O
base O
of O
the O
case O
were O
sloppily O
put O
together O
. O

It O
works O
, O
good O
price O
fast O
shipment O
well O
packaged O
. O

With O
Windows O
you O
might O
have O
to O
reinstall O
the O
OS O
and O
each O
and O
every O
application O
. O

The O
little O
stylus O
is O
surprisingly O
capable O
for O
drawing O
, O
and O
the O
stock O
nib O
has O
a O
slightly O
softer O
tip O
, O
eliminating O
any O
clacking O
while O
taking O
notes O
in O
meetingsCONS:- O
Mostly O
with O
the O
software O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
to O
turn O
on O
and O
off O
and O
needed O
to O
have O
the O
reset O
button O
pushed O
quite O
often O
which O
means O
you O
need O
to O
have O
a O
small O
paper O
clip O
handy O
when O
using O
the O
unit O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
original O
Crysis O
, O
fully O
expecting O
it O
to O
fail O
as O
it O
is O
designed O
for O
XP O
/ O
Vista O
, O
but O
it O
worked O
great O
and O
the O
graphics O
were O
terrific O
and O
the O
laptop O
was O
silent O
( O
no O
loud O
fan O
noise O
) O
during O
the O
gameplay O
. O

If O
I O
'm O
hiking O
, O
bag O
further O
has O
a O
hip O
strap O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
shoulder O
straps O
. O

I O
can O
do O
anything O
online O
with O
this O
device O
including O
streaming O
music O
and O
movies O
through O
services O
like O
Amazon O
Prime O
. O

I O
've O
had O
the O
Portege O
R705-P41 O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
now O
and O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O

We O
have O
been O
thru O
this O
just O
6 O
months O
ago O
. O

Lack O
of O
heat O
- O

On O
Bluetooth O
it O
is O
really O
good O
. O

So O
far O
it O
been O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
very O
fast O
, O
nice O
key O
board O
and O
big O
clear O

Save O
yourself O
the O
money O
and O
headaches O
and O
get O
a O
portable O
Samsung O
burner O
instead O
( O
at O
almost O
half O
the O
price).As O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
illuminated O
keyboard O
in O
the O
latest O
editions O
, O
it O
was O
largely O
a O
cosmetic O
feature O
, O
not O
bright O
enough O
to O
be O
practical O
during O
nighttime O
use O
. O

Given O
that O
I O
've O
only O
owned O
it O
for O
a O
week O
or O
so O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
yet O
speak O
to O
the O
robustness O
of O
the O
zippers O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
and O
immediatly O
plugged O
the O
battery O
pack O
in O
and O
within O
another O
hour O
the O
phone O
was O
half O
charged O
but O
the O
battery O
pack O
was O
out O
of O
juice O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
'm O
considering O
paying O
for O
a O
wireless O
broadband O
subscription O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
that O
card O
internal O
as O
with O
the O
Dell O
and O
HPs O
. O

Was O
60miles O
from O
St. O
Louis O
and O
picked O
up O
all O
HD O
and O
digital O
signal O
with O
no O
problem O
while O
camping O
in O
a O
state O
park O
. O

After O
researching O
my O
order O
I O
noticed O
I O
had O
selected O
the O
short O
12 O
inch O
cables O
by O
accident O
. O

I O
just O
received O
this O
keyboard O
yesterday O
and O
have O
put O
it O
into O
use O
. O

But O
Divx O
/ O
AVI O
files O
play O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
have O
noticed O
that O
the O
touchpad O
seems O
a O
bit O
squishy O
when O
moving O
the O
mouse O
cursor O
, O
and O
very O
sensitive O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
touchpad O
on O
my O
other O
computer O
, O
a O
MacBook O
. O

I O
got O
off O
a O
friend O
. O

In O
use O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
for O
over O
3 O
weeks O
, O
works O
just O
as O
intended O
. O

Love O
this O
bag O
and O
i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
have O
the O
luxury O
of O
having O
all O
your O
gear O
with O
you O
, O
all O
the O
time O
! O
! O
! O

So O
why O
this O
would O
n't O
work O
with O
this O
one O
particular O
case O
/ O
keyboard O

so O
I O
do O
not O
disturb O
others O
. O

I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
with O
the O
laptop O
. O

The O
lining O
of O
the O
compartments O
for O
the O
computer O
and O
tablets O
is O
a O
super O
soft O
plush O
keeping O
them O
safe O
from O
scratches O
and O
buffering O
bumps O
. O

We O
bought O
this O
netbook O
for O
an O
Alaskan O
Cruise O
so O
we O
would O
have O
music O
and O
email O
with O
us O
wherever O
we O
were O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
the O
" O
warranty O
" O
is O
on O
this O
, O
but O
I O
need O
a O
replacement O
NOW O
and O
will O
likely O
just O
need O
to O
buy O
another O
unit O
. O

Keyboard O
- O
I O
really O
like O
the O
chicklet O
layout O
of O
the O
keyboard O
. O

This O
backpack O
also O
does O
n't O
hurt O
your O
shoulders O
. O

wo O
n't O
order O
again O
from O
them O
as O
I O
order O
2 O
things O
both O
were O
not O
as O
stated O
. O

You O
see O
, O
upon O
the O
release O
of O
Windows O
8 O

1 O
, O
( O
allegedly O
, O
according O
to O
others O
with O
the O
same O
issue O
) O
, O
intel O
wifi O
drivers O
have O
horrible O
DNS O
default O

( O
or O
something O
like O
that O
) O
and O
this O
results O
in O
MANY O
MANY O
completely O
DROPPED O
.. O
nay O
, O

The O
product O
worked O
exactly O
as O
advertised O
. O

Your O
tablet O
can O
function O
as O
both O
a O
tablet O
and O
a O
netbook O
. O

Decided O
to O
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
storage O
at O
home O
, O
streamline O
items O
when O
I O
go O
out O
... O

I O
can O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
to O
others O
. O

Ultrabook O
( O
Midnight O
Silver O
) O
) O
and O
an O
almost O
unbeatable O
value O
proposition O
. O

That O
said O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
looking O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
very O
practical O
in O
many O
ways O
for O
anybody O
who O
needs O
a O
big O
screen O
. O

I O
needed O
something O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
replace O
it O
with O

I O
still O
find O
it O
helps O
considerably O
especially O
during O
low O
lighting O
situations O
such O
as O
being O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
checking O
mails O
first O
thing O
at O
dawn O
where O
you O
would O
find O
yourself O
typing O
passwords O
or O
quick O
email O
replies O
in O
these O
low O
lighting O
situations O
. O

So O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
using O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
look O
at O
directions O
or O
anything O
else O

then O
that O
you O

My O
only O
complaint O

which O
is O
not O
a O
fault O
of O
the O
adapter O
, O
is O
anytime O
my O

it O
does O
not O

can O
also O
use O
it O
as O
a O

via O
one O

I O
could O
find O
no O
difference O
in O
performance O
no O
matter O
which O
side O
of O
the O

I O
bought O
this O
PC O
for O

the O
web O
, O
dealing O
with O
email O
, O
text O

editing O

I O
have O
not O
bought O
into O
that O
crap O

When O
I O
received O
my O
laptop O
in O
the O

my O
first O
concern O
was O
put O
to O
rest O
when O
I O
saw O
it O
was O
packed O
well O
and O
also O
made O
it O
to O
me O
in O
one O
piece O
. O

It O
is O
also O
Bluetooth O
compatible O

( O
as O
mentioned O
) O
has O

. O

There O
are O
two O
slit O
pockets O
on O
the O
back O
that O
are O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
smartphones O
, O
business O
cards O
, O
or O
writing O
instruments O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
features O
is O
that O
you O
can O
move O
your O
character O
with O
your O
thumb O
in O
MMOs O
, O
FPS O
's O
, O
etc O
... O

You O
can O
still O
easily O
see O
the O
keys O
in O
the O
dark O
though O
because O
the O
skin O
reflects O
the O
light O
from O
the O
led O
- O
lcd O
screen O
better O
than O
the O
keys O
. O

It O
meets O
all O
my O
expectations O
. O

As O
I O
was O
filling O
out O
the O
email O
to O
ask O
this O
question O
I O
called O
them O
and O
asked O
a O
phone O
agent O
. O

For O
ergonomics O
, O
the O
bag O
comes O
with O
a O
waist O
belt O
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
item O
full O
time O
! O

The O
drive O
itself O
is O
probably O
not O
defective O
! O

but O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
manage O
a O
decent O
speed O
. O

Recommend O
to O
anyone O
..... O

i O
still O
like O
it O

Highly O
recommend O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
. O

so O
hopefully O
the O
first O
cable O
was O
a O
dud O
and O
the O
next O
will O
last O
a O
good O
but O
longer O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
with O
my O
external O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
. O

My O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
Note O
fits O
perfectly O
in O
this O
sleeve O
. O

I O
can O
dream O
of O
a O
lighter O
more O
powerful O
battery O
and O
squeeze O
in O
a O
DVD O
drive O
somewhere O
. O

They O
are O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

Also O
on O
the O
laptop O
part O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
it O
has O
its O
own O
zipper O
to O
get O
into O
it O
, O
AND O
where O
the O
laptop O
is O
placed O
is O
a O
velcro O
strap O
to O
further O
prevent O
slippage O
and O
you O
could O
still O
fit O
a O
notebook O
or O
two O
in O
that O
side O
and O
the O
walls O
are O
padded O
front O
to O
back O
to O
soften O
blows O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
like O
the O
patern O
on O
this O
, O
plain O
and O
simple O
. O

This O
backpack O
is O
designed O
so O
that O
you O
can O
transport O
a O
laptop O
if O
you O
would O
like O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
know O
why O
the O
retail O
price O
of O
the O
bag O
is O
listed O
as O
more O
than O
$ O
100 O
, O
because O
this O
is O
definitely O
not O
worth O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
. O

This O
one O
has O
great O
wheels O
and O
handle O
and O
is O
very O
well O
built O
- O
especially O
considering O
the O
price O
. O

From O
what O
I O
have O
read O
, O
120HZ O
by O
itself O
does O
not O
make O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
, O
but O

and O
I O
went O
to O
check O
my O
e O
- O
mail O
. O

As O
anyone O
who O
has O
ever O
carried O
a O
PC O
case O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
big O
Winblows O
fan O

I O
still O
have O
n't O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
keep O
the O
address O
bar O
at O
the O
top O
of O
webpages O
on O
this O
, O
and O
have O
Internet O
Explorer O
11 O
on O
several O
computers O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
has O
lost O
that O
address O
bar O
! O

( O
beyond O
the O
VDI O
thing O
of O
course O
... O
but O
remember O
this O
section O
is O
in O
consumer O
mode O

If O
you O
try O
repositioning O
the O
laptop O
and O
cooler O
( O
ie O
push O
it O
back O
) O

It O
's O
actually O
more O
like O
a O
smartphone O
with O
an O
great O
screen O
and O
excellent O
keyboard O
. O

IS O
THE O
WEAR O
AND O
TEAR O
IT O

At O
forty O
dollars O
it O
becomes O
an O
option O
to O
other O
computer O
speakers O
, O
but O
has O
several O
advantages O
: O
self O
- O
powered O
, O
rechargeable O
, O
reasonably O
long O
battery O
life O
, O
all O
in O
one O
unit O
, O
thumbdrive O
and O
SD O
card O
readers O
, O
easily O
- O
accessible O
controls O
... O
and O
it O
can O
be O
used O
with O
pretty O
much O
any O
device O
that O
has O
a O
headphone O
plug O
. O

i. O
e. O
do O
you O
need O
to O
check O
disks O
after O
reassigning O
them O
to O
the O
array O
, O
do O
you O
need O
to O
format O
them O
again O
, O
etc O
. O
who O
knows O
. O

They O
'll O
never O
need O
to O
sit O
through O
a O
Windows O
update O
, O
a O
virus O
scan O
, O
or O
get O
a O
BSOD O
. O

After O
it O
arrived O
I O
spent O
some O
time O
playing O
with O
it O
and O
am O
absolutely O
amazed O
at O
theoverall O
quality O
of O
the O
pen O
which O
was O
a O
big O
relief O
since O
spending O
so O
much O
for O
a O
pen O
worried O
me O
. O

Highly O
Recommended O
! O

They O
obviously O
want O
consumers O
to O
pay O
their O
over O
priced O
longer O
cable O
after O
purchasing O
their O
tablets O
! O

So O
no O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
a O
mouse O
replacement O
for O
me O
. O

The O
ultimate O
non O
- O
descript O
camera O
bag O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
negatives O
that O
I O
have O
run O
across O
. O

Most O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
it O
works O
good O
with O
my O
Dell O
XPS O
laptop O
. O

Other O
than O
these O
four O
issues O
, O
it O
's O
a O
really O
nice O
bag O
. O

Does O
not O
come O
with O
a O
drive O
. O

Works O
well O
with O
my O
Asus O
Slider O
and O
is O
pleanty O
long O
. O

I O
then O
plugged O
the O
power O
strip O
into O
a O
Belkin O
Conserve O
Socket O
( O
about O
$ O
10 O
) O
which O
is O
plugged O
into O
the O
wall O
. O

You O
can O
install O
VLC O
player O
to O
replace O
it O
. O

Somehow O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

First O
off O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
mention O
that O
it O
seems O
the O
company O
has O
changed O
this O
case O
since O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
were O
written O
. O

The O
mounting O
tabs O
are O
more O
annoying O
than O
helpful O
splatted O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
my O
macbook O
. O

and O
it O
worked O
flawlessly O
.. O
then O
just O
in O
about O
2 O
months O
just O
stopped O
working O
. O

6&#8221 O
; O
WXGA O
display O
and O

You O
may O
want O
to O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
replacement O
did O
not O
cost O
me O
anything O
and O
that O
I O
did O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
get O
a O
replacement O
. O

Nobody O
beats O
Tivo O
at O
their O
game O
. O

Wanted O
to O
view O
the O
picture O
on O
my O
computer O
on O
the O
big O
screen O
. O

IMHO O
, O
at O
the O
iM237 O
price O
point O
there O
are O
several O
much O
better O
alternatives O
( O
from O
Altec O
Lansing O
and O
Logitech O
, O
and O
others O
) O
that O
I O
would O
purchase O
instead O
. O

I O
originally O
got O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
Android O
Tablet O
, O
but O
with O
the O
added O
convenience O
of O
the O
keyboard O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
run O
full O
Windows O
applications O
, O
and O
the O
full O
license O
for O
Office O
, O
I O
find O
myself O
using O
it O
for O
my O
primary O
home O
computer O
. O

I O
also O
use O
Case O
Logic O
pouches O
and O
bags O
for O
my O
cameras O
. O

, O
it O
has O
a O
very O
small O
usb O
stick O
but O
it O
stores O
in O
the O
mouse O
itself O
. O

Good O
travels O
... O

no O
software O
features O
with O
my O
card O
, O
just O
pure O
card O
. O

For O
its O
size O
, O
the O
woofer O
included O
is O
mindblowing O
, O
the O
songs O
have O
a O
deep O
bass O
that O
one O
has O
come O
to O
expect O
from O
Lansing O
. O

After O
my O
experience O
with O
this O
productComponent O
video O
( O
YPbPr O
) O
/ O

whatever O
else O
you O
'd O
like O
to O
carry O
along O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
this O
really O
weird O
toxic O
smell O
, O
but O
after O
a O
week O
of O
airing O
out O
the O
smell O
diminished O
. O

Absolutely O
pleased O
with O
this O
charger O
, O
so O
much O
that O
I O
ordered O
another O
one O
. O

so O
I O
called O
Medialink O
's O
tech O
support O
. O

The O
mouse O
was O
always O
in O
the O
same O
room O
with O
the O
same O
laptop O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

It O
can O
create O
basic O
office O
documents O
( O
docs O
, O
spreadsheets O
, O
presentations O
) O
and O
export O
them O
for O
use O
in O
MS O
office O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
drop O
the O
pen O
to O
type O
in O
a O
field O
and O
then O
pick O
the O
pen O
back O
up O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
that O
anyone O
thinking O
about O
getting O
this O
unit O
, O
consider O
looking O
at O
other O
options O
, O
including O
the O
mybook O
option O
( O
s O
) O
. O

The O
camera O
becomes O
another O
drive O
in O
Windows O
Explorer O
that O
you O
just O
drag O
to O
your O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
actually O
like O
it O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
through O
no O
fault O
of O
the O
PC O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
is O
just O
a O
biiit O
too O
small O
. O

2 O
GB O
is O
what O
PCs O
should O
have O
these O
days O
when O
using O
Vista O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
the O
crucial O
& O
# O
34;ReadyBoost&#34 O
; O
on O
my O
computer O
that O
is O
allowing O
me O
enough O
RAM O
to O
write O
this O
. O

Just O
know O
its O
plastic O
and O
remember O
its O
about O
1/3 O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
Apple O
Keyboard O
. O

Being O
able O
to O

and O
more O
is O
a O
positive O
thing O
as O
well O
. O

but O
if O
you O
unlock O
it O
and O
expand O
it O
to O
2-inches O
high O
you O
get O
a O
great O
full O
bass O
sound O

one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
heard O
in O
this O
price O

This O
mouse O
works O
well O
with O
my O
Windows O
7 O
laptop O
and O
Windows O
8 O
desktop O
. O

Carrying O
it O
is O
easy O
, O
I O
have O
stuffed O
it O
upto O

They O
are O
also O
the O
adapters O
for O
England O
. O

I O
then O
used O
the O
wizard O
of O
the O
Intel O
Graphics O
control O
panel O
( O
right O
click O
and O
properties O
) O
and O
then O
selected O
( O
under O
scaling O
) O

I O
tried O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
my O
PC O
AND O
Macbook O
but O
the O
Archos O
locked O
up O
. O

1 O
to O
be O
fairly O
frustrating O
and O
unintuitive O
. O

IT O
HAS O
PERFORMED O
PERFECTLY O
. O

It O
seems O
pretty O
good O
. O

Install O
was O
a O
breeze O
and O
worked O
perfectly O
with O
the O
PS4 O
. O

It O
's O
O{K O
, O
but O
kind O
of O
retro O
. O

There O
are O
many O
versions O
of O
these O
mini O
wireless O
bluetooth O
keyboards O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
this O
one O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
crowd O
. O

This O
could O
matter O
if O
one O
needs O
to O
easily O
remove O
the O
filter O
when O
making O
a O
presentation O
on O
the O
screen O
that O
you O
want O
more O
than O
one O
person O
to O
see O
. O

I O
also O
use O
them O
on O
my O
glass O
lenses O
which O
I O
constantly O
smudge O
up O
. O

So O
this O
tablet O
can O
be O
run O
in O
parent O
mode O
, O
where O
it O
's O
an O
Android O

And O
of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
not O
suggested O
to O
me O
by O
any O
of O
the O
tech O
support O
people O
that O
I O
contacted O
. O

These O
adapters O
work O
very O
well O
and O
allowed O
me O
to O
use O
a O
motherboard O
with O
USB2 O
connectors O
with O
a O
case O
that O
has O
USB3 O

It O
's O
not O
indestructible O
, O
but O
few O
cases O
are O

The O
plus O

In O
the O

it O
boots O
in O
50 O
seconds O

even O
though O
I O
usually O
just O
shut O
the O
lid O
to O
put O
it O
to O
sleep O

open O
it O
for O
instant O

I O
just O
got O

a O
two O

I O
tried O

The O

people O
complained O
about O
the O

area O
not O
having O
enough O

which O
is O
ridiculous O
as O
well O

This O
effectively O

I O
first O
bought O
one O
from O
the O
local O
BB O
and O
found O
it O
terrible O
for O
watching O
Netflix O
, O
the O

would O
stutter O
even O
after O
adjusting O
the O

the O

pretty O
good O
for O

Read O
the O
reviews O
, O
considered O
our O
previous O
good O
experiences O
with O
Toshiba O
, O
and O
bought O
this O
model O
. O

Works O
great O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
our O
keyboard O
. O

but O
everything O
came O
as O
stated O
on O
the O
main O
page O

Bought O
it O
because O
it O
may O
be O
the O
last O
of O
the O
3D O
capable O
notebooks O
with O
this O
processing O
power O
. O

I O
know O
the O
Tablet O
willnow O
be O
collecting O
cobwebs O
, O
and O
so O
will O
our O
laptop O
probably O
. O

So O
it O
's O
been O
over O
a O
decade O
since O
I O
used O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

Let O
me O
state O
that O
this O
is O
the O
5th O
Dell O
system O
in O
my O
home O
. O

Still O
happens O
, O
but O
now O
have O
longer O
period O
of O
operation O
. O

Easy O
to O
set O
up O
. O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
it O
would O
n't O
have O
any O
mechanism O
for O
keeping O
it O

Charges O
my O
Thrive O
and O
no O
issues O
with O
it O

She O
's O
able O

the O

when O
she O
want O
other O
to O
hear O
a O

from O
her O

anyways O
, O
clearly O
a O
shoddily O
made O
product O

The O
laptop O
stopped O
working O
and O
was O
unrepairable O
. O

Now O
we O
will O
see O
if O
Amazon O
will O
honor O
return O
policy O

it O
fit O
the O

size O

a O
departure O
from O
most O
other O
laptop O
sleeves O
which O
are O
one O
plain O
color O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
and O
some O
alternating O
color O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

The O
double O
siding O
is O
cool O
. O

but O
sometimes O
I O
slip O
a O
notebook O
or O
book O
in O
it O
too O
. O

DOES O
NOT O
GUARANTEE O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
escape O
the O
headaches O
of O
dealing O
with O
a O
PC O
. O

All O
that O
in O
a O
fairly O
light O
package O
. O

That O
would O
be O
a O
bad O
investment O
on O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
functional O
, O
but O
several O
years O
old O
. O

In O
all O
honesty O
, O
spec O
wise O
, O
it O
's O
insane O
this O
only O
costs O
$ O
250 O
when O
HP O
is O
charging O
more O
for O
less O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
and O
seller O
. O

Although O
my O
car O
can O
connect O
to O
my O
iPhone O
via O
BT O
and O
stream O
audio O
, O
I O
had O
bought O
an O
accessory O
that O
allowed O
me O
to O
see O
the O
video O
- O
out O
from O
my O
iPhone O
and O
the O
display O
was O
much O
nicer O
than O
anything O
that O
came O
stock O
in O
the O
car O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
also O
running O
cooler O
as O
an O
added O
bonus O
. O

Just O
unpacked O
a O
brand O
new O
Sony O
VAIO O
T13124CXS O
touchscreen O
Windows O
8 O
Laptop O
. O

Probably O
nothing O
will O
help O
. O

Sine O
then O
the O
mouse O
on O
my O
desk O
top O
went O
out O

Then O
I O
caught O
a O
good O
price O
for O
it O
on O
amazon O
and O
placed O
an O
order O
. O

Nice O
and O
large O
, O
giving O
the O
fact O
this O
is O
a O
very O
small O
device O
. O

I O
use O
this O
with O
my O
Dell O
XPS O
m1530 O
and O
am O
very O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

i O
just O
would O
have O
bought O
a O
new O
intel O
wireless O
card O
on O
amazon O
and O
been O
happy O
... O
but O
there O
was O
no O
way O
i O
was O
going O
to O
start O
tearing O
apart O
a O
notebook O
without O
any O
type O
of O
guidance O
. O

Good O
Quality O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
ordered O
it O
online O
. O

and O
I O
can O
carry O
another O
purse O
with O
it O
without O
struggling O
. O

There O
is O
the O
option O
to O
remove O
the O
cover O
if O
you O
find O
it O
rather O
annoying O
. O

Use O
it O
in O
the O
car O
, O
it O
stays O
in O
the O
car O
, O
so O
it O
goes O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
abuse O
, O
heat O
, O
cold O
, O
twisting O
, O
spilling O
. O

The O
compartment O
that O
houses O
the O
laptop O
will O
not O
hold O
much O
else O
when O
a O
17 O
" O
is O
inserted O
. O

Otherwise O
perfect O
. O

an O
external O
drive O
.. O

and O
again O
, O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

They O
should O
have O
designed O
it O
with O
that O
in O
mind O
. O

Here O
in O
Seattle O
, O
OTA O
transmissions O
arrive O
from O
all O
points O
of O
the O
compass O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
easy O
solution O
and O
much O
better O
on O
the O
eyes O
than O
staring O
at O
the O
iPad O
for O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
. O

THIS O
PRODUCT O
WORKRD O
GREAT O
, O

The O
Iconia O
is O
a O
chunk O
tab O

begin O
with O

does O
the O
job O
i O
need O
it O
for O
. O

Never O
any O
issues O
when O
purchasing O
through O
Amazon O
... O

At O
least O
fine O
with O
me O
. O

I O
sleep O
with O
my O
Android O
tablet O
streaming O
Pandora O
to O
my O
other O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
and O
it O
sometimes O
stops O
. O

I O
travel O
a O
lot O
and O
pack O
fairly O
heavy O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
anticipate O
using O
this O
Cosmos O
case O
more O
than O
five O
times O
a O
year O
, O
so O
it O
suits O
my O
needs O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
impossible O
to O
install O
without O
bubbles O
on O
your O
screen O
! O

There O
is O
so O
much O
space O
in O
this O
pack O
, O
I O
love O
it O
! O

The O

3 O

screen O
looks O
great O
( O
resolution O

although O
it O
is O
glossy O
instead O
of O
matt O
. O

and O
they O
work O
great O
for O
my O
Latitude O
. O

, O
this O
is O
my O
first O
Win8 O
machine O

The O
only O
USB O
adaptor O
that O
I O
could O
find O
that O
fit O
this O
requirement O
was O
the O
Edimax O

. O

I O
've O
backed O
up O
all O
my O
bluray O
DVDs O
to O
my O
macbook O
with O
this O
drive O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
missed O
a O
beat O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
it O
and O
am O
thinking O
of O
getting O
other O
Bluetooth O
enabled O
devices O
! O

It O
's O
a O
lot O
more O
fun O
than O
talking O
on O
the O
phone O
! O

I O
have O
been O
using O
Windows O
forever O
, O
but O
this O
is O
my O
first O
Macbook O

, O
and O
it O
is O
true O

With O
the O
maturation O
of O

the O
addition O
of O

and O
the O
abundance O
of O

services O
, O
Chrome O
OS O
now O
offers O
a O
full O
solution O
for O
most O
needs O
. O

Port O
forwarding O
is O
a O
drag O
to O
perform O
, O
in O
part O
because O
of O
the O
unintuitive O
look O
and O
feel O
, O
in O
part O
because O
every O
minor O
change O
requires O
a O
lengthy O
system O
pause O
( O
though O
not O
quite O
a O
reboot O
, O
luckily!).- O
Worst O
, O
the O
unit O
has O
a O
reliability O
problem O
; O
at O
random O
times O
( O
though O
typically O
during O
heavy O
data O
traffic O
) O
, O
the O
unit O
spontaneously O
resets O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
find O
a O
better O
value O
. O

I O
needed O
an O
sturdy O
tote O
to O
carry O
my O
10 O
" O
netbook O
around O
, O
as O
it O
does O
a O
lot O
of O
traveling O
. O

It O
works O
like O
it O
should O
and O
protects O
my O
Nook O
Tablet O
. O

The O
silver O
palm O
rest O
protectors O
match O
my O
Macbook O
PERFECTLY O
. O

You O
can O
feel O
the O
quality O
and O
tell O
it O
is O
built O
to O
last O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
item O
is O
what O
I O
would O
have O
wanted O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
shell O
does O
the O
job O
it O
needs O
to O
do O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
keyboard O
cover O
( O
more O
on O
that O
in O
a O
second O
) O
. O

I O
've O
been O
carrying O
this O
bag O
everywhere O

Its O
design O
is O
simple O
and O
straightforward O
, O
yet O
very O
attractive O
. O

I O
read O
some O
of O
the O
issues O
that O
were O
common O
problems O
like O
the O
space O
bar O
malfunctioning O
the O
system O
partition O
being O
too O
small O
, O
the O
trackpad O
being O
finicky O
and O
having O
issues O
with O
flash O
video O
playback O
. O

The O
rollers O
are O
quite O
nice O
; O
very O
smooth O
and O
fluid O
. O

so O
I O
just O
plug O
them O
in O
when O
he&#8217;s O
not O
around O
. O

I O
must O
say O
, O
this O
has O
been O
the O
worst O
router O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

I O
took O
this O
item O
to O
Portugal O
with O
me O
and O
it O
was O
great O
. O

Gets O
very O
warm O
at O
the O
palm O
area O
during O
charging O
phase O
. O

original O
battery O
died O
. O

All O
the O
other O
designers O
I O
believe O
are O
a O
little O
jealous O
. O

the O
fan O
is O
big O
and O
silent O
with O
only O
one O
speed O
as O
you O
plug O
it O
in O
. O

but O
I O
really O
have O
to O
pack O
it O
in O
, O
would O
be O
perfect O
if O
it O
was O
just O
a O
bit O
wider O

The O
battery O
itself O
looks O
great O
with O
great O
details O
. O

I O
installed O
it O
on O
the O
weekend O
, O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
the O
customer O
service O
would O
be O
available O
.... O

3 O
" O
size O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
bordering O
on O
too O
big O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
go O
any O
bigger O
. O

so O
if O
your O
external O
USB O
device O
has O
its O
own O
power O
supply O
or O
adapter O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
fine O
. O

Ultra O

Mini O
Hub O
( O
F5U407 O
) O
is O
not O
perfect O
( O
what O
is O
? O
) O

Powerful O
good O
graphics O
, O
but O
its O
a O
bit O
heavy O
and O
the O
form O
factor O
for O
putting O
this O
on O
your O
lap O
and O
trying O
to O
type O
is O
not O
good O
. O

like O

I O

These O
errors O
may O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
upgrades O
that O
Toshiba O
introduced O
in O
its O
manufacturing O
process O
, O
but O
failed O
to O
include O
in O
its O
manual O

I O
'm O
blown O
away O
at O
how O
awesome O
this O

looks O

Works O

This O

I O
've O
had O

for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
now O
and O
can O
heartily O
endorse O
the O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
( O
SC O
) O
. O

The O
16 O
" O
screen O
maintains O
a O
nice O
balance O
of O
generous O
size O
& O
decent O
portability O
, O
though O
folks O
looking O
for O
something O
light O
and O
svelte O
would O
probably O
want O
to O
pursue O
something O
smaller O
. O

I O
sit O
my O
tablet O
in O
the O
case O
and O
wrap O
these O
two O
straps O
around O
it O
, O
sealing O
it O
with O
the O
Velcro O
, O
and O
it O
securely O
holds O
my O
tablet O

Wanted O
to O

saw O

The O

I O
still O

I O
just O
use O
it O
for O

what O

rather O
90 O

that O

I O
had O
issues O
with O
my O
old O

I O
recommend O
this O
bag O
to O
laptop O
owners O
that O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
accessories O
with O
them O
most O
of O
the O
time O

Let O
's O
face O
it O
... O

Small O
enough O
to O
be O
convenient O
but O
a O
big O
enough O
hardrive O
to O
load O
up O
with O
movies O
and O
such O
. O

We O
bought O
this O
about O
three O
weeks O
ago O
to O
replace O
a O
dying O
Dell O
Latitude O
with O
XP O
that O
we O
had O
for O
over O
eight O
years O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
work O
well O
with O
the O
protective O
case O
still O
on O
the O
tablet O
, O
and O
it O
takes O
some O
use O
before O
the O
Xoom O
will O
slide O
onto O
the O
dock O
easily O
. O

I O
ordered O
two O
of O
these O
to O
replace O
two O
broken O
cables O
from O
my O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
S2 O
and O
my O
brother O
's O
( O
fragile O
stuff O
) O
. O

Now O
, O
twenty O
four O
hours O
later O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
that O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
yet O
. O

When O
I O
ordered O
this O
bag O
the O
picture O
looked O
nicer O

The O
energy O
star O
sticker O
in O

left O
a O

mess O

I O
had O

There O
are O
no O
pockets O
on O
the O
inside O
or O
outside O
of O
this O
case O
. O

The O
power O
outlets O
work O
just O
fine O
and O

If O
you O
want O
to O
know O
where O
my O
source O
of O
dissatisfaction O
comes O
from O
, O
go O
to O
an O
Apple O
Store O
and O
check O
out O
the O
Incase O
" O
Sling O
" O
line O
of O
very O
minimalist O
cases O
for O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
series O
. O

It O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
constructed O
of O
the O
highest O
quality O
materials O
, O
or O
have O
the O
most O
helpful O
progress O
notification O
for O
the O
user O
( O
only O
one O
small O
light O
flashes O
occasionally O
to O
inform O
you O

, O
hence O
the O

This O
9 O
cell O
battery O
enables O
me O
to O
use O
my O
laptop O
for O
4 O
straight O
hours O
without O
needing O
a O
recharge O
. O

I O
found O
the O
laptop O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Bought O
this O
laptop O
because O
I O
wanted O
a O
powerful O
but O
portable O
replacement O
for O
my O
PC O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
tossed O
this O
out O
, O
though O
, O
because O
its O
USB O
charging O
capability O
is O
actually O
useful O
for O
charging O
my O
MP3 O
player O
without O
having O
to O
have O
the O
computer O
on O
. O

Encore O
Dual O
Port O

no O
longer O
being O
sold O
. O

This O
does O
take O
care O
of O
the O
problem O
but O
can O
you O
imagine O
you O
have O
to O
install O
the O
driver O
once O
every O
2 O
to O
3 O
days O
? O

When O
you O
close O
the O
lid O
, O
tape O
does O
scratch O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
'd O
go O
for O
the O
Seasonic O

Let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
" O
criticisms O
" O
that O
some O
people O
may O
discuss O
or O
may O
want O
to O
know O
before O
buying O
: O
Screen O
and O
speakers O
then O
I O
will O
go O
into O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
device O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
recently O
and O
from O
a O
performance O
and O
features O
perspective O
, O
it O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

Works O
fine O
for O
my O
Toshiba O
laptop O
with O
bluetooth O
mouse O
and O
Soundfreaq O
speaker O
. O

However O
I O
do O
use O
it O
everynight O
to O
charge O
my O
phone O

I O
originally O
gave O
these O
cables O
five O
stars O
. O

So O
the O
screen O
size O
really O
is O
nt O
a O
issue O
. O

This O
way O
, O
cord O
length O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
issue O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
mainly O
for O
email O
and O
Internet O
access O
while O
traveling O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
companion O
to O
a O
few O
other O
energy O
efficiency O
enhancements O
( O
ssd O
and O
Windows O
8 O
. O

The O
problem O
with O
that O
is O
that O
it O
will O
not O
work O
in O
most O
digital O
cameras O
( O
it O
is O
recommended O
that O
if O
you O
use O
this O
with O
a O
digital O
camera O
, O
that O
you O
format O
it O
INSIDE O
the O
digital O
camera O
itself O
) O
, O
and O
it O
wo O
n't O
work O
in O
most O
digital O
picture O
frames O
, O
which O
includes O
mine O
, O
the O
Dynex O
DPF7A O
picture O
frame O
. O

The O
down O
sides O
are O
boot O
time O
and O
battery O
life O
. O

I O
had O
bought O
ones O
from O
my O
mom O
at O
a O
store O
a O
few O
months O
back O
and O
whe O

I O
have O
had O
this O
set O
up O
for O
about O
2 O
months O
and O
use O
it O
daily O
without O
issue O
. O

This O
will O
vary O
by O
person O
but O
with O
the O
keys O
missing O
above O
WASD O
I O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
bet O
most O
gamers O
will O
hate O
this O
Gameboard O
at O
first O
. O

This O
was O
purchased O
as O
a O
replacement O
to O
my O
mother O
's O
laptop O
charger O
as O
the O
original O
one O
had O
stopped O
working O
. O

If O
you O
are O
also O
a O
windows O
user O
and O
thinking O
of O
moving O
to O
Mac O
, O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
. O

It O
's O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
before O
it O
crashes O
. O

Main O
features O
that O
make O
it O
a O
great O
buy O
for O
the O
price O

This O
causes O
the O
keyboard O
to O
get O
kind O
of O
sticky O
, O
and O
not O
that O
pleasant O
to O
use O
. O

This O
a O
nice O
well O
built O
laptop O
! O

Can O
get O
channels O
from O
China O
now!. O
Saved O
my O
marriage O
. O

I O
must O
admit O
everything O
is O
aesthetically O
appealing O
. O

In O
todays O
day O
an O
age O
that O
s O
a O
big O
bonus O
. O

The O
only O
minor O
issue O
I O
have O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
backlight O
for O
low O
- O
light O
conditions O
. O

If O
they O
come O
up O
with O
the O
same O
bag O
with O
a O
strap O
that O
can O
make O
it O
a O
cross O
body O
bag O
I O
'll O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

The O
protruding O
cam O

They O
had O
staff O
and O
Nabi O
" O
fan O
" O
( O
volunteers O
) O
available O
on O
Facebook O
all O
week O
including O
Christmas O
day O
answering O
questions O
and O
helping O
out O
. O

I O
know O
I O
can O
probably O
diagnose O
it O
, O
but O
I O
think O
instead O
i O
'll O
opt O
for O
an O
internal O
drive O
since O
they O
last O
for O
years O
, O
are O
faster O
, O
and O
quieter O
. O

The O
hard O
drives O
in O
these O
laptops O
are O
not O
very O
good O
either O
, O
mine O
began O
failing O
within O
4 O
months O
and O
the O
diskeeper O
application O
sucks O
and O
scans O
and O
rescans O
and O
re O
- O
defrags O
the O
system O
for O
no O
reason O
. O

The O
Inateck O
works O
well O
with O
my O
iMac O
, O
but O
I O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
Ethernet O
connection O
with O
Macbook O
Pro O
Retina O
on O
OS O
- O
X O
Mavericks O
. O

It O
is O
a O
speedy O
, O
solid O
upgrade O
. O

You O
just O
push O
down O
on O
the O
top O
to O
turn O
it O
off O
and O
on O
and O
there O
is O
a O
cool O
blue O
glowing O
light O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
pretty O
pleased O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
great O
at O
multitasking O
- O
I O
am O
often O
running O
MS O
Word O
, O
PowerPoint O
, O
and O
internet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
and O
sometimes O
have O
Adobe O
Photoshop O
going O
too O
, O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
program O
. O

I O
especially O
like O
the O
metal O
hardware O
( O
with O
a O
brushed O
aluminum O
finish O
) O
for O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
catches O
on O

My O
girlfriend O
says O
its O
a O
very O
manly O
looking O
laptop O
, O
lol O
. O

I O
love O
how O
small O
and O
portable O
this O
is O
and O
the O
keyboard O
is O
pretty O
roomy O
for O
an O
11 O
. O
6 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

( O
but O
fits O
nicely O
) O

Very O
good O
value O
. O

But O
the O
detailing O
is O
great O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
great O
. O

It O
feels O
a O
little O
cheap O
, O
but O
hopefully O
it O
lasts O
long O
enough O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
cable O
, O
although O
it O
is O
pretty O
thin O
. O

My O
compact O
disk O
drive O
, O
my O
camera O

, O

- O

This O
product O
is O
so O
good O
and O
the O
price O
so O
low O
that O
I O
feel O
guilty O
for O
buying O
it O
, O
like O
I O
stole O
it O
! O
:-) O
. O

The O
Plexiglass O
support O
also O
allows O
me O
to O
shift O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
computer O
so O
that O
I O
do O
not O
need O
to O
cramp O
my O
wrists O
to O
one O
side O
. O

The O
amount O
of O
gear O
you O
can O
fit O
in O
this O
thing O
( O
lenses O
, O
bodies O
, O
laptop O
, O
etc O
) O
is O
unparalleled O
with O
any O
bag O

Kirabook O
has O
a O
15 O
% O
longer O
battery O
life O
than O
Samsung O
Ativbook O
and O
Asus O
zenbookOverall O
, O
I O
like O
kirabook O
better O
due O
to O
its O
stronger O
performance O
and O
longer O
battery O
life O
and O
nicer O
screen O
. O

You O
cannnot O
just O
type O
, O
but O
have O
to O
look O
at O
screen O
, O
to O
be O
ready O

backspace O

Great O
for O
just O

Plan O
- O
an O
expensive O
but O
necessary O
requirement O
if O
you O
buy O
an O
apple O
laptop O
. O

Had O
to O
recover O
some O
files O
from O
my O
old O
computer O
that O
I O
forgot O
to O
back O
up O
and O
computer O
was O
dead O

This O
in O
combination O
with O
a O
proper O
re O
- O
paste O
of O
the O
thermal O
paste O
around O
the O
GPU&CPU O
; O
was O
the O
perfect O
option O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

It O
took O
hours O
to O
correct O
that O
little O
problem O
because O
I O
'm O
in O
Oregon O
while O
he O
's O
in O
Arizona O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
, O
and O
I O
found O
a O
video O
on O
YouTube O
that O
showed O
the O
entire O
process O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
it O
and O
am O
extremely O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Apple O
's O
going O
to O
sell O
millions O
of O
them O
. O

It O
works O
just O
fine O
, O
no O
real O
problems O
touch O
typing O

DO O
NOT O
OPEN O
THE O

FROM O

With O
what O

me O
I O
am O
supposed O
to O
do O
a O

then O
use O
the O
restore O

and O
then O
restore O
the O

His O
picture O
quality O
did O
not O
resemble O
mine O
, O
his O
may O
have O
been O
due O
to O
exposure O
to O
moisture O
after O
the O
seal O
was O
broken O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
screw O
coming O
loose O
. O

but O
it O
was O
very O
frustrating O
to O
try O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O
before O
it O
crashed O
and O
died O
. O

I O
have O
also O
had O
my O
share O
of O
incidences O
and O
scares O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

so O
I O
decided O
to O
stretch O
for O
~$200 O
more O
and O
get O
a O
computer O
. O

They O
just O
simply O
quit O
on O
their O
on O
. O

You O
just O
need O
a O
sound O
card O
with O
decent O
gain O
on O
the O
mic O
and O
slide O
the O
mic O
volume O
up O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
card O
reader O
! O

Google O
continues O
to O
push O
innovation O
year O
after O
year O
, O
Chromebooks O
are O
no O
exception O
. O

so O
no O
performance O
issues O
whatsoever O
( O
as O
other O
reviewers O
have O
experienced O
) O
. O

The O
connection O
is O
very O
tight O
not O
like O
the O
original O
. O

These O
are O
hard O
to O
find O
in O
retail O
, O
so O
if O
you O
have O
a O
machine O
that O
uses O
this O
kind O
of O
power O
supply O
, O
spend O
the O
$ O
26 O
and O
get O
a O
spare O
before O
it O
is O
too O
late O
. O

I O
know O
some O
of O
their O
stuff O
is O
made O
in O
China O
, O
and O
there O
's O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
- O
i O
however O
paid O
up O
for O
this O
one O
because O
i O
knew O
it O
was O
made O
in O
the O
US O
and O
was O
the O
company O
's O
signature O
line O
. O

easy O
to O
apply O
, O
great O
product O
for O
the O
price O
, O
packaged O
with O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
. O

I O
have O
an O
older O
Mac O
G4 O
Powerbook O
, O
and O
I O
have O
had O
some O
trouble O
running O
newer O
devices O
from O
the O
USB O
ports O
due O
to O
the O
age O
of O
my O
computer O
. O

I O
actually O
use O
mine O
as O
completely O
portable O
speakers O
as O
well O
, O
running O
them O
off O
several O
battery O
packs O
( O
i O
have O
a O
velcro O
strip O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
powered O
speaker O
to O
attach O
a O
rechargeable O
battery O
back O
with O
a O
jack O
adapter O
to O
the O
power O
input O
) O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
expecting O
Bose O
quality O
, O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
disappointed O
in O
that O
respect O
. O

The O
product O
still O
works O
( O
on O
SOME O
computers O
) O
. O

While O
the O
560 O
M O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
570 O
M O
that O
the O
MSI O
sported O
, O
the O
much O
cooler O
temps O
, O
the O
quiet O
, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
- O
the O
lack O
of O
hardware O
faults O
, O
all O
make O
up O
for O
the O
slightly O
inferior O
graphics O
card O
. O

the O
glowing O
apple O
is O
not O
as O
revealed O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
pictures O
because O
the O
case O
remains O
the O
solid O
color O
causing O
the O
glow O
to O
not O
be O
white O
and O
as O
bright O
. O

easy O
to O
use O
, O
easy O
to O
lock O
and O
unlock O
. O

I O
have O
reinstalled O
windows O
8 O
on O
an O
inspirion O
1501 O
for O
others O
to O
know O
. O

I O
love O
the O
idea O
of O
it O
- O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
wow O
me O
like O
it O
should O
. O

o O
w O
response O
. O

Works O
exactly O
as O
expected O
in O
my O

These O
little O
suckers O
really O
rock O
! O

The O
actual O
wire O
feels O
" O
gummy O
" O
and O
delicate O
compared O
to O
another O
micro O
OTG O
cable O
I O
bought O
on O
Amazon O
for O
$ O
2 O
. O
76 O
. O

I O
should O
note O
that O
it O
is O
bulky O
which O
does O
seem O
to O
add O
noticeable O
weight O
to O
devices O
I O
use O
while O
they O
're O
charging O
. O

I O
guess O
for O
someone O
who O
wants O
to O
watch O
a O
program O
while O
waiting O
for O
a O
raid O
to O
get O
going O
, O
this O
is O
very O
useful O
, O
but O
the O
small O
screen O
( O
for O
me O
at O
least O
) O
is O
n't O
conducive O
to O
movie O
/ O
TV O
- O
watching O
. O

One O
major O
drawback O
is O
the O
USB O
plug O
that O
powers O
it O
. O

Did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
, O
laptop O
would O
n't O
boot O
, O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
ram O
was O
bad O
or O
just O
my O
laptop O
did O
n't O
like O
them O
, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
return O
them O
. O

The O
first O
, O
most O
common O
use O
is O
to O
recharge O
my O
smartphone O
, O
iPad O
, O
iPod O
. O

None O
of O
these O
pockets O
are O
padded O
either.- O
With O
the O
bag O
that O
holds O
this O
much O
, O
you O
need O
a O
really O
good O
shoulder O
strap O
. O

Still O
better O
that O
buying O
from O
toshiba O

This O
battery O
fits O
and O
works O
as O
well O
as O
the O
more O
expensive O
battery O
offered O
by O
the O
computer O
maker O
. O

The O
same O
goes O
for O
gaming O
and O
other O
high O
- O
processor O
useage O
apps O
. O

Came O
on O
time O
. O

If O
you O
're O
skillful O
and O
are O
passionate O
about O
DIY O
, O
then O
this O
netbook O
is O
perfect O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
the O
only O
stuff O
I O
have O
on O
my O
netbook O
are O
a O
couple O
articles O
I O
have O
written O
and O
some O
images O
for O

A O
good O

PC O

This O
lets O
you O
view O
the O
tablet O
this O

in O
3 O
angles O

Very O
well O
constructed O
. O

Things O
just O
happen O
, O
trust O
me O
. O

Your O
main O
usage O
is O
web O
surfing O
and O
documenting O
, O
I O
recommend O
you O
to O
get O
a O
Macbook O
Air O
. O

Works O
great O
, O
light O
and O
durable O
. O

It O
fits O
the O
MacBook O
13 O
inch O
unibody O
like O
a O
glove O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
product O
. O

If O
I O
hit O
the O
volume O
button O
up O
or O
down O
, O
a O
loud O
beep O
occurs O
. O

My O
tests O
using O
a O
standard O
16 O
GB O
Sandisk O
SD O
card O
were O
very O
impressive O
as O
well O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
alright O
, O
but O
they O
will O
get O
you O
by O
in O
a O
pinch O
. O

so O
if O
you O
move O
the O
panda O
it O
comes O
unplugged O
and O

It O
's O
a O
long O
, O
crappy O
process O
applying O
it O
, O
but O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
extra O
effort O
. O

You O
can O
read O
about O
all O
the O
details O
of O
this O
touchpad O
in O
the O
product O
description O
. O

Because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
huge O
oversight O
on O
their O
part O
on O
an O
otherwise O
fully O
functional O
product O
, O
I O
have O
to O
take O
away O
3 O
stars O
from O
this O
review O
. O

I O
proceeded O
to O
install O
the O
VPN O
software O
. O

For O
me O
this O
pen O
has O
been O
a O
life O
saver O
. O

It O
never O
needs O
removed O
but O
can O
be O
if O
you O
so O
desire O
and O
stored O
in O
the O
bottom O
beside O
the O
batteries O
. O

The O
pen O
itself O
feels O
a O
little O
different O
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
performance O
of O
this O
quality O
. O

I O
must O
reiterate O
. O

THE O
FIRST O
CASE O

Return O
was O
refused O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
so O
far O
at O
all O
and O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
great O
product O
. O

They O
do O
a O
better O
job O
at O
keeping O
the O
laptops O
cooler O
than O
the O
other O
kind O
, O
that O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
I O
used O
a O
placemat O
under O
and O
that O
worked O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
up O
to O
a O
32 O
GB O
card O
and O
it O
reads O
the O
tracks O
immediately O
. O

No O
, O
it O
's O
not O
" O
skin O
tight O
" O
in O
the O
back O
near O
the O

, O
but O
it O
's O
very O
close O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
notice O
it O
unless O
you O
're O
really O
looking O
for O
it O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
pose O
any O

Anyone O

The O
good O

I O
have O
used O

my O

change O

I O
use O
their O

This O
is O
my O
first O

Since O

the O

you O
're O
set O

Just O
check O
the O

A O

around O
Targus O

the O

all O
was O

Three O

Would O

I O
purchased O

Amazon O

All O
went O
well O
except O
during O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
case O
bottom O
I O
pulled O
the O
rubber O
loose O
on O
the O
edges O
and O
the O
nice O
fit O
and O
finish O
that O
Apple O

famous O
for O

no O

At O

there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
continue O
using O
the O

the O

jack O
was O
blocked O
. O

This O
raises O
my O

my O

so O
that O
my O

is O

always O
hanging O
down O

the O

An O

Needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
have O
a O
HP O
Pavilion O
6915nr O
and O
needed O
a O
new O
AC O
power O
adapter O
. O

I O
turned O
off O
the O
tablet O
to O
charge O
this O
time O
. O

The O
hardware O
met O
my O
expectations O
, O
but O
the O
installation O
software O
( O
which O
I O
downloaded O
since O
the O
CDR O
was O
an O
older O
version O
) O
was O
kind O
of O
buggy O
. O

Anything O
I O
can O
get O
to O
work O
as O
well O
as O
this O
card O
does O
in O
Linux O
I O
will O
surely O
recommend O
. O

I O
've O
measured O
it O
at O
about O
1 O
min O
after O
inactivity O
. O

and O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
time O
to O
get O
a O
new O
one O
. O

They O
are O
very O
colorful O
and O
she O
likes O
to O
use O
them O
with O
the O
lights O
low O
or O
off O
. O

Frankly O
, O
I O
was O
not O
expecting O
much O
from O
the O
speaker O
in O
terms O
of O
sound O
as O
I O
have O
always O
settled O
for O
& O
# O
34;tinny&#34 O
; O
sound O
from O
past O
travel O
speakers O
just O
figuring O
that O
's O
the O
way O
it O
was O
unless O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
spend O
over O
$ O
50 O
. O

I O
heeded O
to O
replace O
the O
battery O
on O
an O
older O
( O
2006 O
) O

Oh O
, O
not O
to O
forget O
, O
this O
little O
number O
comes O
with O
a O
stylus O
( O
it O
is O
not O
capacitive O
) O
. O

Unit O
replace O
an O
HP O
original O
which O
was O
4 O
years O
old O
. O

and O
I O
'll O
look O
for O
a O
good O
bluetooth O
headset O
for O
my O
phone O
- O
more O
expensive O
, O
and O
I O
love O
the O
headset O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
but O
this O
does O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
professional O
, O
although O
I O
do O
dabble O
in O
photography O
but O
my O
passion O
is O
computers O
, O
I O
just O
love O
them O
whether O
it O
's O
the O
newest O
technology O
, O
design O
, O
ease O
- O
of O
- O
use O
or O
whatever O
else O
you O
can O
think O
of O

Typing O
is O
always O
faster O
-- O
and O
more O
accurate O
. O

so O
next O
time O
i O
get O
it O
from O
them O
again O
. O

but O
ok O
, O
I O
was O
surprised O
that O
it O
not O
gets O
hot O
like O
others O
replacement O
adapters O
that O
I O
have O
used O
with O
other O
computers O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
's O
wonderful O
. O

I O
have O
plugged O
my O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
to O
it O
, O
and O
I O
used O
double O
- O
sided O
tape O
to O
hold O
the O
hub O
in O
one O
place O
. O

I O
believe O
many O
people O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
the O
G750JX O
without O
the O
SSD O
since O
everyone O
can O
purchase O
an O
SSD O
with O
cheaper O
price O
and O
higher O
speed O
. O

For O
this O
price O
it O
is O
a O
great O
supplement O
for O
various O
uses O
for O
any O
computer O
user O
, O
and O
I O
totally O
recommend O
it O
for O
everyday O
use O
. O

We O
bought O
this O
as O
a O

It O
has O
4 O

This O

The O
only O
way O
I O
see O
that O
it O
could O
be O
any O
better O
, O
is O
if O
it O

and O
I O
can O

If O

I O

I O
use O

The O

attractive O

The O

recognized O
the O
battery O
and O
proceeded O
to O
charge O
it O
upon O
installation O
. O

Having O
the O
HDMI O
is O
just O
a O
great O
plus O
, O
it O
means O
that O
you O
can O
directly O
connect O
it O
into O
your O
HDTV O
and O
have O
a O
super O
big O
monitor O
at O

the O
possibilities O

almost O
everything O

when O
I O
got O
it O

I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O

Replaced O

a O

that O

multiple O
missing O

OKChanging O
your O

the O
above O

It O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
keep O
tucked O
away O

not O
being O
used O

I O
used O
the O

instead O
of O
using O
the O

put O
it O
physically O
on O
the O

just O
wish O
they O
came O

few O
tweaks O

Sometimes O
my O

is O

then O
the O

is O
weird O

I O
had O
no O

The O
build O

as O

the O

liked O

another O

The O
answer O
to O
all O
your O
problems O
- O
hell O
no O

for O
everything O
else O
Android O
gives O
you O
the O

to O
move O

easily O
to O
other O

and O
flash O

for O

Now O
it O
does O
nothing O

cause O
problems O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
Mediabridge O
is O
selling O
this O
as O
a O
charging O
- O
only O

since O
it O
does O
n't O
work O

Charge O
Android O

if O
the O

does O
n't O
have O
the O

shorted O
. O

Naturally O
, O
I O
have O
other O
capacity O

, O
but O
having O
one O
larger O

makes O
it O
real O
easy O
to O
swap O

between O
them O
all O

At O
the O
price O
, O
and O
I O
have O
tested O
those O
300 O
and O
400 O
dollar O
units O
with O
the O
fancy O

Note O
that O
their O
ratings O
are O
higher O

other O

Sharkk O
provided O
my O
with O
this O
keyboard O
for O
free O
to O
test O
and O
provide O
a O
non O
- O
biased O
. O

Another O
problem O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
camera O
needs O
to O
remain O
plugged O
into O
a O
power O
source O
while O
transferring O
. O

Perfectly O
audible O
to O
me O
though O
. O

so O
you O
know O
when O
it O
is O
getting O
bad O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
to O
say O
this O
bag O
is O
a O
wonderful O
travel O
companion O
. O

The O
experience O
with O
our O
second O
, O
identical O
Macbook O
, O
is O
why O
I O
have O
to O
give O
3 O
stars O
instead O
of O
5 O
for O
an O
otherwise O
strong O
performance O
product O
, O
that O
can O
run O
both O
Windows O
and O
Mac O
, O
that O
comes O
bundled O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
software O
, O
and O
that O
looks O
really O
cool O
( O
especially O
on O
a O
college O
campus O
where O
almost O
everyone O
has O
Macs!)A O

I O
later O
found O
out O
that O
for O
fast O
reliable O
connection O
, O
I O
really O
want O
to O
extend O
5 O
g O
instead O
of O
2 O
g O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
solution O
for O
recording O
video O
on O
my O
iphone O
5 O
and O
ipad O
. O

It O
drove O
me O
nuts O
for O
a O
bit O
when O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
the O
Boombox O
( O
it O
shows O
" O
headset O
" O
) O
in O
the O
playback O
window O
, O
but O
could O
in O
the O
record O
window O
. O

One O
star O
down O
from O
perfect O
because O
of O
the O
stiff O
keyboard O
and O
screen O
issues O
, O
and O
the O
truly O
TERRIBLE O
Asus O
website O
, O
but O
really O
quite O
an O
amazing O
value O
. O

The O
laptop O
does O
( O
expected O
) O
get O
fairly O
warm O
when O
running O
hardware O
- O
intensive O
programs O
( O
CS5 O
, O
for O
example O
) O
, O
so O
consider O
a O
nice O
cooling O
fan O
unit O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

If O
you O
need O
a O
webcam O
, O
this O
is O
a O
webcam O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
to O
this O
netbook O
is O
the O
sound O
quality O
; O
I O
think O
it O
could O
be O
better O
, O
and O
would O
have O
made O
it O
perfect O
, O
deserving O
a O
5-star O
. O

The O
power O
cable O
had O
no O
& O
# O

and O
was O
easy O
to O
plug O
in O
. O

There O
is O
little O
to O
no O
chance O
of O
water O
seeping O
in O

This O
is O
a O
must O
have O
for O
the O
road O
warrior O

wo O

I O

most O
important O
to O
me O
, O
it O
's O
quiet O

I O
use O
this O
with O
my O
PC O
for O
ham O

. O

Most O
of O
the O
other O

I O
was O
contemplating O
purchasing O
were O
made O
of O
plastic O
and O
just O
felt O

cheap O

if O
you O

that O
have O

on O

you O

an O

Verdict O
: O
WINNER O
! O

A O
" O
left O

" O
is O
executed O
by O
pushing O
down O
on O
the O
pad O
: O
a O
loud O
click O
is O
heard O
to O
give O
you O
feedback O
. O

It O
does O
work O
fine O
at O
VGA O
resolutions O
, O
but O
the O
picture O
quality O
is O
too O
low O
. O

Battery O
life O
was O
sufficient O
for O
me O
, O
but O
not O
stellar O
: O
maybe O
3 O
- O
4 O
hours O
. O

I O
upgraded O
to O
Windows O
7 O
Home O
Premium O
and O
installed O
2 O
GB O
of O
memory O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
installed O
a O
small O
client O
from O
Dyn O
DNS O
client O
. O

The O
one O
I O
had O
prior O
to O
this O
was O
poorly O
made O
and O
stopped O
working O
after O
just O
a O
couple O
months O
. O

My O
only O
tiny O
aggravation O
is O
that O
my O
laptop O
can O
and O
does O
slide O
sideways O
off O
the O
pad O
if O
I O
move O
around O
too O
much O
, O
but O
honestly O
, O
compared O
to O
other O
pads O

A O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
netbook O
. O

The O
price O
was O
great O
. O

You O
sure O
can O
fit O
a O
Netbook O
computer O
on O
but O

Easy O
to O
use O
and O
very O
big O
sound O
for O
such O
a O
small O
product O
. O

First O
, O
Altec O
has O
made O
the O
unbelievable O
decision O
to O
point O
the O
mids O
straight O
down O
and O
into O
your O
desk O
. O

the O
car O
reads O
fast O
on O
my O
macbook O
air O
and O
reads O
fast O
in O
my O
camera O
I O
love O
having O
it O
as O
a O
back O
up O
and O
really O
have O
to O
always O
fight O
my O
big O
brother O
from O
stealing O
it O
from O
me O

This O
bag O
has O
great O
compartments O
and O
i O
can O
fit O
my O
ipad O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
good O
thumb O
- O
type O
keyboard O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
am O
a O
technician O
, O
I O
belive O
this O
would O
be O
very O
easy O
for O
the O
average O
non O
- O
tech O
or O
technical O
saavy O
user O
. O

I O
only O
wish O
that O
there O
was O
a O
tad O
more O
padding O
for O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
but O

Now O
I O
can O
have O
my O
KF O
horizontal O
or O
vertical O
because O
all O
I O
do O
is O
plug O
in O
the O
charger O
and O
audio O
port O
if O
I O
want O
the O
sound O
to O
come O
through O
the O
speaker O
or O
just O
charge O
to O
charge O
it O
. O

After O
having O
put O
my O
PS4 O
in O
standby O
twice O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
by O
surprise O
by O
the O
seemingly O
near O
- O
instantaneous O
firing O
up O
of O
the O
PS4 O
when O
it O
's O
turned O
on O
now O
. O

I O
contacted O
MicroSATA O
Cables O
and O
they O
promptly O
sent O
me O
an O
extender O
kitgratis O
. O

You O
just O
ca O
n't O
beat O
this O
for O
the O
price O
, O
and O
if O
there O
is O
a O
re O
- O
design O
that O
fixes O
the O
stand O
issue O
for O
roughly O
the O
same O
price O
I O
paid O
for O
this O
one O
, O
I O
'll O
definitely O
purchase O
it O
. O

During O
the O
early O
days O
of O
LCD O
/ O
plasma O
television O
, O
there O
was O
no O
internet O
connectivity O
/ O
apps O
for O
watching O
things O
like O
Netflix O
, O
Hulu O
, O

. O

This O
was O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
BT O
is O
always O
nice O
as O
you O
can O
move O
about O
freely O
with O
your O
phone O
or O
MP3 O
player O
in O
your O
pocket O
, O
BUT O
at O
the O
slight O
sacrafice O
of O
leaving O
your O
phone O
or O
MP3 O
player O
close O
to O
the O
unit O
, O
wired O
, O
you O
can O
enjoy O
a O
few O
more O
hours O
of O
music O
if O
you O
longer O
music O
times O
planned O
. O

Some O
of O
it O
is O
a O
waste O
since O
it O
gets O
smooshed O
down O
when O
you O
tighten O
the O
clip O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
more O
intricacies O
than O
with O
OSX O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
getting O
used O
to O
it O
and O
have O
to O
say O
the O
user O
interface O
is O
top O
notch O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
small O

either O
, O
nor O
do O
I O
have O
small O
hands O

Perfect O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O

how O

it O

provides O

In O
general O
the O
old O
ram O
was O
really O
expensive O
across O
the O
few O
brands O
that O
offered O
it O
considering O
it O
was O
for O
only O
1 O
gb O
and O
slower O
legacy O

( O
even O
for O

their O

was O
better O

, O
you O

noticed O

minute O
later O
my O
DVD O
player O
and O
my O
Apple O
TV O
would O
come O
back O
on O
then O
turn O
off O
. O

The O
company O
has O
no O
website O
to O
download O
drivers O
from O
. O

I O
am O
attaching O
a O
picture O
illustrating O
the O
problem O
, O
if O
you O
still O
have O
q O
's O
contact O
me O
or O
responmd O
to O
this O
review O
and O
I O
will O
reply O
back O
. O

The O
outer O
pocket O
hold O
the O
power O
adapter O
and O
even O
has O
a O
spot O
for O
a O
thumb O
drive O
. O

Especially O
like O
the O
waterproof O
cover O
built O
into O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bag O
that O
's O
easily O
accessed O
in O
a O
sudden O
downpour O
, O
and O
the O
built O
- O
in O
sideways O
camera O
sleeve O
located O
near O
the O
back O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
cord O
to O
attach O
my O
iPhone O
to O
the O
car O
Aux O
port O
. O

Copied O

and O
then O
installed O

bit O
. O

The O
lid O
/ O
screen O
should O
close O
flush O
. O

That O
gap O
is O
for O
sliding O
the O
handle O
of O
wheeled O
luggage O
through O
. O

I O
gave O
the O
LC O
speakers O
an O
extra O
star O
because O
of O
its O
independent O
satellite O
speakers O
which O
can O
be O
individually O
plugged O
/ O
unplugged O
into O
the O
subwoofer O
. O

Here O
is O
the O
odd O
part O
- O
The O
9dBi O
antenna O
does O
not O
show O
any O
more O
bars O
then O
the O
standard O
antenna O
nor O
a O
Belkin O
WiFi O
802 O
. O
11n O
without O
an O
external O
antenna O
. O

According O
to O
a O
few O
checks O
with O
an O
inclinometer O
, O
which O
can O
be O
less O
accurate O
because O
of O
friction O
between O
the O
axle O
and O
the O
hole O
surrounding O
it O
, O
the O
angle O
is O
a O
little O
less O
than O
10 O
degrees O
. O

This O
happens O
about O
18 O
months O
to O
two O
years O
into O
owning O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
went O
through O
the O
whole O
process O
of O
exploring O
how O
to O
fix O
it O
, O
and O
the O
consensus O
of O
all O
the O
online O
people O
with O
the O
problem O
is O
not O
even O
HP O
has O
any O
answers O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
AC O
adapter O
since O
August O
2011 O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
any O
indication O
that O
this O
is O
a O
cheap O
product O
. O

- O
I O
have O
had O
no O
problem O
using O
the O
MircoUSB O
with O
android O
phones O
, O
the O
Mini O
- O
USB O
with O
a O
2 O
. O

( O
this O
might O
have O
been O
stolen O
) O
, O
so O
amazon O
does O
an O
awesome O
job O
coordinating O
sells O
from O
other O
small O
businesses O
and O
great O
at O
not O
dealing O
with O
problematic O
bureaucracy O
. O

There O
is O
not O
much O
you O
can O
ask O
from O
a O
power O
supply O
, O
except O
for O
it O
to O
work O
as O
expected O
. O

Nice O
idea O
, O
but O
it O
is O
about O
3&#34 O

in O
length O
... O
not O
really O
long O
enough O
to O
be O
useful.=== O
Summary O
= O

I O
no O
longer O
have O
any O
qualms O
about O
batteries O
or O
chargers O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
had O
some O
sort O
of O
design O
to O
allow O
easier O
carry O
, O
though O
. O

I O
looked O
into O
netbooks O
and O
decided O
that O
they O
were O
really O
too O
small O
for O
what O
I O
needed O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
well O
constructed O
, O
roomy O
enough O
for O
me O
( O
really O
, O
this O
is O
such O
a O
personal O
decision O
for O
us O
road O
warriors O
, O
I O
know O
) O
, O
and O
I O
can O
buy O
7 O
of O
these O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
TUMI O
. O

It O
requires O
disassembling O
a O
substantial O
amount O
of O
the O
keyboard O
section O
to O
get O
at O
the O
underside O
of O
the O
circuit O
board O
so O
that O
the O
cable O
can O
be O
plugged O
in O
. O

I O
've O
posted O
this O
before O
, O
but O
here O
goes O
again O
...... O

I O
know O
its O
dumb O
but O
one O
cable O
is O
2 O
inches O
longer O
and O
drives O
me O
crazy O
. O

if O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
the O
work O
that O
I O
put O
to O
make O
it O
function O
and O
it O
never O
did O
on O
the O
intended O
PC O
I O
would O
had O
given O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

Right O
then O
I O
saw O
the O
Bluetooth O
mouse O
on O
my O
PC O
- O
pairing O
successful O
. O

it O
a O
3 O
or O
4 O
, O
video O
quality O
is O
not O
so O
good O
same O
rate O

No O
stability O
issues O
or O
compatibility O
issues O
- O
it O
just O
works O
! O

It O
's O
On O
mostly O
15 O
hours O
daily O
. O

My O
GF O
bought O
me O
a O
used O
pair O
for O
$ O
42 O
after O
shipping O
and O
they O
came O
ready O
to O
go O
without O
any O
blemishes O
or O
problems O
. O

It O
fits O
, O
but O
is O
tight O
around O
the O
corners O
. O

I O
decided O
that O
I O
would O
make O
my O
own O
mix O
of O
MP3 O
music O
files O
and O
bring O
them O
along O
so O
I O
could O
listen O
to O
them O
through O
my O
headphones O
. O

Gaming O
is O
nice O
at O
max O
settings O
. O

Would O
have O
given O
a O
5 O
except O
the O
mouse O
wheel O
sometimes O
does O
not O
respond O
and O
scrolls O
the O
other O
way O
at O
times O
. O

I O
can O
take O
a O
nice O
computer O
headset O
and O
use O
it O
on O
my O
cell O
phone O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
am O
an O
Senior O
IT O
person O
in O
charge O
of O
Windows O
and O
VMWare O
at O
a O
large O
world O
wide O
company O
, O
so O
I O
needed O
some O
power O
( O
and O
I O
need O
power O
for O
some O
video O
and O
audio O
editing O
) O

Amazon O
wo O
n't O
update O
the O
listing O
on O
this O
item O
, O
but O
the O
" O
Microphone O
Jack O
" O
is O
a O
joke O
at O
best O
. O

Almost O
all O
home O
computing O
around O
my O
place O
is O
on O
tablets O
, O
smartphones O
and O
now O
, O
this O
Chromebook O
. O

It O
feels O
nice O
to O
carry O
around O
either O
by O
the O
handle O
or O
the O
strap O
. O

All O
in O
all O
I O
ended O
up O
replacing O
my O
factory O
stereo O
because O
this O
was O
the O
" O
best O
" O
solution O
I O
could O
find O
, O
which O
fell O
very O
short O
of O
my O
expectations O
. O

Vista O
, O
however O
is O
different O
story O
. O

I O
tried O
sliding O
it O
in O
from O
the O
back O
to O
the O
front O
, O
hoping O
the O
2 O
side O
clips O
would O
just O
fit O
, O
but O
no O
avail O
. O

and O
I O
can O
rock O
out O
and O
not O
bother O
anyone O
. O

My O
wife O
bought O
a O
netbook O
a O
year O
ago O
for O
work O
, O
but O
hardly O
ever O
used O
it O
and O
hence O
decided O
to O
adopt O
my O
old O
15 O
. O

This O
was O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
. O

Its O
got O
tons O
of O
storage O
and O
pkts O
to O
store O
things O
galore O
.. O

The O
tip O
that O
fits O
most O
cell O
phones O
is O
burned O
out O
after O
just O
a O
single O
use O
. O

well O
with O
this O
eye O
piece O
you O
can O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
light O
that O
enters O
the O
camera O
through O
the O
view O
finder O
and O
yet O
still O
be O
comfortable O
taking O
photos O
. O

I O
had O
to O
do O
a O
clean O
install O
of O
Win O
7 O

and O
I O
even O
have O
" O
always O
on O
" O
internet O
with O
it O
built O
in O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
mint O
color O
it O
looks O
horrible O
and O
the O
cover O
does O
wipe O
clean O
. O

The O
Air O
has O
a O
plainly O
superior O
but O
slightly O
smaller O
( O
1 O
" O
smaller O
on O
the O
horizontal O
) O
screen O
and O
battery O
life O
is O
better O
but O
since O
the O
Ar O
has O
a O
solid O
state O
( O
and O
half O
the O
size O
) O
hard O
drive O
this O
is O
not O
surprising O
. O

well O
you O
know O
. O

If O
you O
see O
the O
Zyxel O
itself O
as O
a O
hotspot O
at O
any O
point O
, O
just O
" O
Forget O
" O
it O
. O

it O
seems O
, O
I O
had O
to O
download O
McAfee O
removal O
tool O
. O

I O
have O
over O
200 O
movies O
/ O
shows O
saved O
on O
it O
, O
most O
are O
high O
def O
movies O
, O
and O
have O
used O
about O
600 O
gb O
. O

It O
is O
FREE O
and O
great O
for O
converting O
and O
transferring O
books O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
cute O
cover O
! O

I O
shut O
off O
the O
touchpad O
which O
I O
found O
awkward O
to O
use O
and O
added O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
. O

This O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
it O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
used O
outdoors O
when O
active O
such O
as O
when O
hiking O
or O
biking O
. O

Sometime O
after O
this O
, O
the O
hard O
drive O
become O
corrupted O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
reformatted O
. O

I O
hope O
Mozilla O
Firefox O
comes O
out O
with O
their O
Metro O
version O
soon O
! O

The O
screen O
is O
nice O
and O
I O
have O
grown O
to O
appreciate O
the O
matte O
finish O
. O

The O
shoulder O
clips O
are O
sturdy O
, O
and O
although O
the O
strap O
is O
n't O
padded O
, O
it O
's O
wide O
and O
thick O
. O

Pros O
: O
Affordable O
price O
, O
lengthy O
cable O
, O
very O
compatible O
with O
softwareCons O
( O
not O
GPS O
- O
specific O
) O

By O
default O
router O
was O
also O
set O
to O
neighborhood O
friendly O
145mbps O

Despite O
all O
these O
programs O
, O
my O
computer O
did O
not O
contain O
the O
trial O
for O
Microsoft O
Office O
as O
stated O
. O

Skyrim O
works O
on O
high O
quality O
but O
you O
need O
to O
tone O
down O
antialias O
/ O
anisotropic O
Sample O
rates O
. O

I O
have O
a O
box O
under O
my O
desk O
full O
of O
Logitech O
products O
that O
no O
longer O
power O
up O
after O
inserting O
a O
known O
good O
and O
new O
AA O
battery O
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
my O
point O
was O
that O
this O
bad O
tree O
will O
not O
produce O
good O
fruit O
, O
except O
by O
some O
fluke O
. O

, O
it O
was O
a O
no O
brainer O
to O
go O
with O
the O
13 O
" O
MBP O
. O

The O
14 O
. O
1 O
inch O
case O
is O
really O
a O
13 O
. O
3 O
inch O
case O
, O
so O
it O
just O
barely O
holds O
my O
laptop O
. O

all O
the O
cellphone O
headsets O
being O
so O
light O
and O
one O
/ O
mono O

If O
you O
have O
a O
32 O
bit O
operating O
system O
it O
does O
no O
good O
to O
add O
more O
than O
4 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
. O

Works O
perfectly O
! O

Well O
I O
bought O
this O
version O
based O
on O
the O
other O
reviews O
about O
the O
speed O
etc O
. O

Though O
I O
was O
expecting O
this O
to O
do O
alot O
more O
since O
it O
had O
a O
higher O
rating O
than O
my O
original O
dell O
battery O
. O

My O
sister O
has O
this O
for O
her O
macbook O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

Small O
partitions O
at O
the O
end O
end O
( O
which O
hold O
a O
copy O
of O
Win O
XP O
for O
restore O
purposes O
) O
are O
annoyingly O
positioned O
and O
one O
too O
many O
in O
case O
you O
want O
to O
dual O
boot O
with O
Linux O
. O

issuesCD O
drive O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
, O
but O
who O
really O
cares O
? O

External O
audio O
input O
jack O
does O
not O
work O
with O
normal O
headsets O
. O

The O
Z3740 O
is O
pretty O
even O
with O
the O
Pentium O
in O
multi O
- O
threaded O
workloads O
, O
through O
the O
slower O
single O
- O
threaded O
performance O
will O
be O
more O
evident O
with O
slower O
app O
/ O
program O
launches O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
can O
never O
find O
a O
replacement O
adapter O
to O
fit O
without O
constantly O
falling O
out O
. O

Apple O
still O
does O
not O
offer O
anti O
- O
glare O
screen O
- O
what O
a O
shame O
for O
otherwise O
perfect O
laptop O
. O

These O
refresh O
rates O
help O
to O
cut O
down O
the O
noise O
you O
get O
around O
the O
edges O
of O
moving O
objects O
. O

The O
form O
factor O
and O
SSD O
drive O
makes O
it O
pleasant O
to O
use O
. O

So O
I O
am O
still O
an O
amazon O
. O

A O
hot O
glue O
gun O
and O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
and O
the O
keyboard O
not O
seats O
in O
there O
perfectlly O
and O
is O
nt O
going O
no O
where O
... O

Even O
if O
the O
fans O
were O
n't O
making O
noise O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
this O
purchase O
. O

Looks O
and O
feels O
like O
high O
quality O
, O
and O
even O
comes O
with O
warranty O
. O

She O
, O
has O
loved O
using O
it O
, O
so O
this O
year O
I O
did O
a O
little O
research O
, O
and O
decided O
to O
order O
the O
arm O
based O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
for O
myself O
. O

so O
I O
need O
something O
reliable O
for O
that O
. O

Worked O
great O
in O
Frankfurt O
, O
Germany O
and O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
during O
my O
recent O
business O
trip O
. O

I O
plugged O
in O
the O
Toshiba O
's O
USB O
3 O
cable O
and O
copied O
a O
1 O
GB O
file O
to O
the O
drive O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
very O
much O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
view O
what O
others O
want O
to O
view O
or O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
family O
room O
when O
I O
could O
be O
doing O
something O
constructive O
in O
my O
room O
. O

and O
here O
are O
my O
results O
while O
using O
Honeycomb O
OS O
. O

No O
connectivity O
means O
it O
's O
just O
a O
brickI O
have O
to O
say O
, O
compared O
to O
my O
inexpensive O
netbook O
, O
this O
thing O
feels O
like O
a O
real O
waste O
of O
money O
; O
yes O
you O
do O
get O
some O
bundled O
services O
from O
Google O
, O
but O
$ O
350 O
is O
still O
way O
too O
much O
to O
be O
asking O
for O
this O
level O
of O
hardware O
. O

This O
item O
was O
advertised O
to O
be O
Ready O
Boost O
compatible O
. O

It O
's O
got O
memory O
card O
compartment O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
flap O
off O
the O
camera O
gear O
compartment O
. O

One O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
this O
has O
a O
feature O
to O
turn O
it O
either O
horizontal O
or O
vertical O
while O
plugged O
in O
. O

Also O
, O
in O
spectacular O
fashion O
, O
it O
fulfills O
a O
promise O
that O
was O
made O
in O
2012 O
, O
when O
Intel O
promised O
that O
Ultrabooks O
would O
provide O
us O
with O
lighter O
, O
faster O
, O
cooler O

running O
notebooks O
with O
longer O
battery O
life O
. O

The O

a O
significant O
performance O

( O

over O

and O
word O
processing O
on O
wifi O
with O
brightness O
at O
50 O
% O
and O
keyboard O
backlight O
on O
. O

I O
traced O
my O
problem O
to O
these O
cables O
. O

This O
switch O
is O
simple O
, O
well O
made O
, O
and O
relatively O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

I O
have O
used O
the O
laptop O
sleeve O
for O
my O
15 O
" O
laptop O
, O
it O
fits O
fine O
. O

That O
Friday O
, O
a O
friendly O
driver O
showed O
up O
, O
unloaded O
the O
TV O
, O
and O
brought O
it O
right O
into O
my O
place O
. O

No O
problems O
whatsoever O
. O

Note O
that O
I O
have O
2 O
drives O
striped O
in O
raid-0 O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
loving O
the O
audio O
- O
out O
jack O
. O

I O
heard O
battery O
life O
not O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
usually O
plugged O
in O
. O

Very O
nice O
product O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
pack O
it O
up O
and O
travel O
with O
it O

In O
other O
words O
, O
business O
users O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
, O
even O
if O
it O
's O
portrayed O
as O
an O
" O
entertainment O
" O
notebook O
; O
just O
get O
Vista O
Ultimate O

So O
, O
get O
it O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
! O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
be O
enthusiastic O
about O
a O
power O
supply O
. O

The O
biggest O
selling O
point O
for O
these O
is O
the O
sound O
isolation O
( O
better O
then O
the O
E2C O
's O
also O
) O
. O

Just O
a O
note O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
take O
off O
any O
screws O
to O
remove O
this O
keyboard O
. O

I O
also O
tried O
it O
on O
my O
Raspberry O
Pi O
. O

Fits O
the O
D420 O
just O
fine O
. O

That O
's O
to O
say O
you O
actual O
feel O
and O
hear O
the O
" O
click O
" O
of O
the O
keypress O
, O
without O
the O
key O
registering O
. O

The O
frequency O
range O
they O
give O
of O
100hz-20khz O
is O
over O
a O
rather O
meaningless O
wide O
range O
of O
sound O
level O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
online O
help O
provided O
by O
Samsung O
to O
report O
both O
the O
wireless O
problem O
and O
the O
problem O
with O
the O
cord O
. O

The O
materials O
of O
the O
bag O
is O
of O
high O
quality O
. O

Sure O
, O
strobes O
or O
umbrella O
diffusers O
are O
the O
' O
right O
' O
tools O
for O
our O
work O
, O
but O
man O
, O
this O
really O
did O
the O
trick O
for O
me O
. O

It O
does O
appear O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Sansa O
Clip O
charges O
faster O
if O
it O
is O
turned O
on O
while O
it O
is O
connected O
to O
this O
power O
supply O
. O

super O
cute O
, O
and O
even O
came O
with O
2 O
bonus O
decals O
. O

What O
else O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
! O
! O
! O

Seems O
snappy O
enough O
so O
far O
. O

Great O
bag O
for O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

it O
adds O
a O
very O
nice O
balance O
to O
the O
5R O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
gotten O
the O
longer O
antenna O
they O
balance O
each O
other O
very O
well O
. O

It O
fits O
laptops O
up O
to O
15 O
. O

I O
noticed O
the O
Fat32 O
instructions O
and O
tried O
that O
and O
the O
update O
ran O
perfectly O
. O

I O
make O
a O
LOT O
of O
road O
trips O
through O
the O
midwest O
, O
and O
I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
a O
CB O
with O
me O
, O
in O
case O
I O
have O
an O
emergency O
in O
an O
area O
where O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
a O
signal O
. O

I O
got O
this O
because O
on O
skype O
you O
get O
feedback O
or O
weird O
background O

The O
texture O
is O
perfect O
, O
it O
feels O
great O
, O
but O
is O
n't O
so O
" O
rubbery O
" O
that O
it O
attracts O
and O
holds O
on O
to O
lint O
, O
which O
is O
definitely O
a O
plus O
. O

Having O
made O
the O
switch O
to O
Apple O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
got O
a O
Mac O
Pro O
, O
I O
was O
contemplating O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

, O
I O
can O
shoot O
hours O
of O
HD O
video O
. O

I O
did O
NOT O
buy O
the O
8 O
GB O
chip O
. O

It O
fits O
perfectly O
around O
the O
whole O
computer O
but O
where O
you O
open O
the O
laptop O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
the O
top O
piece O
was O
cut O
too O
short O
and O

Great O
Apple O
stickers O
. O

It O
finally O
gave O
way O
once O
Photoshop O
was O
opened O
and O
I O
started O
to O
play O
around O
with O
it O
. O

All O
of O
these O
multiple O
- O
use O
systems O
feel O
leviathan O
compared O
to O
a O
real O
tablet O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
is O
that O
the O
neck O
would O
either O
be O
a O
little O
stronger O
or O
that O
it O
would O
include O
a O
clip O
to O
fix O
it O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

Small O
, O
well O
made O
, O
works O
perfectly O
without O
even O
having O
to O
install O
a O
driver O
. O

The O
Metro O
tiles O
and O
all O
that O
? O

Piddly O
detail O
, O
I O
know O
, O
but O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
having O
only O
one O
that O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
on O
the O
wrong O
side O
. O

This O
unit O
as O
tainted O
corsairs O
rep O
with O
me O
forever O
. O

This O
would O
not O
be O
possible O
if O
there O
were O
not O
customer O
- O
centric O
companies O
like O
Amazon O
out O
there O
who O
are O
in O
many O
ways O
more O
concerned O
with O
providing O
a O
rewarding O
shopping O
experience O
to O
the O
consumer O
than O
fattening O
their O
bottom O
line O
. O

I O
think O
the O
manufacturer O
should O
look O
into O
using O
stronger O
material O
thatdoesn't O
come O
apart O
from O
the O
zipper O
's O
seam O

every O
time O
I O
think O
of O
how O
nice O
it O
would O
be O
if O
they O
were O
silent O
, O
I O
simply O
touch O
the O
laptop O
and O
am O
reminded O
that O
the O
gentle O
whirring O
of O
the O
fans O
is O
a O
small O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
lower O
temps O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

Although O
I O
never O
before O
saw O
the O
need O
for O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
, O
after O
buying O
a O
new O
17 O
" O
PowerBook O
I O
decided O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
not O
to O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
cables O
. O

the O
first O
cover O
I O
've O
had O
that O
really O
stands O
out O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
terrible O
. O

My O
only O
real O
complaint O
is O
the O
little O
storage O
pockets O
are O
all O
elastic O
mesh O
and O
not O
zippered O
. O

This O
case O
fits O
it O
well O
. O

but O
then O
again O
I O
am O
not O
running O
them O
24/7 O
at O
full O
volume O

$ O
20 O
bucks O
and O
not O
any O
louder O
than O
my O
laptop O
's O
fan O
. O

As O
a O
part O
- O
time O
professional O
photographer O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
carry O
my O
camera O
and O
a O
few O
lenses O
and O
flash O

Good O
deal O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Get O
a O

and O
a O

In O
case O
you O
are O
wondering O
how O
I O
posted O
this O
review O
before O
Christmas O
: O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
wait O
until O
Christmas O
to O
give O
this O
to O
her O
. O

This O
is O
an O
endless O
cycle O
. O

The O
update O
had O
the O
exact O
same O
ID O
as O
the O
one O
I O
downloaded O
which O
stated O
it O
was O
updated O
in O
January O
on O
the O
page O
I O
got O
it O
from O
. O

This O
3 O
in O
1 O
adapter O
is O
as O
sturdy O
as O
any O
other O
adapter O
you O
'd O
buy O
in O
a O
box O
store O
. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
ordering O
for O
myself O
, O
am O
going O
to O
look O
around O
at O
my O
options O
. O

I O
have O
not O
used O
half O
of O
the O
features O
that O
are O
available O
with O
the O
TV O
... O
have O
not O
hooked O
up O
to O
any O
other O
source O
but O
the O
stereo O
. O

Like O
many O
others O
we O
settled O
for O
this O
37 O
" O
TV O
because O
of O
the O
fixed O
size O
of O
a O
expensive O
TV O
cabinet O
. O

I O
have O
128 O
GB O
storage O
. O

I O
purchased O
two O
of O
these O
, O
one O
to O
replace O
the O
existing O
Intel O
WiFi O
1000 O
adapter O
in O
my O
2010 O
model O
ASUS O
laptop O
, O
and O
the O
other O
to O
use O
in O
a O
desktop O
machine O
. O

Knew O
it O
would O
be O
iffy O
, O
but O
for O
$ O
20 O
bucks O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fun O
challenge O
.Microtek O
CD O
Drivers O
, O
and O
Ralink O
Mac O
drivers O
will O
only O
paritally O
work O
on O
Mac O

Mountain O
Lion O
. O

Alienware O
has O
far O
better O
cooling O
than O
the O
Samsung O
, O
with O
practically O
the O
entire O
back O
half O
of O
the O
bottom O
being O
vents O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
my O
laptop O
's O
Ethernet O
died O
and O
the O
WiFi O
connection O
was O
too O
unstable O
and O
slow O
doing O
big O
file O
transfers O
. O

so O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
completely O
open O
the O
bag O
to O
access O
your O
camera O
) O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
or O
a O
professional O
video O
camera O
, O
this O
ai O
n't O
it O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
without O
any O
hesitation O
. O

I O
know O
it O
was O
n't O
the O
hard O
drive O
as O
I O
removed O
it O
and O
ran O
it O
in O
one O
of O
those O
external O
hard O
drive O
bays O
that O
one O
just O
inserts O
the O
exposed O
had O

into O

the O

end O
up O
in O

to O
reach O
positions O
when O
the O
tablet O
is O
mounted O
( O
no O
matter O
how O
you O
mount O
it).2 O
. O

The O
pack O
is O
also O
roomy O
enough O
for O
power O
cables O
, O
mice O
, O
pens O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
books O
. O

and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

ups/ O
EtcAnother O
tip O
is O
to O
make O
a O
recovery O
image O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
hit O
the O
touchpad O
and O
so O
skip O
lines O
when O
typing O
, O
though O
you O
can O
turn O
it O
off O

do O

lived O

this O
little O
sucker O
in O
my O

world O
... O
it O
enhances O
my O

.. O
showed O
off O

Otherwise O
the O

is O
fantastic O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
very O
, O
very O
happy O
customer O

If O
there O
comes O
a O
time O
when O
better O
audio O
quality O
is O
desired O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
enough O
to O
purchase O
some O
high O
quality O

I O
love O
bags O
... O

Definitely O
adequate O
as O
a O
replacement O
and O
at O
a O
much O
better O
price O

Bad O

I O
travel O
a O
lot O
and O
wanted O
extra O
potection O
for O
my O
new O
14&#34 O
; O
laptop O
. O

The O
sound O
going O
into O
the O
mono O
earpiece O
was O
perfect O
, O
and O
everyone O
I O
've O
talked O
to O
over O
my O
Skype O
line O
has O
said O
I O
sound O
crystal O
clear O
, O
like O
on O
a O
real O
phone O
, O
or O
at O
least O
a O
decent O
cell O
connection O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
overheat O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
negatively O
affect O
the O
laptop O
( O
my O
last O
charger O
made O
the O
touchpad O
jumpy O
) O
, O
and O
the O
cord O
is O
much O
longer O
. O

These O
were O
easy O
to O
install O
( O
if O
you O
followed O
the O
instructions O
) O
and O
are O
holding O
up O
just O
fine O
. O

Side O
padding O
does O
not O
exist O
. O

That O
said O
, O
there O
are O
a O
few O
things O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
as O
much O
: O
Each O
of O
the O
separate O
compartments O
in O
the O
main O
pouch O
has O
a O
flap O
over O
the O
top O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
pricy O
compared O
to O
others O
, O
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

The O
only O
plus O
is O
the O
case O
is O
hard O
and O
keeps O
it O
protected O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
deducted O
the O
5th O
star O
was O
because O
of O
the O
inability O
to O
upgrade O
the O
hard O
drive O
or O
memory O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
helpful O
if O
the O
adapters O
came O
with O
some O
general O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
sync O
with O
computers O
and O
devices O
. O

so O
I O
went O
a O
little O
bigger O

and O
it O
has O
no O
rips O
or O
tears O
anywhere O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
a O
cheerleader O
for O
this O
companies O
products O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
thing O
has O
some O
serious O
performance O
issues O

It O
is O

that O

problem O

when O

The O
unit O
also O
looks O
very O
smart O
. O

See O
later O
comments O
at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
review O

This O
is O
a O
great O
mouse O
and O
so O
inexpensive O
that O
If O
it O
dies O
tomorrow O
I O
will O
have O
gotten O
my O
money O

worth O
. O

But O
this O
bag O
is O
still O
doing O
very O
well O
and O
I O
DO O
still O
like O
mine O
. O

and O
I O
intend O
to O
remove O
them O

MS O

being O
among O
them O

but O

Was O
using O
a O
2 O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
does O
manage O
to O
perform O
better O
particularly O
at O
higher O
volumes O
and O
is O
an O
engineering O
marvel O
producing O
good O
bass O
despite O
the O
size O
, O
yet O
suffering O
from O
no O
vibration O
. O

The O
Antenna O
supplied O
will O
only O
work O
if O
you O
live O
close O
to O
a O
TV O
Transmitter O
. O

( O
yes O
, O
I O
bought O
the O
old O
one O

but O
buying O
the O
new O
one O
= O
a O
lot O
of O
100LL O
) O

That O
being O
said O
, O
I O

did O
not O

that O

I O
found O

On O
one O
side O
of O
the O
inside O
of O
this O

there O
is O
a O

I O
took O
this O
back O
pack O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Hawaii O
where O
I O
used O
it O
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

I O
don&#8217;t O
think O
it O
is O
physically O
possible O
to O
provide O
a O
device O
that O
satisfies O
every O
single O
request O
, O
including O
my O
own O

good O
for O

but O
not O
meant O
for O

or O
heavy O

. O

It O
comes O
with O
the O
previously O

also O
passes O
for O
a O

we O
compared O

the O
Dell O

any O
rate O
, O
the O
published O

number O
for O
this O
supply O
did O
n't O
match O
exactly O
what O
was O
printed O
on O
the O
original O
for O
my O
XPS O
501x O
laptop O
, O
but O
this O
looks O
and O
functions O
identically O
so O
far O
. O

The O
problem O
with O
my O
desk O
is O
there O
is O
no O
room O
for O
a O
seperate O
wrist O
- O
support O
to O
go O
as O
they O
are O
all O
too O
big O
to O

So O
far O
it O
has O
n't O
dropped O
the O

Happy O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
make O
use O
of O
an O
old O
laptop O
with O
a O
new O
battery O
. O

Apps O
in O
use O
: O
firefox O
, O
itunes O
, O
office O
, O
photoshop O
, O
premiere O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
problem O
is O
with O
these O
. O

they O
were O
always O
dead O
when O
you O
needed O
it O
. O

To O
the O
good O
, O
I O
got O
the O
unit O
on O
sale O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
tablet O
and O
so O
far O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
as O
advertised O
. O

Some O
neat O
features O
It O
comes O
with O
are O
a O
finger O
print O
reader O
, O
a O
webcam O
, O
& O
full O
keyboard O
with O
a O
track O
pad O
. O

If O
you O
've O
held O
a O
cheap O
half O
plastic O
laptop O
in O
your O
hands O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
come O
up O
with O
this O
trick O
, O
I O
am O
merely O
sharing O
it O
with O
you O
here O
! O

Eventually O
, O
Amazon O
will O
stock O
it O
- O

This O
cover O
is O
nice O
and O
thick O
, O
without O
being O
heavy O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
it O
. O

A O
little O
pricey O
overall O
for O
RAM O
, O
however O
, O
reasonably O
priced O
for O
this O
particular O
type O
of O
RAM O
overall O
. O

They O
're O
worth O
taking O
a O
look O
and O
the O
reviews O
should O
tell O
you O
why O
I O
chose O
the O
HF100 O
instead O
. O

The O
2006 O
BMW O
3 O
series O
does O
not O
have O
an O
available O
interface O
for O
use O
with O
iPhone O
/ O
iPod O
, O
that O
feature O
arrived O
in O
2008 O
( O
I O
think O
) O
and O
was O
a O
$ O
500 O
accessory O
. O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
add O
on O
. O

The O
touch O
pad O
scroll O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
also O
very O
touch O
sensitive O
. O

not O
as O
fast O
as O
my O
3-yr O
old O
desktop O
that O
is O
overclocked O
or O
my O
new O
work O
laptop O
, O
but O
it O
runs O
very O
smoothly O
for O
what O
i O
use O
it O
for O
. O

It O
's O
my O
first O
new O
( O
vs. O
new O
- O
to O
- O
me O
) O
laptop O
, O
so O
these O
are O
fresh O
eyes O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
un O
- O
boxing O
a O
laptop O
. O

This O
was O
a O
reasonably O
priced O
cord O
that O
does O
the O
job O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
. O

If O
you O
're O
willing O
to O
take O
preventative O
measures O
and O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
sealing O

A O
great O
purchase O
at O
this O
price O
. O

I O
suspect O
nothing O
was O
done O
to O
it O

but O
I O
went O
with O
this O
12 O
by O
8 O
because O
it O
was O
the O
perfect O
size O
to O
easily O
fit O
in O
my O
backpack O
. O

Its O
15 O
% O
faster O
then O
the O
GTX O
560 O
M O
and O
not O
much O
slower O
then O
the O
GTX O
580 O
M O
, O
and O
with O
the O
overclock O
option O
on O
this O
MSI O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
hard O
to O
reach O
this O
580 O
M O
stock O
speeds O
. O

, O
i O
just O
could O
n't O
pass O
it O
up O
! O

It O
'll O
ca O
nt O
to O
the O
side O
because O
the O
disc O
is O
rather O
thick O
( O
posted O
an O
image O
) O
, O
so O
be O
wary O
of O
doing O
this O
. O

Really O
nice O
capacity O
. O

And O
for O
the O
record O
... O
yes O
I O
do O
just O
leave O
them O
on O
;) O

It O
will O
be O
more O
risky O
than O
to O
fix O
/ O
upgrade O
a O
normal O
macbook O
air O
. O

Let O
me O
know O
if O
you O
find O
a O
better O
way O
to O
clean O
fingerprints O
. O

Once O
again O
though O
, O
I O
have O
limited O
exposure O
to O
the O
item O
in O
that O
most O
things O
I O
buy O
are O
taken O
by O
my O
significant O
other O
. O

The O
lesson O
here O
is O
-- O
only O
buy O
this O
adapter O
if O
you O
have O
a O
CD O
drive O
! O

Excellent O
price O
. O

With O
this O
keyboard O
skin O
my O
macbook O
look O
like O
it O
is O
the O
original O
and O
the O
original O
do O
not O
take O
any O
dust O
, O
it O
is O
unbelievable O

Works O
Great O
! O
! O
! O
! O

With O
the O
amplification O
powered O
by O
a O
single O
AAA O
battery O
along O
with O
the O
built O
- O
in O
noise O
canceling O
you O
should O
n't O
have O
this O
problem O
, O
even O
in O
noisy O
environments O
. O

Until O
you O
have O
a O
fully O
charged O
battery O
the O
mouse O
wo O
nt O
work O
at O
all O
since O
the O
cord O
connection O
does O
not O
work O
so O
the O
only O
way O
to O
use O
this O
product O
is O
the O
charge O
the O
battery O
yourself O
in O
a O
charger O
and O
then O
just O
treat O
it O
like O
any O
other O
battery O
operated O
wireless O
mouse O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
expecting O
to O
be O
able O
to O
produce O
HD O
videos O
for O
the O
big O
screen O
, O
but O

WHAT O
BOSE O
SHOULD O
HAVE O
DONE O
TO O
BEGIN O
WITH O
, O
and O
especially O
at O
a O
REASONABLE O
price O
point O
( O
which O
this O
is O
not).DON'T O
WASTE O
YOUR O
MONEY O

actual O
picture O
is O
HD O
and O
I O
have O
only O
1 O
complaint O
. O

I O
have O
used O
a O
couple O
different O
Bluetooth O
speakers O
but O
nothing O
as O
big O
as O
this O
set O
. O

The O
meat O
of O
this O
thing O
is O
it O
has O
the O
best O
screen O
AND O
speakers O
of O
any O
portable O
device O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
or O
even O
SEEN O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
power O
cord O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
now O
, O
and O
so O
far O
I O
have O
been O
more O
than O
pleased O
. O

He O
could O
have O
used O
one O
of O
these O
. O
) O

Also O
large O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
w/o O
hand O
cramping O
up O
, O
and O
good O
quality O
material O
. O

There O
's O
plastic O
film O
over O
the O
amazon O
logo O
, O
which O
I O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
peeling O
off O
because O
it O
seems O
to O
blend O
in O
with O
the O
plastic O
, O
but O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

do O
n't O
know O
about O
speed O
, O
but O
it O
does O
play O
dvd O
's O
. O

You O
can O
have O
one O
already O
attached O
to O
a O
body O
as O
well O
. O

I O
was O
happy O
that O
it O
came O
with O
a O
full O
charge O
, O
as O
I O
was O
able O
to O
give O
it O
a O
test O
run O
on O
my O
I O
- O
Pod O
right O
off O
the O
start O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
because O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
the O
fit O

so O
if O
you O
can O
wait O
a O
couple O
days O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
wait2 O
) O

They O
even O
made O
a O
pocket O
under O
the O
cover O
flap O
that O
you O
could O
fit O
small O
things O
in O
. O

And O
that O
is O
not O
the O
only O
flaw O
that O
makes O
you O
wonder O
what O
they O
were O
thinking O
. O

No O
pun O
intended O
it O
is O
an O
ace O
! O

THe O

did O
not O
want O
to O
shut O

This O

bag O
has O
a O
strap O

onto O
the O

The O

, O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
notice O
it O
with O
these O
headphones O
on O

It O
works O
well O

After O
turning O
off O

starting O
up O

the O

I O
received O
it O
and O
hooked O
it O
up O
to O
my O
desktop O
computer O
with O
Windows O
7 O
, O
and O
Windows O
automatically O
found O
the O

installed O
it O

But O
above O
all O
this O
, O
the O

is O
usable O
and O
just O
like O
your O

Your O

look O
different O
from O

but O
the O

is O
to O
ratchet O
down O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
full O

Lighter O

Why O
pay O

When O
I O
connect O
my O

through O
this O
, O
it O
prints O
about O
as O
fast O
as O
a O
dot O
matrix O
circa O
1985 O
. O

And O
it O
's O
too O
light O
to O
make O
a O
good O

. O

This O
is O
the O
WORST O

I O
have O
ever O
seen O

1amp O

( O

included O
) O
and O
lasts O
roughly O
5 O

1/2 O

6 O
hours O
at O
full O
volume O
and O
probably O
more O
if O
it O
is O
at O
a O
lower O

. O

It O
's O
unfortunate O
Apple O
does O
n't O
have O
a O

like O
this O
. O

If O
the O
US O

is O
better O
in O
your O

than O
they O
are O
in O

, O
give O
it O

For O

there O
is O
no O

much O

Let O
me O
start O
by O
saying O
that O
I O
have O
the O

port O
hub O
built O
into O
the O
chillpad O
. O

it O
kindda O
bothers O
me O

This O
AC O
adapter O
works O
and O
is O
just O
like O
my O
original O
. O

The O
shipping O
was O
n't O
inordinate O
considering O
the O
weight O
. O

I O
see O
a O
flicker O
or O
some O
lag O
. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
signal O
booster O
instead O
, O
eliminating O
the O
need O
for O
the O
splitter O
. O

The O
cable O
with O
the O
proper O
length O
, O
connector O
was O
obviously O
the O
right O
connector O

Not O
clear O
from O
the O
description O
( O
at O
least O
to O
my O
16 O
year O
old O
) O

This O
hub O
solves O
both O
those O
issues O
handily O
. O

So O
rather O
than O
buy O
a O
new O
desktop O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
docking O
station O
. O

When O
I O
first O
got O
it O

The O
1st O
lap O
top O
I O
owned O
a O
2001 O
Hp O
pavilion O
( O
paid O
$ O
2 O
, O
200 O
) O
when O
I O
put O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
type O
it O
would O
burn O
my O
leg O
( O
it O
always O
had O
to O
be O
on O
table O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
a O
160 O
GB O
laptop O
( O
2 O
. O
5&#34 O
; O
form O
factor O
, O

Excellent O
physical O
foot O
print O
. O

But O
, O
I O
received O
it O
and O
the O
usb O
cord O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

I O
am O
in O
no O
way O
a O
tech O
person O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
with O
a O
new O
500 O
GB O
hard O
drive O
for O
my O
macbook O
( O
early O
2006 O
) O
and O
the O
process O
was O
remarkably O
easy O
. O

One O
thing O

HOWEVER O
it O
fits O
good O
enough O
to O
stay O
on O
and O
serve O
its O
purpose O
. O

so O
I O
could O
make O
a O
clone O
of O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
as O
an O
emergency O
backup O
. O

So O
really O
two O
problems O
I O
guess O
, O
since O
the O
third O
is O
n't O
quite O
laptop O
related O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
much O
given O
it O
's O
a O
new O
laptop O
with O
new O
hardware O
, O
etc O
. O

No O
snap O
crackle O
pop O
! O

If O
you O
're O
like O
me O
and O
you O
carry O
a O
laptop O
, O
iPad O
, O
notebook O
, O
external O
hard O
drive O
, O
and O
various O
other O
vital O
gear O
, O
then O
you O
might O
grow O
frustrated O
with O
the O
space O
limitations O
imposed O
by O
the O
very O
modest O
size O
of O
this O
pack O
. O

Overall O
, O
a O
good O
notebook O
with O
a O
major O
flaw O
of O
essentially O
not O
having O
any O
security O
slot O
( O
which O
could O
have O

Read O
the O

the O
full O
list O

these O
were O
the O
features O
which O
made O
an O
impression O
on O
me O

Many O
10"-or O

will O
love O

on O
their O

Some O
have O
complained O
about O
their O
systems O
throwing O
up O
a O
flag/ O
warning O
that O
it O
is O
not O
an O
OEM O
battery--- O
for O
me O
when O
I O
installed O
Windows O
7 O
it O
got O
rid O
of O
all O
of O
the O
bloatware O
that O
comes O
preinstalled O
, O
including O
some O
of O
the O
Lenovo O
utilities O
that O
are O
not O
needed O
. O

Under O
daily O
active O
usage O
conditions O
, O
one O
set O
batteries O
lasted O
about O
2 O
weeks O
, O
and O
still O
going O

it O
is O
my O
opinion O
that O
good O
value O
is O
to O
be O
had O
anytime O
ordering O
their O
products O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
come O

I O
have O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
've O
contacted O
Patriot O
customer O
support O
, O
it O
took O
about O
a O
week O
to O
get O
an O
RMA O

, O
which O
is O
essential O
to O
have O
your O
broken O
card O
switched O
for O
the O
working O
one O
. O

It O
's O
small O
, O
light O
, O
and O
starts O
up O
quickly O
. O

Somehow O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
have O
them O
both O
pick O
up O
Bluetooth O
separately O
, O
but O
then O
of O
course O
, O
both O
would O
need O
separate O
power O

hope O
to O
see O

with O

Second O
, O
because O
it O
leaves O
both O
USB O
ports O
open O
for O
other O
things O
. O

When O
I O
connected O
this O
speaker O
to O
my O
TV O
box O
to O
use O
as O
a O
TV O
speaker O
, O
I O
have O
to O
hit O
the O
power O
button O
on O
the O
speaker O
because O
it O
turns O
itself O
off O
when O
not O
in O
use O

There O
is O

a O
neat O
little O

at O
the O

of O
the O

i"m O
used O
to O
from O
my O
old O

, O
but O
it O
has O
n't O
been O
an O
issue O

This O

In O

my O
goal O
was O
to O
find O
the O
value O

without O
hurting O
my O
wallet O
, O

This O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O

and O
it O
has O
Windows O
7 O
. O

Keyboard O
and O
screen O
are O
nice O
and O

What O
type O

use O
will O
the O

get O
( O

of O
course O
its O
gon O
na O
be O
nowhere O
near O

good O

I O
have O
had O
this O
charger O
a O
little O
over O
two O
months O
and O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O

There O
is O
no O
speaker O

to O
offer O
any O
protection O
to O
the O

. O

I O
'm O
using O
my O
old O
one O

Caselogic O
had O
done O
a O
great O
service O
for O
those O
of O
us O
that O
own O
long O

with O
this O
bag O
. O

but O
for O
UK O
outlets O
the O
pins O
must O
be O
left O
in O
the O
shorter O
position O
. O

My O
one O
minor O
nitpick O
with O
the O
design O
of O
this O
keyboard O
cover O
is O
that O
I O
do O
not O
like O
its O
use O
of O
the O
two O
thin O
elastic O
straps O
that O
are O
used O
to O
secure O
the O
top O
of O
the O
cover O
to O
the O
bottom O

of O
the O

For O
a O
right O

person O
, O
they O
can O
be O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
computer O
or O
vice O
versa O
for O
a O
left O
handed O
person O
, O
but O
ideally O
they O
should O
be O
put O
in O
the O
back O
along O
with O
the O
power O
plug O
in O
. O

I O
had O
to O
pry O
it O
out O
, O
damaging O
my O
macbook O
pro O
case O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
for O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
1 O
TB O
of O
space O
available O
! O

Despite O
the O
negative O
reviews O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
this O
drive O
for O
my O
10 O
year O
old O
Apple O
Powerbook O
G4 O
Titanium O
500MHz O
. O

:) O
thank O
you O
for O
offering O
this O
at O
a O
wayy O
cheaper O
price O
than O
most O
tech O
stores O
:) O

This O
was O
the O
first O
that O
I O
found O
that O
works O
on O
XP O
, O
Vista O
, O
and O
Vista O

with O
my O
Samsung O

I O
'm O
really O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O

and O
recommend O
it O
with O
confidence O

and O

My O
drive O
started O
to O
make O
a O
loud O
" O
clunk O
" O
sound O
about O
a O
week O
after O
I O
installed O
it O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
technology O
upgraded O
but O
the O
receiver O
did O
n't O
? O

The O

privacy O
filter O
is O
a O
great O
tool O
for O
anybody O
that O
is O
concerned O
about O
keeping O
the O
information O
on O
their O
laptop O
screen O
from O
prying O
eyes O
. O

I O
'm O
guessing O
they O
're O
now O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
desktop O
's O
internal O
drive O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
product O
for O
nearly O
8 O
months O
now O
and O
serves O
me O
well O
. O

My O
original O
Dell O
battery O
died O
just O
over O
a O
year O
from O
when O
I O
bought O
it O
( O
5 O
of O
us O
bought O
same O
laptops O
and O
all O
but O
1 O
of O
them O
lasted O
more O
than O
13 O
months O
, O
last O
one O
lasting O
18 O
months O
so O
makes O
me O
believe O
Dell O
purposely O
makes O
them O
last O
less O
) O

It O
serves O
its O
purpose O
as O
a O
keyboard O
cover O
but O
you O
can O
not O
type O
with O
it O
placed O
on O
. O

What O
really O
stinks O
about O
this O
prodyct O
is O
that O
it O
DOES O
NOT O
come O
with O
the O
wire O
required O
to O
use O
thie O
product O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
Toshiba O
laptop O
with O
17-inch O
screen O
for O
more O
than O
four O
years O
, O
and O
I O
've O
only O
replaced O
the O
battery O
once O

it O

not O
include O
a O

just O
like O
it O

The O

in O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
awesome O
if O
it O
is O
25 O
% O

that O
what O
it O
is O
right O

There O

D O

was O
absolutely O

in O

the O

Unlike O
other O
reviews O
, O
I O
had O
no O
issue O
in O
getting O
my O

Probably O
it O

what O

I O

will O

I O
definitely O
do O
recommend O
it O
! O

did O
the O
job O
well O
probably O
need O
another O

The O
top O

does O
suffer O
slightly O
because O
of O
the O
emphasis O
on O

the O

This O
cable O

what O
it O

Good O
purchase O
! O

You O
really O
can O
not O
beat O
Mediabridge O
for O
quality O

Fits O
well O
into O
the O

and O
provides O
access O
to O
the O
USB O
forall O
the O
devices O
tried O
. O

It O
's O
been O
roughly O
two O
weeks O
since O
purchase O
. O

Nearly O
everything O
I O
can O
do O
on O
my O
PC O
or O
netbook O
, O
I O
can O
do O
on O
my O
Archos O
, O
the O
only O
exception O
being O
many O
flash O
games O
which O
lag O
when O
played O
directly O
from O
the O

but O
play O
flawlessly O
when O
downloaded O
directly O
to O
the O
Archos O
. O

A O
few O
months O
earlier O
, O
I O
had O
purchased O
the O
same O
battery O
from O
a O
different O
seller O
but O
it O
was O
faulty O

I O
have O
a O
Dell O
running O
Windows O
XP O

I O
love O
the O
4x3 O
portrait O
display O
format O
, O
seems O
more O
a O
like O
a O
book O
than O
the O
Cruz O
Tablet O
16x9 O
landscape O
which O
actually O
has O
fewer O
pixels O
available O
than O
this O
model O
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
that O
the O
normally O
clever O
engineers O
at O

M O
have O
n't O
found O
a O
better O
way O
to O
make O
this O
product O
stay O
where O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
go O
. O

The O
title O
is O
misleading O
. O

there O
is O
a O
ton O
of O
content O
that O
is O
tough O
to O
beat O
, O
but O
for O
me O
I O
get O
all O
of O
my O
TV O
shows O
, O
from O
33 O
channels O
right O
off O
of O
my O
free O
air O

fed O
into O

I O
noticed O
that O
one O
reviewer O
questioned O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
positive O
reviews O
( O
and O
some O
others O
shared O
the O
sentiment O
) O
. O

In O

to O
needing O
an O
external O
CD O

DVD O

( O
or O
you O
could O
just O
rely O
on O

a O

The O

a O
little O
tight O

nevertheless O
OK O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
a O
hassle O
, O
but O
they O
re O

pair O
and O
re O

better O
I O
have O

The O
easiest O

ever O

It O

all O
bulky O
and O
has O
2 O
zips O
in O
the O

and O
one O
in O
the O

. O

Multiple O

is O
no O

as O
well O
as O
using O

as O
a O

I O
'd O
never O

a O

I O
like O

This O
is O
a O
really O
well O
made O

except O
mounting O
the O

in O

's O
very O
quick O

there O

this O
one O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
use O
my O
tripod O
hardly O
ever O

sometimes.- O
Webcam O
is O
usable O
but O
the O
quality O
is O
poor O
. O

I O
've O
decided O
to O
keep O
using O
it O
since O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
it O
every O
day O
. O

and O
I O
was O
happy O
to O
find O
this O
seller O
and O
the O
new O
adapter O
works O
perfectly O
. O

The O
construction O
is O
sturdier O
, O
the O
pop O
open O
feature O
is O
great O
( O
it O
fits O
better O
in O
my O
computer O
bag O
) O
, O
the O
lip O
at O
the O
bottom O
holds O
the O
laptop O
more O
securely O
. O

the O
item O
is O
only O
14 O
" O
but O
my O
laptop O
is O
17 O
" O
but O
do O
n't O
worry O
it O
can O
accomodate O
your O
17 O
" O
without O
any O
problem O
. O

Everything O
about O
Windows O
8 O
seems O
like O
a O
bad O
idea O
, O
and O
just O
about O
everything O
you O
want O
to O
do O
takes O
an O
extra O
step O
or O
two O
. O

Functioned O
perfectly O
at O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
purchasing O
locally O
. O

The O
bag O
feels O
sturdy O
, O
the O
handles O
and O
straps O
are O
padded O
, O
and O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
bagel O
" O
pocket O
in O
the O
front O
has O
n't O
held O
a O
bagel O
yet O
, O
but O
it O
's O
great O
for O
a O
snack O
bar O
or O
two O
. O

Add O
the O
aluminum O
case O
, O
Ilife O
apps O
and O
the O
best O
operating O
system O
on O
the O
planet O
and O
the O
price O
shrinks O
some O
. O

On O
the O
front O
of O
the O
screen O
is O
the O
microphone O
, O
a O
web O
camera O
indicator O
, O
the O

and O
a O
large O
button O
under O
the O
screen O
that O
presses O
the O
" O
Windows O
" O
key O
( O
which O
I O
found O
useful O
) O
. O

I O
regret O
not O
doing O
that O
from O
the O
start O
. O

is O
the O
zipper O
is O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
pull O

The O

looks O
brand O
new O
and O
no O

as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
. O

Take O
advantage O
of O
this O
price O
drop O
while O
you O
can O
! O

Most O
rely O
on O
good O
airflow O
underneath O
, O
which O
is O
why O
there O
are O
so O
many O

like O
this O
on O
the O

Please O
, O
Please O
do O
n't O
waste O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
piece O
of O

whenever O
that O

I O
waited O
a O

for O
this O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O

she O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
her O

in O
her O

while O
taking O
a O

( O

the O

It O

a O

It O

to O
an O

I O
find O
the O
stand O
flimsy O
but O
usable O

My O
15 O
inch O
ASUS O

works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

I O
had O
hopes O
that O
it O
would O
be O
. O

This O
sleeve O
is O
well O
built O
and O
its O
modern O
look O
will O
not O
disappoint O
. O

I O
'd O
now O
give O
this O
kit O
a O
2-star O
rating O
. O

It O
looks O
cooler O
than O
stock O
, O
not O
that O
you O
ever O
see O
it O
, O
and O
is O
a O
brand O
I O
trust O
. O

I O
can O
turn O
on O
the O
music O
on O
my O
phone O
on O
my O
nightstand O
and O
move O
this O
little O
speaker O
down O
to O
the O
floor O
while O
I O
stretch O
. O

That O
can O
screw O
up O
your O
color O
scheme O
if O
it O
does O
not O
involve O
blue O
( O
you O
could O
cover O
it O
in O
electrical O
tape O
if O
it O
annoys O
you O
) O

I O
needed O
a O
bigger O

With O
the O

( O

, O
I O
have O
a O

it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
one O
. O

Old O
7 O
year O
laptop O
and O
battery O
was O
discharged O
, O
now O
works O
perfect O
. O

After O
reading O
the O
reviews O
, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
reluctant O
to O
place O
the O
order O
because O
of O
the O
noise O
thing O
. O

It O
's O
expandable O
just O
by O
buying O

( O

: O

Of O
course O
, O
these O
adapters O
are O
not O
worth O
such O
a O
higher O
price O
; O
they O
are O
a O
profit O

making O

Even O
when O
my O

just O
sitting O
on O
a O

the O
feet O
on O
the O

are O
not O

pass O

( O
even O
if O

I O
will O
give O
an O
update O
in O

future O
for O

since O
i O
have O
owned O
this O

for O
only O
a O
week O

Better O
docs O
and O
packaging O
would O
make O
this O
a O
5-star O
product O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
because O
the O
device O
is O
running O
on O
a O
custom O
version O
of O

The O

Right O
before O
I O
made O
a O
purchase O
of O
nearly O
$ O
1000 O
, O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
this O
product O
and O
the O
price O
I O
said O
I O
had O
purchase O
the O
laptop O
. O

Its O
battery O
life O
is O
stunning O
. O

It O
can O
pay O
and O
charge O
simultaneously O
. O

( O
I O
used O
an O
older O
Kindle O
charger O
( O

) O
, O
which O
worked O
well O
without O
any O

, O
I O
give O
the O
Magic O

high O
marks O
for O
styling O
and O
appearance O
, O
good O
marks O
for O
sound O
if O
the O
volume O
is O

pushed O
too O
high O
, O
and O
high O
marks O
for O
excellent O
Bluetooth O
operation O

All O
around O
an O
excellent O
laptop O
, O
we O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

Awesome O
backup O
/ O
lifesaver O
. O

On O
the O
downside O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
the O
retina O
display O
, O
and O
the O
machine O
is O
n't O
silent O
- O
there O
's O
the O
fan O
and O
the O
rotating O
disk O
drive O
which O
makes O
a O
little O
noise O
when O
you O
tilt O
the O
machine O
. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance O
so O
far O
, O
hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
for O
some O
time O
. O

If O
the O
Mac O
were O
much O
better O
, O
I O
would O
keep O
that O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
battery O
life O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

They O
fit O
the O
booklets O
nicely O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
version O
without O
the O
USB O
port O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
install O
( O
with O
youtube O

help O
as O
there O
are O
no O
instructions O

WORKED O
FINE O
, O

What O
I O
could O
not O
suffer O
through O
was O
the O
very O
slow O
speed O
to O
the O
internet O
. O

For O
the O
true O
road O
warrier O
, O
you O
have O
to O
decide O
what O
's O
more O
important O
to O
you O
: O
( O
1 O
) O
a O
faster O
charge O
that O
this O
gives O
you O
; O
or O
( O
2 O
) O
saving O
a O
little O
weight O
and O
space O
in O
you O
bag O
. O

Much O
easier O
to O
type O
fast O
for O
me O
. O

A O
DEFINITE O
BUY O
! O

but O
I O
no O
longer O
travel O
with O
just O
one O
camera O
these O
days O
. O

This O
laptop O
really O
packs O
a O
punch O
! O

Um O
, O
MSW O
? O

The O
case O
I O
received O
is O
excellent O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
clean O
each O
key O
with O
rubbing O
alcohol O
real O
good O
before O
sticking O
the O
letters O
on O
or O
they O
wo O
n't O
stay O
on O
for O
long O
. O

I O
travel O
frequently O
with O
numerous O
electronics O
, O
and O
as O
one O

out O
many O
times O
there O
are O
n't O
exactly O
a O
lot O
of O
extra O
sockets O
in O
the O
hotel O
rooms O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
almost O
always O
transported O
in O
my O
backpack O
, O
so O
I O
just O
needed O
something O
to O
keep O
it O
clean O
. O

dem&aacute;s O

son O
muy O
espaciosos O
y O
& O

It O
was O
a O
pain O
to O
take O
off O
. O

Yeah O
, O
the O
having O
to O
preset O
stations O
is O
kind O
of O
annoying O
for O
road O

' O
, O
but O
not O
annoying O
enough O
to O
not O
give O
this O
product O
five O

I O
did O

Backups O
to O

are O
more O
likely O
to O
happen O
if O
you O
use O
a O

a O

I O
would O
definitely O
purchase O
again O
. O

This O
one O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
works O
very O
well O
. O

It O
also O
will O
display O
.DOC O
files O
instead O
of O
just O
the O
.TXT O
files O
. O

This O
is O
truly O
a O
great O
cable O
. O

This O
enclosure O
provides O
a O
simple O
way O
to O
make O
use O
of O
that O
internal O
drive O
that O
you O
replaced O
with O
an O
upgrade O
or O
salvaged O
from O
an O
retired O
computer O
. O

For O
those O
unfamiliar O
with O
Google O
's O
security O
services O
this O
involves O
Google O
sending O
a O
text O
message O
to O
my O
cell O

in O
order O
to O
authenticate O
my O
identity O
. O

Although O
this O

is O
designed O
for O
the O
MacBook O

's O
90 O

cable O
, O
the O
cable O
does O
touch O
an O
edge O
of O
the O
plastic O
shell O
that O
just O
ever O
so O
slightly O
causes O
the O
charging O
contacts O
not O
seated O
properly O
. O

I O
am O
thinking O
that O
the O
one O
I O
received O
was O
a O
lemon O
otherwise O
you O
would O
see O
numerous O
other O
reviewers O
commenting O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
this O
negates O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features O
of O
playing O
without O
an O
available O
outlet O
. O

There O
are O
other O
external O
drives O
out O
there O
that O
may O
cost O
a O
little O
more O
and O
have O
a O
better O
build O
quality O
, O
but O
this O
had O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
. O

And O
I O
hate O
wires O
! O

I O
seriously O
could O
n't O
imagine O
NOT O
having O
it O
. O

It O
does O
not O
leave O
streaks O
and O
the O
cleaning O
cloth O
is O
great O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O
! O

You O
'll O
notice O
that O
the O
up O
arrow O
key O
is O
just O
below O
theenter O
key O
. O

I O
moved O
my O
files O
over O
from O
my O
external O
hard O
drive O
, O
and O
in O
an O
hour O
I O
was O
fully O
up O
and O
running O
with O
everything O
I O
need O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
the O
various O
cables O
that O
you O
might O
need O
, O
including O
a O
HDMI O
mini O
cable O
that O
can O
be O
used O
with O
XA10 O
and O
others O
. O

but O
he O
does O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O
case O
with O
room O
for O
everything O
he O
needs O
to O
carry O
. O

BOTH O
fit O
inside O
! O

A O
careful O
look O
at O
the O
photo O
will O
show O
that O
the O
housing O
around O
the O
connector O
ends O
is O
a O
plastic O
that O
is O
simply O
glued O
together O
and O
not O
molded O
around O
the O
connections O
. O

Fast O
service O
. O

After O
we O
say O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
out O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
what O
it O
was O
I O
was O
buying O
, O
once O
I O
figured O
them O
out O
, O
they O
are O
cute O
. O

I O
was O
glad O
when O
I O
found O
this O
the O
price O
had O
come O
down O
so O
much O
. O

My O
hubby O
asked O
me O
to O
get O
a O
laptop O
for O
his O
wrestlers O
to O
use O
for O
school O
work O
while O
they O
are O
in O
practice O
so O
not O
to O
miss O
out O
on O
school O
work O
. O

Guess O
they O
want O
to O
sell O
you O
half O
the O
memory O
for O
same O
price O
. O

The O
keytops O
, O
like O
the O
body O
of O
the O
netbook O
, O
have O
a O
matte O
finish O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
fears O
were O
true O
the O
support O
left O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
and O
when O
the O
script O
they O
were O
reading O
from O
on O
things O
to O
try O
they O
gave O
up O
and O
told O
me O
the O
product O
was O
defective O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
looking O
sling O
pack O
. O

There O
was O
a O
little O
crapware O
to O
uninstall O
, O
nothing O
too O
annoying O
, O
but O
I O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
mention O
it O
, O
hopefully O
one O
day O
manufacturers O
will O
" O
get O
it O
" O
and O
stop O
pre O
- O
installing O
crap O
entirely O
? O

Built O
- O
in O
battery O
means O
you O
yourself O
can O
not O
replace O
it O
. O

It O
works O
with O
my O
13 O
" O
macbook O
pro O
2011 O
early O
model O
. O

I O
used O
this O
to O
amplify O
the O
headphone O
jack O
of O
a O
Nook O
tablet O

The O
MBP O
fired O
right O
up O
with O
an O
indicated O
60 O
% O
charge O
. O

Wow O
, O
so O
this O
is O
what O
a O
laser O
notebook O
mouse O
can O
be O
. O

The O
controls O
are O
simple O
and O
having O
it O
wake O
up O
with O
low O
volume O
is O
good O
design O
. O

I O
'd O
rather O
be O
safe O
than O
sorry O
. O

The O
product O
was O
certainly O
a O
bargain O
at O
the O
price O
; O
it O
just O
was O
n't O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

After O
all O
laptop O
manufacturers O
do O
n't O
adhere O
to O
some O
standard O
layout O
. O

Double O
Layer O
Superdrive O
- O
The O
Powerbook O
G4 O
now O
has O
superdrives O
( O
DVD O
burning O
capable O
) O
across O
the O
line O
. O

In O
short O
: O
This O
is O
not O
a O
DSLR O
bag O
. O

The O
stylus O
has O
had O
no O
issues O
so O
far O
and O
is O
greatly O
appreciated O
. O

Trackpad O
receives O
less O
praise O
from O
me O
. O

Both O
were O
tested O
on O
multiple O
Macs O
and O
multiple O
monitors O
. O

It O
's O
just O
plug O
n O
' O
play O
and O
unlike O
some O
other O
reviewers O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
noise O
at O
all O
coming O
from O
the O
fan O
on O
my O
pc O
or O
the O
drive O
itself O
. O

The O
only O
time O
I O
touch O
it O
is O
to O
switch O
it O
on O
. O

I O
agree O
they O
did O
something O
wrong O

it O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
, O

we O
'll O
never O
know O
) O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
, O
Lenovo O
has O
mediocre O
customer O
service O
and O
left O
MUCH O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

Switching O
PCs O
is O
completely O
smooth O
, O
with O
no O
delay O
or O
flakiness O
at O
all O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
a O
single O
crash O
. O

Card O
readers O
are O
generally O
lagging O
SD O
card O
development O
. O

If O
you O
know O
that O
you O
do O
not O
need O
or O
ever O
use O
a O
cd O
drive O
, O
purchase O
a O
net O
book O
. O

Would O
not O
recommend O
. O

The O
last O
four O
of O
my O
puters O
were O
Dell O
. O

The O
nice O
thing O
also O
is O
if O
I O
want O
I O
can O
leave O
the O
70 O
- O
200 O
on O
the O
camera O
. O

Hr O
agreed O
and O
then O
after O
being O
on O
hold O
for O
5 O
minutes O
he O
told O
me O
the O
system O
was O
down O

They O
should O
re O
- O
design O
the O
housing O
to O
have O
the O
correct O
slot O
sizes O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
held O
securely O
in O
its O
own O
padded O
area O
. O

For O
whatever O
reason O
, O
OS O
X O
10 O
. O
6 O
. O
7 O
has O
a O
minimum O
allowable O
bit O
rate O
for O
A2DP O
Bluetooth O
stereo O
audio O
so O
low O
as O
to O
render O
the O
resulting O
audio O
-profoundly- O
depressing O
. O

The O
small O
speakers O
sound O
excellent O
, O
even O
turned O
up O
loud O
, O
but O
the O
subwoofer O
needs O
to O
be O
turned O
way O
down O
at O
very O
high O
volumes O
, O
depending O
what O
surface O
it O
's O
on O
. O

Performance O
wise O
it O
works O
well O
[ O
thus O
far O
] O
but O
I O
really O
think O
a O
variable O
fan O
would O
have O
been O
a O
better O
idea O
versus O
no O
fan O
turning O
at O
all O
until O
the O
built O
in O
" O
sensor O
" O
detects O
that O
the O
system O
has O
exceeded O
40 O
% O
or O
better O
[ O
or O
quite O
possibly O
even O
a O
higher O
percentage O
] O
of O
a O
wattage O
load O
. O

It O
really O
makes O
the O
music O
sound O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

I O
was O
about O
to O
buy O
this O
on O
the O

( O
rhymes O
with O

) O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
feel O
the O
weight O

A O
trip O
to O
wal O
- O
mart O
, O
and O
some O
small O
gap O

, O
fixed O
that O
. O

I O
use O
it O
about O
10 O
hours O
/ O
day O
, O
5 O
days O
/ O
week O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
ideal O
home O
or O
dorm O
speaker O
- O
you O
can O
get O
better O
sound O
for O
half O
the O
price O
with O
a O
2 O

setup O
. O

This O
size O
bag O
holds O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
if O
the O
straps O
are O
n't O
super O
strong O
, O
all O
that O
weight O
would O
rip O
them O
out O
by O
the O
roots O
( O
which O
has O
happened O
to O
me O
before O
with O
lesser O
bags O
) O
. O

every O
thing O
looks O
sweet O

the O
second O
one O
I O
have O
near O
my O

to O
charge O
up O
my O
2 O
pairs O

. O

Even O
though O
the O
camera O
compartment O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
padding O
to O
safely O
store O
your O
camera O
. O

If O
you O
like O
to O
use O
your O
laptop O
on O
your O

, O
you O
will O
be O
happy O
with O
the O
Cool O

Works O
very O
well O
and O
is O
very O
convenient O
to O
carry O
on O
trips O
being O
so O
small O
. O

It O
also O
came O
with O
a O
multitude O
of O
apps O

choose O
from O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
anyone O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
and O
shipping O
service O
. O

I O
am O
using O
an O
Alienware O
backpack O
for O
oversized O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
does O
have O
a O
pocket O
for O
oversized O

or O
a O
cool O

. O

So O
go O
figure O
, O
I O
have O
had O
two O
batches O
of O
my O
own O
RAM O
fail O
and O
have O
to O
be O
returned O
, O
then O
my O
friend O
's O
computer O
also O
got O
a O
bad O
batch O
of O
this O
RAM O
, O
where O
it O
failed O
every O
legitimate O
test O
I O
gave O
it O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
so O
that O
had O
to O
be O
returned O
also O
.... O
a O
grand O
total O
of O
3 O
shipments O
of O
this O
Corsair O
RAM O
out O
of O
4 O
shipments O
that O
were O
bad O
, O
for O
one O
reason O
or O
another O
, O
so O
I O
am O
left O
with O
the O
inevitiable O
conclusion O
that O
this O
RAM O
is O
not O
to O
be O
trusted O
for O
1333Mhz O
RAM O
- O
dependent O
machines O
/ O
notebooks O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
good O
bet O
to O
try O
another O
brand O
perhaps O
: O
Kingston O
, O
Patriot O
, O
G. O
Skill O
( O
now O
is O
making O
notebook O
RAM O
) O
, O
or O
even O
Samsung O
/ O
Super O
Talent O
brands O
are O
all O
good O
, O
or O
shall O
I O
say O
BETTER O
choices O
than O
this O
Corsair O
RAM O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
great O
reviews O
you O
have O
read O
here O
. O

They O
installed O
quickly O
and O
do O
the O
job O
very O
well O
. O

I O
told O
them O
to O
keep O
the O
2 O
GB O
Sandisk O
Pro O
Duo O
as O
I O
had O
solved O
my O
Christmas O
present O
problem O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
process O
movies O
faster O
than O
my O
other O
Class O
6 O
Fuji O
card O
. O

I O
have O
plans O
to O
get O
wrist O
pads O
for O
longer O
sessions O
anyway O
, O
as O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
Mac O
itself O
can O
get O
uncomfortable O
after O
a O
while O
anyway O
. O

Hence O

held O

from O

inches O
to O
12 O
feet O
away O
, O
. O
pointed O

at O
the O
remote O
eye O
, O
. O

The O
PC O
recognizes O
it O
as O
the O
Fujitsu O
40 O
GB O
drive O
that O
it O
is O
, O
but O
that O
is O
all O
it O
will O
do O
. O

There O
is O
no O
visible O
performance O
difference O
between O

in O
this O

The O

is O
very O
bright O
. O

That O
is O
already O
bad O
but O
what O
really O
ticks O
me O
off O
is O
the O
poor O
customer O
service O
. O

The O
only O
real O
drawback O
, O
this O
laptop O
does O
not O
come O
with O
a O
DVD O
drive O

: O

The O
direct O
from O
MFG O
ones O
are O
far O
more O
expensive O
than O
this O
one O
. O

I O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
anybody O
who O
wants O
a O
extra O
Broadband O
connection O
at O
a O
affordable O
price O
for O
your O
computer O
. O

The O
first O
did O
n't O
transmit O
audio O
which O
was O
very O
disappointing O
. O

This O
usually O
happens O
when O
the O
bag O
is O
on O
a O
seat O
in O
my O
car O
, O
in O
the O
trunk O
, O
or O
even O
when O
the O
bag O
tips O
over O
at O
the O
bookstore O
, O
letting O
the O
Macbook O
go O
scattering O
across O
the O
tiled O
floor O
. O

This O
power O
supply O
for O
my O
Dell O
Latitude O
does O
supply O
power O
as O
intended O
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
grounding O
plug O
like O
the O
original O
equipment O
. O

Comparing O
Dish O
vs O
Directv O
programming O
, O
I O
feel O
DTV O
has O
one O
up O
on O
dish O
. O

I O
wanted O
the O
portability O
of O
the O
small O
size O
. O

The O
battery O
has O
worked O
well O
so O
far O
. O

It O
is O
small O
, O
and O
thin O
. O

I O
will O
buy O
another O
soon O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
abysmal O
customer O
support O
I O
am O
receiving O
from O
LaCie O
, O
I O
will O
not O
be O
purchasing O
any O
more O
of O
their O
products O
. O

You O
can O
see O
cables O
behind O
it O
from O
the O
front O
. O

I O
have O
an O
Asus O
RT O
- O
AC66R O
in O
my O
basement O
because O
that O
is O
where O
all O
the O
ethernet O
cabling O
terminates O
. O

If O
a O
skin O
- O
tight O
fit O
is O
of O
paramount O
importance O
to O
you O
, O
then O
you O
may O
or O
may O
not O
get O
that O
fit O
with O
a O
sleeve O
bought O
online O
. O

Below O
comments O
reflect O
my O
initial O
experience O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
which O
worked O
fine O
for O
a O
while O
. O

m O
not O
sure O
about O
third O
party O
anymore O
. O

Now O
my O
HP O
is O
the O
family O
's O
media O
center O
because O
the O
keyboard O
is O
so O
frustrating O
to O
type O
on O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
the O
SD O
card O
from O
your O
camera O
, O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
carry O
an O
external O
reader O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
endurance O
tested O
the O
battery O
or O
anything O
, O
but O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
run O
it O
down O
. O

INTRODUCTION O
~I O
got O
this O
product O
to O
be O
able O
to O
watch O
video O
from O
my O
computer O
on O
my O
tv O
. O

BUT O
, O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
the O
water O
- O
resistance O
, O
the O
price O
may O
be O
worth O
it O
to O
you O
. O

Very O
nice O
looking O
and O
adequate O
protection O
for O
carrying O
alone O
or O
in O
a O
bag O

Appears O
solidly O
built O
, O
the O
metal O
housing O
lends O
confidence O
. O

It O
may O
even O
enhance O
the O
resale O
value O
of O
my O
ultrabook O
. O

I O
keep O
touching O
it O
while O
I O
am O
typing O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
buttons O
on O
the O
side O
much O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
effectiveness O
. O

I O
use O
2 O
monitors O
when O
I O
'm O
home O
and O
it O
function O
well O
. O

It O
seems O
like O
the O
product O
is O
fine O
, O
but O
Windows O
XP O
just O
could O
n't O
deal O
with O
the O
upgrade O
. O

The O
well O
- O
made O
R-102 O
has O
many O
admirable O
design O
features O
but O
is O
padded O
to O
a O
fault O
. O

GPS O
signal O
will O
only O
update O
every O
30sec O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
disable O
the O
damn O
trackpad O
device O
from O
the O
device O
manager O
. O

Definitely O
but O
for O
the O
moment O
I O
am O
content O
with O
its O
performance O
. O

So O
I O
finished O
applying O
the O
protector O
and O
removed O
it O
so O
it O
would O
remove O
this O
dust O
. O

The O
four O
wire O
adapter O
that O
converts O
to O
the O
SATA O
input O
power O
has O
loose O
pins O
and O
was O
hard O
to O
get O
attached O
to O
the O
AC O
adapter O
. O

this O
camera O
takes O
just O
wonderful O
video O
but O
: O
it O
seems O
that O
in O
order O
to O
view O
the O
pictures O
on O
tv O
you O
must O
first O
buy O
a O
dvd O
recorder O
hw100 O
for O
$ O
177 O
. O
00 O

I O
ordered O
this O
just O
before O
Christmas O
and O
used O
it O
while O
preparing O
my O
1525 O
to O
be O
sold O
. O

These O
are O
really O
great O
especially O
since O
I O
sold O
my O
netbook O

This O
worked O
as O
advertised O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
, O
but O
has O
now O
developed O
a O
short O
in O
the O
mic O
connection O
. O

Adapter O
on O
Amazon O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
key O
board O
wire O
in O
the O
case O
. O

No O
booming O
bass O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
why O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

The O
25 O
, O
000:1 O
contrast O
ratio O
and O
auto O
- O
motion O
plus O
technology O
make O
the O
picture O
unreal O
. O

The O
cable O
works O
without O
any O
problem O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
her O
use O
the O
unit O
as O
a O
netbook O
then O
take O
the O
tablet O
off O

I O
shipped O
the O
same O
exact O
OEM O
product O
for O
around O
$ O
60 O
from O
Amazon O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
for O
the O
price O
. O

It O
took O
several O
hours O
of O
Google O
searching O
to O
find O
out O
that O
you O
have O
to O
manually O
set O
the O

as O

to O
make O
it O
work O

However O
, O
my O
external O

my O

worked O

only O
those O

I O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
choice O

Really O
nice O

for O

. O

This O
is O
the O
all O
- O
new O
- O
greatest O
version O
in O

I O
wish O
the O

latched O

And O
I O
have O
35 O
years O
of O

so O

I O

a O

This O

This O
works O
with O

I O
have O
with O

this O

the O

is O
, O
and O
it O
works O
a O
TREAT O
! O

excellent O
screen O
, O
and O
more O
features O
than O
needed O
for O
less O
than O
half O
the O
price O
of O
an O
iPad O
or O
android O
based O
tablet O
. O

the O
installation O
can O
be O
tricky O

Certainly O
better O
than O
the O
speakers O
in O
the O
laptop O
( O
MB O
and O
MBA O
) O
, O
and O
quite O
small O
and O
portable O
. O

But O
the O
big O
selling O
point O
really O
is O
the O
sound O
. O

It O
has O
to O
be O
there O
to O
be O
accessed O
while O
in O
tablet O
mode O
. O

Did O
notice O
that O
all O
other O
devices O
should O
be O
disconnected O
before O
an O
update O
. O

Bluetooth O
Music O
Receiverand O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

This O
did O
not O
improve O
things O
. O

It O
is O
a O
product O
where O
you O
are O
able O
to O
watch O
live O
tv O
. O

Well O
made O
, O
rugged O
. O

The O
weight O
is O
also O
very O
impressive O
at O
2 O
. O

This O
way O
I O
can O
store O
most O
of O
my O
mp3s O
and O
some O
movies O
for O
traveling O
;) O

and O
I O
came O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
just O
sending O
it O
back O
. O

It O
had O
been O
working O
nicely O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
. O

Light O
bag O
for O
your O
little O
netbook O
. O

The O
speakers O
, O
as O
some O
other O
reviews O
pointed O
out O
, O
do O
not O
seem O
to O
put O
out O
as O
much O
sound O
/ O
volume O
as O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
. O

It O
is O
light O
but O
sturdy O
enough O
to O
protect O
everything O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
another O
Windows O
machine O
for O
my O
next O
laptop O
, O
I O
really O
did O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
find O
annoying O
when O
working O
with O
the O
glossy O
screen O
are O
reflections O
. O

The O
smaller O
ditty O
bag O
is O
a O
good O
size O
to O
hold O
the O
charger O
and O
mouse O
I O
often O
carry O
. O

does O
nt O
even O
get O
warm O
... O

I O
bought O
this O
power O
cord O
( O
complete O
set O
) O
several O
months O
ago O
and O
is O
still O
working O
beautifully O
. O

I O
've O
had O
no O
problems O
connecting O
and O
disconnecting O
. O

Checked O
out O
my O
router O
, O
cable O
, O
drivers O
, O
called O
Samsung O
6 O
times O
( O
they O
are O
available O
24x7 O
) O
but O
were O
not O
really O
helpful O
, O
went O
to O
the O
Intel O
site O
and O
pulled O
the O
newest O
drivers O
since O
Samsung O
did O
not O
have O
them O
, O
rebooted O
many O
times O
and O
the O
connection O
lasted O
10 O
minutes O
, O
20 O
minutes O
, O
5 O
minutes O
..... O

Hook O
this O
puppy O
into O
your O
mac O
and O
there O
you O
go- O

It O
could O
use O
more O
memory O
but O
since O
everyone O
should O
have O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
anyway O
for O
backing O
up O
files O
, O
that O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
problem O
. O

The O
battery O
lasts O
about O
5 O
hours O
which O
is O
pretty O
good O
for O
a O
laptop O
this O
size O
and O
speed O
. O

It O
may O
or O
may O
not O
protect O
it O
because O
the O
jarring O
is O
likely O
what O
would O
damage O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

These O
speakers O
are O
incredible O
. O

/ac O
( O
you O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
to O
your O
computer O
instead O

I O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
pictures O
and O
sometimes O
I O
'm O
constraint O
by O
space O
on O
my O
bag O
. O

has O
decent O
battery O
life O
and O
feels O
durable O
... O
which O
is O
what O
you O
want O
on O
machines O
like O
this O
. O

Our O
first O
battery O
wore O
out O
after O
16 O
months O
and O
we O
were O
disappointed O
but O
considering O
the O
cost O
we O
were O
n't O
too O
surprised O
. O

The O
reason O
I O
only O
give O
3 O
stars O
is O
that O
the O
cables O
are O
somewhat O
unreliable O
. O

Turns O
them O
into O
a O
very O
inexpensive O
, O
but O
good O
quality O
multipurpose O
usb O
/ O
lightning O
cable O
. O

The O
little O
stands O
on O
the O
bottom O
is O
weak O
but O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
and O
the O
case O
cover O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
I O
just O
let O
it O
go O
to O
sleep O
, O
in O
between O
using O
the O
system O
at O
home O
and O
at O
work O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
now O
and O
have O
to O
say O
it O
is O
not O
what O
I O
expected O
. O

Some O
funny O
gelly O
feeling O
while O
typing O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
remember O
what O
version O
of O
Windows O
was O
on O
the O
last O
PC O
I O
owned O
, O
so O

Does O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
- O
sends O
an O
HDMI O
signal O
wirelessly O
, O
with O
zero O
setup O
required O
beyond O
just O
plugging O
in O
power O
and O
HDMI O
, O
and O
letting O
the O
two O
devices O
discover O
each O
other O
. O

My O
only O
gripe O
, O
and O
the O
reason O
I O
'm O
taking O
away O
one O
star O
, O
is O
that O
the O
battery O
compartment O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
pain O
to O
open O
... O
clearer O
instructions O
would O
've O
been O
extremely O
helpful O
. O

And O
this O
feature O
is O
really O
, O
really O
important O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
charging O
multiple O
devices O
all O
the O
time O
, O
you O
know O
you O
can O
count O
on O
those O
extra O
hours O
if O
you O
get O
stuck O
somewhere O
in O
the O
boonies O
where O
you O
ca O
n't O
charge O
it O
. O

Until O
then O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
carry O
my O
tablet O
around O
in O
it O
. O

No O
issues O
to O
report O
, O
the O
build O
quality O
is O
typical O
of O
any O
cable O
. O

I O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
I O
ended O
up O
buying O
another O
one O
. O

I O
'm O
taking O
my O
time O
, O
switching O
between O
the O
G13 O
and O
my O
G11 O
keyboard O
. O

Wired O
( O
ethernet O
) O
speed O
on O
a O
Windows O
7 O
64 O
bit O
PC O
Comcast O
Internet O
on O
speedtest O
. O

Usually O
it O
ends O
up O
almost O
around O
your O
neck O
. O

Lenses O
- O
if O
you O
own O
your O
set O
of O
micro O
4/3 O
lenses O
, O
great O
! O

Okay O
the O
price O
was O
the O
incentive O
here O
. O

I O
am O
getting O
ready O
to O
replace O
two O
Dell O
desktops O
at O
my O
business O
and O
really O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
with O
Windows O
8 O
since O
it O
's O
more O
of O
a O
device O
/ O
tablet O
operating O
system O
. O

It O
works O
great O
! O

Delivery O
was O
fast O
, O
Amazon O
usually O
is O
great O
at O
that O
. O

This O
could O
be O
because O
there O
were O
two O
concrete O
block O
walls O
between O
PC O
and O
router O
and O
the O
distance O
was O
100 O
+ O
feet O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
to O
use O
on O
a O
desk O
primarily O
, O
this O
is O
perfect O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
item O
, O
it O
arrived O
on O
time O
and O
looked O
just O
great O
. O

All O
in O
all O
and O
as O
so O
many O
others O
have O
posted O
here O
, O
this O
is O
an O
outstanding O
HDTV O
that O
not O
only O
has O
an O
incredible O
picture O
, O
but O
it O
also O
looks O
fantastic O
in O
my O
house O
. O

It O
is O
ipod O
type O
size O
and O
the O
push O
buttons O
are O
easy O
to O
get O
, O
although O
perhaps O
a O
touch O
sensitive O
. O

I O
have O
traveled O
and O
used O
heavily O
at O
home O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sound O
seems O
to O
disappear O
about O
90 O
% O
when O
on O
A O
/ O
C O
instead O
of O
battery O
. O

Had O
it O
for O
about O
two O
days O
now O
, O
and O
does O
what O
it O
supposed O
to O
. O

Another O
enclosure O
worked O
fine O
. O

I O
just O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
bit O
more O
room O
--enough O
for O
my O
portfolio O
of O
papers O
. O

Had O
it O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
no O
problems O
what O
so O
ever O
. O

I O
love O
the O
size O
, O
love O
the O
color O
and O
find O
it O
perfect O
to O
use O
at O
work O
. O

hi O
ho O

This O
item O
does O
NOT O
work O
with O
Cruz O
Tablet O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
the O
ThinkPad O
that O
my O
school O
gives O
to O
each O
teacher O
to O
use O
throughout O
the O
year O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
super O
easy O
, O
worked O
great O
! O

I O
received O
one O
notification O
that O
the O
problem O
was O
resolved O
only O
to O
find O
that O
my O
account O
was O
still O
showing O
that O
I O
was O
maxed O
out O
on O
the O
key O
requests O
. O

Obviously O
, O
there O
are O
going O
to O
be O
some O
sacrifices O
required O
to O
create O
a O
unit O
that O
is O
both O
small O
and O
affordable O
. O

Just O
look O
at O
the O
reviews O
, O
they O
are O
written O
by O
the O
same O
person O
. O

These O
are O
cleverly O
packaged O
with O
a O
bass O
- O
reflex O
vent O
on O
a O
down O
and O
away O
sloping O
top O
, O
that O
is O
out O
of O
sight O
. O

This O
should O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

11 O
g O
, O
which O
uses O
RTL8188SU O
. O

I O
still O
do O
the O
majority O
of O
my O
work O
with O
the O
mouse O
and O
just O
switch O
to O
the O
pen O
for O
things O
that O
work O
better O
when O
using O
it O
. O

Upgraded O
to O
700 O
T O
, O
really O
loved O
the O
tablet O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
's O
that O
bad O
... O

I O
needed O
this O
cable O
for O
my O
wife O
's O
kindle O
fire O
. O

Installing O
the O
memory O
is O
easy O
- O
takes O
5 O
minutes O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
'd O
never O
buy O
a O
Sony O
DVD O
recorder O
due O
to O
Sony O
's O
fanaticism O
about O
copy O
protection O
and O
recording O
TV O
programs O
. O

Storage O
is O
abundant O
, O
the O
security O
cable O
is O
well O
placed O
and O
the O
zipper O
pockets O
are O
large O
. O

As O
many O
other O
people O
have O
said O
, O
this O
product O
is O
a O
high O
quality O
speaker O
set O
in O
a O
small O
package O
that O
is O
for O
the O
most O
part O
easy O
and O
convenient O
to O
use O
. O

It O
's O
important O
to O
note O
that O
I O
currently O
do O
not O
have O
any O
HD O
input O
- O
just O
the O
standard O
cable O
signal O
and O
Wii O
via O
composite O
cables O
. O

Material O
/ O
padding O
is O
thinner O
than O
the O
15 O
inch O
pack O
I O
had O
from O
the O
same O
manufacturer O
( O
SYNERGY O
model O
I O
think O
) O
. O

It O
weighed O
a O
ton O
, O
wobbled O
, O
an O
all O
around O
pain O
. O

Laptops O
are O
used O
outdoors O
sometimes O
- O
and O
that O
means O
huge O
glares O
on O
a O
glossy O
screen O
. O

For O
many O
( O
if O
not O
most O
) O
folks O
purchasing O
either O
one O
of O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
13 O
" O
models O
, O
$ O
1200 O
to O
$ O
1500 O
will O
represent O
a O
significant O
investment O
and O
a O
choice O
you O
'll O
likely O
want O
to O
/ O
need O
to O
live O
with O
for O
some O
time O
-- O
even O
if O
it O
turns O
- O
out O
to O
not O
be O
the O
best O
choice O
. O

There O
is O
enough O
space O
for O
storage O
of O
some O
things O

The O
current O
word O
says O
the O
Transformer O
Prime O
tablet O
will O
launch O
November O
9th O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
only O
item O
Asus O
has O
in O
mind O
to O
launch O
. O

Netbook O
comes O
with O
free O
, O
61-day O
protection O
, O
but O
I O
hate O
having O
to O
pay O
and O
update O
protection O
all O
the O
time O
. O

But O
believe O
me O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
harsh O
words O
if O
they O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
for O
s O

now O
, O
i O
can O
leave O
my O
ac O
adapter O
at O
home O
when O
i O
go O
to O
the O
coffee O
shops O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
would O
change O
would O
be O
the O
zippers O
. O

The O
old O
battery O
gave O
me O
around O
3 O
hours O
, O
so O
while O
it O
is O
n't O
double O
, O
it O
does O
last O
longer O
. O

She O
says O
it O
works O
great O
, O
giving O
her O
back O
the O
original O
battery O
life O
she O
had O
with O
the O
original O
battery O
. O

This O
mic O
did O
the O
trick O
and O
provided O
good O
quality O
sound O
while O
limiting O
environmental O
noise O
( O
as O
reported O
from O
my O
meeting O
partners O
) O
. O

Basically O
you O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
walk O
through O
the O
prompts O
to O
back O
up O
a O
directory O
, O
it O
's O
only O
a O
couple O
of O
gigs O
so O
you O
have O
to O
choose O
carefully O
( O
like O
a O
class O
folder O
or O
presentation O
folder O
, O
this O
thing O
wo O
n't O
come O
close O
to O
backing O
up O
My O
Documents O
) O
. O

That O
's O
an O
important O
distinction O
in O
an O
HP O
laptop O
. O

However O
, O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
that O
the O
" O
back O
- O
side O
" O
of O
the O
bag O
is O
nylon O
-- O
the O
side O
shown O
in O
the O
picture O
that O
fits O
over O
the O
handle O
of O
a O
suitcase O
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
the O
good O
. O

i O
backed O
up O
all O
my O
info O
on O
a O
backup O
hard O
drive O
and O
guess O
what O
my O
laptop O
went O
our O
days O
later O
... O
take O
god O
for O
the O
backup O
is O
had O
... O

This O
is O
a O
good O
radio O
but O
it O
is O
expensive O
. O

I O
can O
update O
my O
Windows O
as O
well O

I O
've O
read O
that O
we O
should O
n't O
expect O
much O
more O
in O
the O
way O
of O
price O
reductions O
this O
year O
, O
and O
I O
suspect O
that O
the O
sharp O
increase O
in O
oil O
prices O
and O
drop O
in O
the O
dollar O
may O
actually O
drive O
prices O
up O
for O
imported O
goods O
like O
this O
. O

Would O
it O
satisfy O
any O
normal O
user O
? O

Battery O
then O
showed O
no O
lights O
. O

I O
've O
got O
a O
10 O
" O
Toshiba O
player O
and O
it O
's O
a O
tight O
fit O
in O
this O
case O
, O
but O
it O
does O
fit O
. O

It O
only O
has O
a O
couple O
of O
large O
, O
general O
purpose O
pockets O
. O

You O
failed O
me O
so O
completely O
. O

I O
tried O
reconnecting O
and O
recharging O
but O
nothing O
worked O
. O

Works O
great O
for O
me O
. O

The O
adapter O
is O
very O
well O
designed O
and O
built O
. O

Also O
, O
left O
and O
right O
clicks O
will O
go O
much O
faster O
this O
way O

The O
battery O
that O
came O
with O
my O
iBook O
was O
made O
in O
China O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
OUYA O
, O
nice O
little O
keyboard O
. O

It O
seems O
like O
a O
good O
case O
if O
you O
're O
rough O
with O
your O
Nook O
, O
but O
it O
's O
ridiculously O
large O
if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
throw O
it O
in O
a O
purse O
or O
backpack O
. O

It O
came O
in O
handy O
, O
and O
for O
the O
price O
, O
I O
should O
have O
bought O
another O
one O
. O

I O
did O
notice O
that O
when O
using O
the O
cooling O
pad O
that O
the O
battery O
life O
of O
the O
laptop O
dropped O
substantially O
so O
it O
was O
only O
really O
viable O
to O
use O
if O
/ O
when O
the O
laptop O
is O
plugged O
into O
a O
charger O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
sense O
of O
humor O
the O
" O
Instruction O
Manual O
" O
had O
some O
very O
amusing O
elements O
. O

Obviously O
this O
battery O
works O
well O
for O
other O
models O
, O
and O
it O
may O
just O
be O
a O
fluke O
in O
the O
construction O
of O
this O
particular O
battery O
( O
I O
see O
other O
reviews O
where O
the O
buyer O
had O
my O
same O
model O
laptop O
and O
no O
apparent O
issues O
inserting O
the O
battery O
) O
. O

I O
would O
still O
recommend O
due O
to O
price O
and O
quick O
shipping O
. O

Running O
a O
speed O
test O
, O
at O
about O
30 O
ft O
away O
, O
I O
only O
lost O
about O
0 O
. O

I O
also O
was O
surprised O
at O
how O
well O
the O
FM O
radio O
works O
. O

It O
is O
doing O
the O
most O
important O
things O
on O
my O
checklist O
and O
more O
and O
more O
! O

I O
can O
not O
tell O
the O
difference O
in O
speed O
; O
however O
, O
it O
is O
NOT O
good O
for O
playing O
games O
. O

For O
the O
more O
adventurous O
souls O
out O
there O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
stand O
alone O
copy O
of O
windows O
vista O
, O
WIPE O
THE O
SYSTEM O
AND O
REINSTALL O
! O

I O
just O
installed O
the O
Corsair O
Vengeance O
kit O
in O
the O
E420 O

I O
had O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
a O
previous O
Logitech O
headset O
in O
the O
same O
style O
. O

Congratulations O
to O
Amazon O
and O
their O
representative O
for O
quick O
action O
. O

Very O
cool O
to O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

I O
no O
longer O
use O
these O
speakers O
as O
I O
noticed O
it O
really O
does O
n't O
make O
the O
sound O
any O
louder O
if O
it O
is O
quiet O
. O

I O
move O
my O
laptop O
from O
my O
desk O
to O
my O
bedroom O
with O
the O
cooling O
pad O
, O
all O
within O
the O
space O
of O
my O
bedroom O
. O

My O
wife O
wanted O
a O
case O
and O
stand O
for O
the O
tablet O
our O
grandson O
gave O
her O
for O
Christmas O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
will O
fit O
everything O
short O
of O
the O
kitchen O
sink O
! O

The O
fit O
is O
perfect O
and O
it O
looks O
nice O
. O

If O
you O
got O
one O
that O
works O
as O
described O
, O
then O
it O
's O
still O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

This O
roller O
attracts O
many O
of O
my O
co O
- O
workers O
, O
fashion O
and O
femineity O
. O

If O
your O
thinking O
about O
playing O
a O
song O
on O
itunes O
, O
while O
browsing O
the O
web O
.... O
GUESS O
AGAIN O
! O

6 O
Dell O
almost O
perfectly O
, O
with O
just O
a O
bit O
of O
overhang O
on O
either O
side O
. O

This O
laptop O
definitely O
was O
designed O
with O
travelers O
in O
mind O
. O

The O
only O
take O
on O
this O
one O
though O
is O
that O
it O
is O
little O
overpriced O
IMO O
, O
it O
should O
be O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
12 O
but O
that O
's O
totally O
fine O
as O
long O
as O
it O
works O
completely O
fine O
especially O
for O
servers O
that O
do O
n't O
have O
their O
NIC O
supported O
by O
Linux O
, O
or O
those O
that O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
fiddling O
before O
getting O
it O
to O
work O
--&#62 O
; O
having O
the O
server O
connected O
eases O
a O
lot O
of O
downloading O
/ O
configuration O
and O
module O
's O
installation O
references O

and O
it O
's O
also O
dimmable O
. O

The O
cost O
of O
cards O
has O
come O
WAY O
down O
. O

I O
am O
a O
part O
time O
wedding O
photographer O
and O
avid O
computer O
hobbyist O
. O

I O
suppose O
it O
could O
be O
used O
for O
charging O
only O
, O
but O
you O
will O
still O
have O
to O
remove O
the O
ipod O
from O
any O
protective O
case O
. O

But O
I O
have O
surely O
noticed O
that O
this O
one O
does O
get O
hot O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
clip O
... O
it O
is O
magnetic O
. O

It O
perfectly O
suits O
to O
my O
dell O
N5010 O
laptop O
. O

and O
it O
has O
kept O
the O
contents O
dry.- O

I O
have O
continued O
to O
compare O
and O
I O
can O
not O
find O
anything O
that O
can O
beat O
it O
for O
total O
overall O
value O
. O

A O
new O
dialog O
box O
- O
Speaker O
Properties O
- O
opens O
up.- O

The O
speakers O
are O
pretty O
loud O
and O
I O
am O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
the O
sound O
. O

When O
the O
box O
was O
printed O
, O
the O
largest O
drives O
commonly O
available O
were O
1 O
TB O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
sits O
so O
low O
in O
the O
bag O
that O
most O
of O
it O
is O
n't O
easiliy O
accessible O
while O
it O
's O
in O
the O
bag O
. O

This O
battery O
's O
no O
exception O
, O
fits O
with O
no O
fuss O
! O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
get O
a O
graphics O
card O
that O
can O
support O
two O
monitors O
. O

and O
I O
found O
my O
Chromebook O
actually O
getting O
better O
all O
the O
time O
rather O
than O
slowly O
fall O
into O
obsolescence O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
different O
border O
, O
the O
front O
of O
the O
computer O
looks O
like O
it O
has O
a O
square O
on O
it O
. O

Mouse O
is O
jumpy O
and O
cursor O
travels O
/ O
roams O
when O
left O
stationary O
. O

There O
is O
both O
a O
handle O
and O
a O
shoulder O
carrying O
strap O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
learn O
about O
improving O
Vista O
performance O
just O
do O
a O
Google O
search O
for O
" O
Vista O
tweaks O
. O

and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
make O
it O
work O
, O
but O
so O
far O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
do O
that O
. O

The O
good O
: O
I O
feel O
that O
the O
case O
does O
a O
good O
job O
at O
protecting O
my O
Retina O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

These O
knockoffs O
never O
perform O
the O
same O
. O

With O
this O
new O
battery O
, O
when O
the O
power O
is O
low O
enough O
for O
the O
screen O
to O
turn O
dark O
, O
the O
computer O
is O
off O
. O

The O
first O
one O
I O
ordered O
I O
really O
liked O
. O

It O
works O
properly O
with O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
a O
mouse O
would O
fit O
in O
there O
, O
though O
... O

18 O
- O
55 O
mm O
kit O
lens5 O
) O

I O
needed O
a O
mechanism O
that O
would O
keep O
my O
docked O
laptop O
displaying O
even O
when O
the O
company O
required O
30 O
minutes O
without O
keyboard O
action O
came O
along O
, O
because O
I O
used O
the O
docked O
laptop O
to O
watch O
processes O
while O
desktop O
was O
where O
I O
worked O
. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
professional O
reviewers O
writing O
glowing O
reviews O
about O
the O
Prime O
. O

did O
I O
mention O
that O
I O
hated O
the O
keyboard?).Leading O
up O
to O
this O
purchase O
, O
I O
have O
gone O
through O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
, O
most O
recently O
an O
Acer O
netbook O
( O
which O
finally O
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
thus O
leading O
to O
this O
purchase O
) O
, O
and O
an O
iPad O
mini O
with O
Bluetooth O
keyboard O
. O

so O
i O
came O
on O
amazon O
and O
put O
in O
the O
model O
number O
that O
was O
on O
my O
charger O
and O
this O
poped O
upso O

I O
really O
like O
this O
and O
your O
kids O
should O
be O
happy O
with O
it O
also O
. O

Although O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
, O
it O
has O
a O
port O

Tried O
unistall O
and O
reinstall O
... O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
case O
and O
keyboard O
for O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
price O
of O
others O
. O

I O
still O
works O
flawlessly O
. O

Two O
men O
brought O
it O
in O
put O
it O
on O
my O
TV O
stand O
and O
even O
plugged O
it O
in O
! O

The O
cable O
is O
about O
1/2 O
thickness O
of O
Kensington O
's O
. O

But O
, O
to O
me O
, O
at O
this O
price O
, O
this O
is O
not O
big O
deal O
. O

I O
need O
to O
transfer O
anything O
from O
my O
computer O
to O
my O
phone O
or O
visa O
versa O

When O
I O
've O
done O
step O
6 O
and O
7 O
the O
second O
time O
I O
've O
had O
to O
choose O
the O
option O
to O
activate O
windows O
now O
and O
that O
worked O
fine O
. O

Edit O
: O
I O
should O
add O
that O
I O
have O
been O
vehemently O
opposed O
to O
buying O
Samsung O
products O
because O
of O
a O
bad O
experience O
with O
an O
expensive O
video O
camera O
and O
terrible O
customer O
service O
that O
left O
me O
with O
nothing O
, O
but O
the O
specs O
on O
this O
device O
still O
pulled O
me O
in O
. O

/whatever O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
it O
tucked O
away O
nicely O
. O

It O
might O
work O
better O
if O
it O
was O
closer O
, O
though O
. O

The O
extent O
to O
which O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
recalibrate O
with O
built O
- O
in O
controls O
is O
limited O
though O
, O
so O
I O
still O
need O
to O
investigate O
options O
here O
. O

I O
was O
trying O
to O
film O
a O
voice O
interview O
in O
Second O
Life O
but O
could O
n't O
get O
usable O
audio O
consistently O
. O

Complete O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

They O
suggest O
you O
could O
get O
20 O
hours O
of O
playtime O
from O
a O
set O
of O
batteries O
. O

4 O
secure O
digital O
cards O
, O
3 O
batteries O
for O
the O
D60 O
and O
its O
charger O
and O
cleaning O
supplies O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
excellent O
as O
well O
and O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
4 O
reviews O
. O

With O
just O
a O
dual O
core O
processor O
, O
I O
am O
surprised O
at O
its O
speed O
. O

It O
is O
bulky O
but O
possibly O
required O
for O
the O
type O
of O
equipment O
it O
will O
house O
. O

I O
totally O
recommend O
this O
one O
! O

rec'd O
product O
as O
described O
by O
the O
store O
owner O
but O
once O
tried O
it O
would O
n't O
accept O
sd O
or O
micro O
sd O
cards O
, O
the O
radio O
could O
n't O
hold O
stations O
and O
the O
speakers O
never O
played O
consistently O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
looking O
for O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

These O
are O
crisp O
( O
not O
harsh O
or O
tinny O
) O
, O
well O
- O
defined O
and O
free O
of O
noticeable O
peaks O
( O
or O
troughs O
) O

I O
purchased O
this O
mainly O
so O
that O
I O
could O
plug O
in O
one O
of O
my O
larger O
amperage O
USB O
chargers O
and O
plug O
in O
my O
Phone O
, O
My O
Camera O
, O
My O
waterproof O
VIdeo O
camera O
ETC O
. O

With O
bluetooth O
streaming O
on O
the O
transfer O
dropped O
to O
400 O
kbps O
and O
lower O
. O

Picked O
up O
a O
signal O
quick O

If O
you O
need O
more O
volume O
, O
just O
slide O
the O
power O
button O
to O
ON O
and O
the O
sound O
fills O
a O
17 O
' O
x O
15 O
' O
room O

You O
can O
drop O
this O
thing O
, O
put O
things O
on O
it O
, O
leave O
it O
running O
948290 O
applications O
and O
spill O
stuff O
all O
over O
it O

The O
cover O
latches O
very O
securely O
. O

I O
could O
of O
bought O
a O
generic O
laptop O
, O
loaded O
a O
striped O
down O
version O
of O
linux O
with O
just O
a O
browser O
, O

And O
by O
barely O
, O
I O
mean O
there O
is O
maybe O
an O
inch O
of O
wiggle O
room O
to O
zip O
the O
laptop O
in O
. O

The O
laptop O
seems O
to O
be O
upgradeable O
. O

Great O
Battery O
life O
, O
fast O
processor O
, O
great O
graphics O
, O
keyboard O
is O
sized O
right O
and O
the O
price O
is O
acceptable O
. O

Does O
n't O
get O
too O
hot O
. O

Being O
a O
small O
camera O
, O
it O
should O
have O
a O
small O
bag O
with O
it O
. O

I O
have O
it O
in O
black O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
black O
laptop O
when O
the O
apple O
is O
not O
shining O
. O

Screen O
is O
bright O
and O
very O
clear O
. O

, O
I O
was O
not O
predisposed O
to O
either O
platform O
. O

Note O
first O
that O
the O

listed O

is O
wrong O
. O

I O
've O
had O
trouble O
with O
a O
couple O
phones O
on O
this O
cable O
because O
the O
tips O
are O
so O
bulky O
, O
so O
it O
ca O
n't O
get O
all O
the O
way O
in O
and O
the O
sound O
is O
n't O
as O
good O
. O

and O
you O
'll O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
space O
. O

After O
this O
dual O
layer O
DVD O
drives O
were O
introduced O
and O
then O
finally O
Blue O
Ray O
drives O
. O

Got O
it O
for O
my O
son O
. O

Careful O
buying O
this O
item O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
factor O
in O
to O
this O
review O
. O

Since O
my O
replacement O
cable O
for O
the O
blown O
- O
up O
adapter O
was O
not O
long O
enough O
, O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
longer O
power O
- O
cord O
for O
hotel O
stays O
. O

The O
case O
allowed O
me O
to O
place O
the O
iPad O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
type O
in O
both O
landscape O
and O
portrait O
positions O
, O
though O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
unstable O
in O
the O
portrait O
configuration O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
became O
more O
top O
heavy O
. O

After O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
use O
, O
both O
the O
mouse O
and O
keyboard O
will O
stop O
working O
and O
I O
have O
to O
unplug O
the O
adapter O
from O
the O
USB O
port O
and O
plug O
it O
back O
in O
, O
which O
forces O
it O
to O
reestablish O
a O
connection O
with O
both O
devices O
. O

The O
plug O
adapters O
arrived O
on O
time O
and O
worked O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
also O
like O
that O
option O
. O

I O
've O
toyed O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
buying O
a O
Timbuk2 O
for O
a O
long O
time O
now O
and O
just O
never O
pulled O
the O
trigger O
. O

Very O
sleek O
well O
made O
. O

- O
I O
tried O
out O
a O
variety O
of O
music O
from O
some O
Disney O
kids O
songs O
to O
some O
Pop O
Music O
to O
Excision O
Bass O
Heavy O
Dubstep O
( O
the O
Destroid O
album O
) O
, O
and O
the O
speaker O
handled O
everything O
I O
threw O
at O
it O
with O
no O
distortion O
and O
some O
pretty O
high O
volumes O
. O

Another O
great O
feature O
is O
the O
ability O
to O
turn O
on O
the O
backlight O
for O
use O
in O
a O
dark O
room O
. O

I O
was O
happy O
that O
this O
model O
was O
able O
to O
fit O
my O
old O
60W O
MagSafe O
Power O
Adapter O
and O
my O
85W O
MagSafe O
as O
well O
. O

so O
its O
easy O
to O
match O
to O
what O
your O
doing O
. O

it O
's O
thereCharging- O
Fully O
charges O
( O

I O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
, O

The O
traveler O
's O
creed O
- O
carry O
less O
, O
go O
lighter O
and O
simpler O
! O

I O
love O
the O
touch O
screen O
ability O
at O
such O
a O
modest O
price O
though O
I O
am O
a O
power O
keyboard O
user O
, O
and O
love O
the O
small O
light O
, O
though O
well O
built O
feel O
. O

After O
a O
google O
I O
got O
it O
to O
work O
. O

I O
do O
use O
the O
Ultrabook O
on O
a O
hard O
surface O
like O
a O
desk O
or O
table O
, O
per O
the O
instructions O
. O

One O
thing O
that O
reduced O
my O
rating O
by O
one O
star O
is O
the O
length O
of O
the O
USB O
cable O
- O
it O
seems O
shorter O
than O
the O
average O
cable O
. O

It O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
ereader O
, O
is O
portable O
, O
and O
solid O
with O
a O
heavy O
rubberized O
case O
. O

I O
definitely O
recommend O
Logitech O
and O
these O
great O
speakers O
. O

It O
looks O
professional O
& O
practical O
. O

The O
only O
negative O
reviews O
worth O
considering O
are O
from O
people O
who O
received O
duds O
that O
never O
worked O
or O
worked O
only O
once O
. O

This O
Orico O
BT O
Dongle O
would O
not O
install O
and O
pair O
with O
the O
included O
CD O
. O

Lightweight O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

They O
are O
lightweight O
and O
I O
find O
the O
batteries O
hold O
a O
decent O
charge O
. O

I O
've O
had O
no O
problems O
so O
far O
. O

All O
of O
these O
drives O
worked O
perfect O
. O

it O
comes O
loose O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
bottom O
cover O
has O
a O
lip O
that O
extends O
about O
1 O
mm O
above O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
actual O
MacBook O
Pro O
edge O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
little O
uncomfortable O
for O
my O
wrists O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
keep O
it O
on O
for O
longer O
typing O
sessions O
. O

I O
assumed O
most O
of O
the O
reviews O
would O
be O
from O
confirmed O
Mac O
users O
, O
but O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
most O
were O
like O
me O
, O
converts O
from O
Windows O
. O

I O
am O
one O
who O
had O
enjoyed O
polaroid O
over O
the O
years O
. O

It O
lasts O
30 O
minutes O
. O

some O
people O
have O
to O
turn O
off O
bluetooth O
to O
get O
wifi O
to O
connect- O

The O
touchscreen O
is O
great O
when O
you O
need O
to O
scroll O
pages O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
sturdy O
but O
definately O
not O
waterproof O
( O
there O
is O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
back O
to O
allow O
for O
the O
monitor O
base O
) O
but O
it O
is O
better O
than O
carrying O
the O
monitor O
in O
the O
box O
it O
came O
in O
! O

It O
works O
very O
well O
in O
my O
car O
because O
the O
coil O
keeps O
it O
easy O
to O
manage O
while O
providing O
the O
ability O
to O
stretch O
as O
needed O
. O

Tell O
me O
what O
could O
be O
better O
then O
that O
? O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
have O

Bottom O

But O
I O
imagine O
that O
for O
those O
who O
really O
care O
about O
using O
this O
computer O
for O
chatting O
or O
music O
listening O
will O
have O
headsets O
and/or O
headphones O
for O
these O
things O
. O

For O
being O
so O
inexpensive O
, O
I O
really O
was O
n't O
expecting O
much O
, O
but O
this O
little O
mouse O
has O
really O
impressed O
me O

you O
can O

So O
simple O

the O

made O
me O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the O

to O
the O

. O

Interesting O
as O
they O
advertise O
the O
Envy O
15 O
as O
silver O
/ O
black O
, O
yet O
this O
model O
' O
silver O
' O
so O
something O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
if O
an O
all O
silver O
laptop O
is O
important O
to O
you O
. O

Not O
enough O
yet O
to O
worry O
, O
but O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
see O
( O
spellcheck O

becoming O

) O
. O

I O
used O
this O
product O
over O
a O
year O
, O
but O
it O
alwayswas O
painful O
to O
use O
. O

- O
I O
paid O
$ O

plus O
sales O

from O

another O
thing O
i O
did O
not O
know O

it O
was O
not O
working O

A O
very O
good O

My O
hopes O
were O
to O
plug O
it O
in O
from O
my O
12V O
in O
the O
trunk O
and O
run O
the O
plug O
to O
the O
center O
counsel O
. O

this O
one O
works O
just O
like O
the O
original O
. O

Thought O
I O
would O
try O
them O
out O
. O

This O
was O
an O
experiment O
for O
me O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
share O
to O
possbily O
save O
others O
some O
time O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
an O
expert O
, O
but O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
, O
the O
monitor O
looks O
great O
, O
games O
look O
amazing O
, O
colors O
are O
accurate O
and O
saturation O
is O
on O
point O
. O

Though O
keep O
in O
mind O
if O
you O
put O
these O
things O
in O
this O
laptop O
the O
warranty O
is O
void O
because O
you O
have O
to O
remove O
and O
re O
- O
glue O
the O
MSata O
SSD O
mount O
to O
support O
the O
longer O
drive O
, O
and O
before O
you O
even O
begin O
to O
modify O
the O
thing O
you O
must O
update O
the O
bios O
so O
you O
can O
put O
your O
own O
windows O
on O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
Getting O
a O
new O
better O
laptop O
soon O
though O

thank O
goodness O

Though O
I O
've O
never O
been O
an O
HP O
fan O
, O
this O
laptop O
delights O
. O

Compared O
to O
MacBook O

Classic O
or O
even O
the O
MacBook O

, O
the O
keys O
on O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O

does O
n't O
push O

as O
low O
. O

The O
handle O
is O
actually O
very O
similar O
in O
construction O
to O
cases O
costing O
4x O
this O
. O

I O
got O
3 O
of O
these O
and O
all O
three O
are O
unstable O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
running O
faster O
now O
. O

The O
top O
fits O
on O
fine O
and O
is O
satisfactory O
. O

It O
's O
not O
often O
that O
an O
after O
- O
market O
product O
is O
better O
than O
the O
OEM O
part O
that O
it O
replaces O
, O
but O
this O
one O
is O
. O

Some O
heavier O
lenses O
did O
n't O
feel O
as O
secure O
and O
I O
kept O
my O
hand O
on O
them O
at O
all O
times O
. O

Rubberized O
case O
fits O
great O
and O
looks O
great O
. O

You O
can O
also O
put O
a O
light O
jacket O
in O
the O
bungee O
cord O
area O
or O
a O
bottle O
of O
water O
. O

I O
am O
using O
this O
as O
a O
second O
monitor O
. O

The O
front O
pocket O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
keep O
a O
pad O
of O
paper O
or O
similar O
items O
easily O
accessible O
. O

In O
a O
nut O
- O
shell O
, O
it O
doubles O
my O
wifi O
speed O
. O

Just O
a O
note O
: O
I O
originally O
bought O
the O
2 O
gig O
version O
but O
returned O
it O
to O
upgrade O
to O
this O
one O
. O

The O
keyboard O
came O
quickly O
and O
arrived O
unbroken O
and O
well O
packaged O
. O

I O
can O
deal O
with O
the O
weight O
because O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
lighter O
than O
my O
text O
books O
. O

Skype O
call O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
every O
night O
. O

I O
am O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
Tenergy O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
may O
consider O
the O
Linksys O
w O
/ O
speedboast O
. O

and O
it O
is O
a O
good O
product O
. O

OK O
, O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
real O
test O
of O
the O
product O
, O
( O
repair O
services O
) O
. O

That O
same O
intel O
connection O
utility O
installed O
fine O
on O
a O
second O
PC O
from O
a O
different O
manufacturer O
, O
also O
running O
Windows O
8 O
. O

I O
also O
find O
streaming O
radio O
stations O
sound O
excellent O
too O
. O

While O
the O
idea O
a O
detachable O
keyboard O
on O
a O
tablet O
is O
great O
, O
the O
additional O
battery O
life O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

Tried O
it O
with O
the O
USB O
power O
cord O
- O
nothing O
, O
no O
status O
light O
, O
no O
sound O
, O
nothing O
! O

It O
works O
as O
advertised O
. O

More O
annoyingly O
, O
it O
is O
harder O
to O
double O
- O
click O
without O
readjusting O
your O
hand O
, O
because O
your O
fingertips O
reach O
all O
the O
way O
over O
the O
mouse O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
-- O
have O
an O
odd O
' O
test O
' O
page O
that O
prints O
sometimes O
, O
but O
that O
could O
always O
be O
due O
to O
something O
else O
and O
not O
the O
cable O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
EVERY O
SINGLE O
form O
factor O
iteration O
of O
the O
Macbook O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
the O
Pro O

, O
even O
back O
to O
the O

Powerbook O

when O
i O
bought O
this O
thing O
honestly O
i O
did O
nt O
expect O
much O
... O
but O

Once O
on O
, O
the O
tablet O
start O
displaying O
some O
very O
nice O
looking O
LED O
light O

, O
the O
price O
is O
right O
, O
and O
I O
've O
never O
had O
to O
call O
some O
English O
- O
as O

and O
is O
about O
the O
same O
as O
my O
GF O
's O
Ipad2 O
. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
hassle O
for O
larger O
notebooksThe O
computer O
compartment O
is O
well O
padded O

will O
protect O

, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
change O
or O
modify O
something O
yourself O
, O
Linux O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
neck O
. O

The O
DVD O
picture O
quality O
is O
wonderful O
too O
. O

so O
if O
you O
have O
a O
need O
to O
throw O
video O
into O
mpeg4 O
this O
will O
do O
the O
job O
. O

It O
would O
probably O
be O
awesome O
as O
a O
single O
- O
purpose O
bag O
for O
a O
cameraperson O
who O
does O
n't O
fly O
and O
carries O
many O
lenses O
and O
a O
laptop O
. O

The O
original O
broke O
and O
I O
needed O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
a O
new O
one O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
WINDOWS O
7 O
and O
it O
was O
a O
smooth O
transition O
. O

The O
light O
is O
not O
bright O
at O
all O
( O
which O
I O
prefer O
) O
. O

but O
I O
still O
had O
a O
to O
strain O
to O
hear O
. O

The O
file O
was O
copied O
from O
an O
internally O
mounted O
Seagate O

. O
5 O
TB O
drive O
to O
the O
dock O
mounted O
1 O
. O
5 O
TB O
drive O
and O
then O
back O
. O

I O
am O
not O
using O
this O
webcam O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
that O
most O
people O
probably O
do O
. O

So O
the O
Tab O
2 O
went O
back O
. O

It O
feels O
quite O
secure O
. O

This O
SD O
card O
is O
a O
nice O
idea O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
write O
fast O
enough O
to O
take O
rapid O
sequence O
photos O
on O
a O
Canon O
T4i O
, O
so O
the O
functionality O
of O
this O
in O
the O
camera O
is O
limited O
to O
one O
shot O
at O
a O
time O
. O

( O
You O
have O
wireless O
Ethernet O
, O
of O
course).Of O

I O
love O
the O
size O
of O
the O
screen O
and O
the O
large O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
was O
up O
with O
the O
1st O
reviewer O
, O
but O
these O
are O
Headset O
Buddy O
brand O
, O
and O
work O
excellent O
! O

but O
both O
of O
them O
were O
small O
and O
did O
n't O
produce O
the O
amount O
of O
light O
I O
wanted O
. O

Upon O
ingesting O
client O
photos O
for O
manipulation O
... O
the O
Sony O
VAIO O
started O
hiccuping O
... O
after O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
pics O
ingested O
... O

I O
am O
using O
this O
with O
a O
Mac O
, O
and O
it O
works O
well O
. O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
device O
, O
like O
a O
phone O
, O
that O
wo O
n't O
fast O
charge O
unless O
it O
sees O
the O
data O
pins O
are O
shorted O
? O

Really O
does O
the O
trick O
. O

so O
I O
thought O
these O
headphones O
had O
to O
be O
good O
. O

Updated O
an O
older O
laptop O
. O

Honestly O
, O
if O
anyone O
writes O
that O
bass O
quality O
is O
an O
individual O
taste O
, O
and O
writes O
that O
this O
TV O
has O
" O
just O
fine O
" O
bass O
, O
DO O
NOT O
BELIEVE O
THEM O
. O

org O
installed O
along O
with O
some O
classic O
production O
tools O
for O
my O
other O
needs O

This O
is O
an O
obviously O
high O
quality O
cable O
. O

So O
I O
have O
decided O
not O
to O
buy O
any O
SanDisk O
products O
ever O
again O
. O

It O
has O
a O
nice O
loudness O
and O
depth O
for O
its O
size O
, O
with O
good O
treble O
/ O
bass O
balance O
and O
volume O
control O
. O

The O
wheel O
stuck O
and O
now O
I O
can O
not O
scroll O
. O

If O
I O
have O
to O
switch O
batteries O
in O
a O
hurry O
or O
switch O
to O
the O
extended O
, O
it O
can O
be O
irritating O
. O

The O
two O
card O
readers O
are O
a O
convenience O
even O
with O
the O
160 O
GB O
hard O
drive O
. O

This O
was O
relatively O
painless O
process O

and O
the O
price O
was O
right O
for O
this O
product O
. O

Not O
a O
deal O
- O
breaker O
for O
me O
, O
I O
could O
always O
listen O
through O
a O
stereo O
if O
I O
want O
to O
. O

I O
had O
a O
42 O
" O
Panasonice O
Viera O
Plasma O
in O
my O
bedroom O
on O
a O
free O
standing O
stand O
. O

I O
've O
noticed O
that O
many O
electronics O
charging O
unit O
most O
time O
generate O
heat O
( O
like O
the O
iPad O
, O
iPhone).Unit O
is O
used O
every O
single O
day O
so O
far O
( O
daughter O
is O
youtube O
addict O
) O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
purchasing O
HP O
products O
again O
. O

" O
Thank O
you O
for O
remaining O
on O
hold O
. O

i O
wanted O
a O
cheap O
and O
simple O
computer O
and O
this O
did O
it O
, O
i O
named O
mine O
pablo O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
jealous O

It O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
Samsung O
made O
it O
easy O
to O
upgrade O
to O
the O
latest O
Android O
OS O
... O

and O
it O
'll O
connect O
to O
your O
device O
as O
long O
as O
you O
have O
the O
device O
's O
bluetooth O
on O
. O

Does O
n't O
have O
the O
same O
" O
click O
" O
as O
the O
original O
keyboard O
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
have O
noticed O
if O
my O
son O
had O
n't O
mentioned O
it O
. O

3.- O
A O
bright O
, O
clear O
screen O
with O
HD O
resolution O
for O
a O
very O
nice O
movie O
viewing O
experience.- O
Seperate O
numberpad O
area O
is O
rarely O
found O
on O
laptops O
of O
this O
size.- O
Adequate O
hard O
drive O
space O
. O

Would O
be O
weaker O
/ O
slower O
if O
the O
computer O
was O
further O
away O
; O
as O
that O
's O
a O
given O
. O

For O
those O
who O
are O
curious O
about O
whether O
it O
works O
with O
Linux O
based O
operating O
systems O
such O
as O
( O
K O
) O
Ubuntu O
or O
not O
, O
here O
are O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
get O
it O
going O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
while O
the O
bag O
goes O
through O
the O
xray O
machine O
, O
stuff O
can O
slip O
under O
the O
laptop O
compartment O
( O
which O
unfortunately O
is O
n't O
totally O
sealed O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
bag O
) O
, O
and O
then O
it O
can O
be O
a O
challenge O
to O
get O
the O
laptop O
back O
in O
and O
properly O
seated O
. O

This O
case O
however O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
slim O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
a O
messenger O
bag O
. O

Shipping O
was O
super O
fast O
. O

so O
that O
's O
a O
major O
plus O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
add O
much O
height O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

They O
do O
have O
a O
90 O
watt O
adapter O
which O
is O
what O
I O
would O
suggest O
getting O
. O

After O
removing O
a O
couple O
screws O
, O
I O
used O
an O
old O
credit O
card O
to O
very O
carefully O
remove O
the O
keyboard O
( O
start O
on O
the O
right O
edge O
, O
and O
gently O
work O
the O
credit O
card O
all O
the O
way O
around O
) O
. O

so O
you O
need O
to O
buy O
some O
conversion O
software O
- O
which O
one O
you O
get O
. O

She O
ended O
up O
mounting O
it O
on O
her O
frame O
which O
was O
inconvenient O
, O
especially O
since O
it O
had O
to O
be O
plugged O
into O
her O
phone O
. O

I O
then O
plugged O
in O
each O
charger O
and O
recorded O
the O
charge O
time O
each O
took O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
instructions O
it O
states O
to O
unplug O
the O
unit O
when O
not O
in O
use O
, O
so O
I O
take O
that O
as O
it O
should O
not O
to O
be O
used O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
. O

The O
pictures O
are O
crisp O
and O
vibrant O
, O
the O
sound O
excellent O
. O

I O
thought O
maybe O
if O
I O
got O
a O
small O
backpack O
I O
would O
n't O
carry O
so O
much O
stuff O
- O
wrong O
. O

Granted O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
Windows O
user O
, O
but O
this O
was O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
on O
my O
iMac O
. O

Prior O
to O
that O
I O
use O
to O
use O
one O
of O
Energizer O
's O
$ O
30 O
chargers O
, O
but O
switched O
because O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
charger O
was O
the O
only O
problem O
. O

The O
650 O
series O
is O
the O
sweet O
spot O
of O
Samsung O
TV O
's O
because O
it O
has O
the O
same O
great O
picture O
quality O
of O
the O
higher O
models O
but O
with O
a O
lower O
price O
but O
blows O
away O
the O
lower O
models O
in O
picture O
quality O
. O

Bottom O
line O
ITEM O
IS O
NOT O
AS O
ADVERTISED O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
-- O
I O
also O
own O
a O
powerful O
desktop O
I O
do O
most O
of O
my O
' O
heavy O
' O
computing O
on O
. O

Not O
a O
big O
deal O
for O
the O
price O
if O
you O
ask O
me O
. O

I O
love O
this O
thing O
and O
have O
preaching O
to O
my O
friends O
to O
get O
one O
.. O

Just O
installed O
the O
driver O
from O
the O
CD O
and O
plug O
it O
in O
. O

I O
also O
have O
an O
iPad O
, O
but O
consider O
it O
a O
& O
# O
34;consumption&#34 O
; O
device O
for O
carrying O
around O
the O
house O
and O
reading O
on O
the O
john O
like O
a O
magazine O
. O

Better O
audio O
system O
, O
5 O
USB O
vs O
4 O
USB O
, O

Also O
, O
while O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
MBP O
is O
not O
upgradeable O
bothers O
me O
slightly O
, O
my O
actual O
experience O
with O
both O
work O
and O
home O
PCs O
is O
that O
I O
've O
replaced O
them O
every O
2 O
- O
5 O
years O
anyway O
. O

Micro O
fiber O
cloth O
not O
really O
needed O
. O

key O
board O
and O
internal O
speakers O
are O
an O
issue O
. O

The O
only O
negatives O
are O
minor O
: O
I O
wish O
the O
screen O
was O
matte O
like O
the O
CR48 O
, O
instead O
of O
glossy O
. O

The O
straps O
dig O
into O
her O
shoulder O
when O
it O
is O
weighted O
down O
. O

Last O
... O
put O
your O
iPad O
away O
and O
forget O
you O
own O
it O
for O
a O
day O
( O
or O
, O
if O
you O
can O
wait O
, O
two O
days O
) O
. O

Bought O
it O
for O
Dell O
E1505 O
Laptop O
and O
using O
dell O
original O
battery O
charger O
. O

The O
Good O
- O
Display O
1920x1080 O
is O
lovely O
. O

Lightweight O
and O
compact O
, O
the O
Z205 O
can O
be O
conveniently O
packed O
for O
travel O
. O

It O
glides O
like O
it O
is O
on O
an O
air O
cushion O
over O
any O
surface O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
my O
new O
battery O
for O
about O
a O
month O
and O
my O
laptop O
can O
remain O
on O
for O
3 O
- O
4 O
hours O
without O
needing O
to O
be O
charged O
; O
it O
's O
great O
! O

I O
really O
dislike O
leaving O
low O
ratings O
on O
inexpensive O
equipment O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
be O
honest O
on O
this O
keyboard O
. O

and O
I O
thought O
that O
Lowepro O
was O
a O
bit O
overkill O
and O
overpriced O
. O

This O
particular O
Spec O
production O
is O
great O
. O

I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
and O
will O
likely O
log O
on O
again O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
/ O
months O
and O
provide O
a O
follow O
- O
up O
review O
. O

This O
took O
me O
maybe O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

Good O
quality O
for O
the O
money O
. O

it O
is O
sturdy O
and O
well O
constructed O
. O

Which O
is O
n't O
very O
comfortable O
over O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
. O

If O
you O
are O
okay O
with O
small O
bubbles O
mostly O
caused O
by O
miniscule O
trapped O
dust O
particles O
, O
this O
anti O
- O
glare O
screen O
works O
pretty O
well O
. O

This O
one O
does O
the O
job O
very O
well O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
use O
the O
microphone O
from O
your O
smartphone O
headset O
. O

What O
would O
have O
made O
it O
worthwhile O
would O
have O
been O
the O
inclusion O
of O
a O
car O
adapter O
instead O
of O
the O
PS O
- O
finding O
a O
12VDC O
adapter O
for O
my O
car O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
more O
difficult O
than O
I O
expected O
, O
though O
I O
did O
succeed O
( O
on O
Amazon O
of O
course O
) O
. O

I O
have O
made O
several O
purchases O
from O
this O
vendor O
with O
excellent O
experiences O
. O

but O
so O
is O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
mouse O

Bought O
this O
product O
as O
it O
was O
going O
at O
a O
very O
competitive O
price O
. O

had O
a O
couple O
of O
dropouts O
( O
very O
brief O
) O
, O
but O
none O
last O
few O
days O
. O

Next O
is O
the O
main O
storage O
compaartment O
which O
has O
a O
full O
wrap O
around O
zipper O
. O

I O
tried O
updating O
the O
firmware O
and O
even O
flashing O
it O
to O
Tomato O
. O

Holy O
heck O

July O
23rd O
, O
and O
here O
I O
am O
watching O
my O
favorite O
weekend O
shows O
in O
hi O
- O
def O
! O

The O
standard O
1 O
GB O
memory O
included O
appears O
to O
work O
fine O
. O

It O
was O
also O
balanced O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
so O
when O
I O
set O
it O
down O
, O
it O
did O
not O
topple O
forward O
or O
backwards O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
for O
anyone O
needing O
to O
replace O
their O
laptop O
charger O
, O
or O
those O
just O
needing O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
spare O
. O

However O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
several O
preconfigured O
settings O
; O
graphics O
setting O
brightened O
up O
the O
screen O
considerably O
over O
the O
mode O
for O
text O
reading O
. O

The O
Receiver O
shows O
your O
position O
in O
real O
time O
on O
street O
- O
level O
maps O
and O
moves O
with O
you O
as O
you O
travel O
, O
so O
you O
can O
view O
your O
current O
location O
in O
relation O
to O
your O
destination O

I O
bought O
this O
card O
reader O
in O
Feb. O
2004 O
to O
use O
with O
SD O
cards O
. O

Very O
solid O
build O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
Belkin O
wireless O

stick O
I O
had O

Why O
pay O
$ O
20 O
- O
30 O
for O
one O
of O
these O
- O
this O
one O
works O
just O
fine O
, O
and O
the O
price O
is O
terrific O
! O

Not O
a O
ding O
against O
the O
case O
though O
. O

If O
that O
had O
been O
the O
cost O
, O
would O
have O
bought O
6 O
or O
more O
. O

When O
not O
on O
the O
road O
, O
I O
remove O
the O
battery O
and O
run O
on O
AC O
power O
, O
in O
order O
to O
prolong O
the O
battery O
's O
lifespan O
( O
heat O
deteriorates O
the O
cells O
) O
. O

The O
Thunderbolt O
port O
is O
a O
revolution O
, O
as O
it O
works O
for O
displays O
, O
drives O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
have O
to O
characterize O
myself O
as O
a O
nit O
- O
picker O
when O
I O
shop O
for O
canvas O
bags O
and O
cases O
for O
my O
electronic O
do O
- O
dads O
. O

I O
've O
used O
a O
ton O
of O
Cisco O
- O
Linksys O
products O
over O
the O
years O
and O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O
with O
them O
until O
now O
. O

They O
are O
hard O
plastic O
and O
very O
noisy O
. O

I O
'll O
speak O
personally O
from O
how O
this O
has O
helped O
me O
in O
my O
specific O
situation O
, O
in O
case O
there O
is O
someone O
who O
may O
be O
in O
a O
similar O
situation O
. O

No O
software O
conflicts O
-- O
pure O
plug O
and O
play O
. O

I O
think O
hdd O
failure O
is O
an O
" O
expected O
" O
event O
: O
can O
happen O
at O
any O
time O
to O
any O
hdd O
... O

the O
back O
is O
padded O
and O
sectioned O
, O
and O
the O
straps O
are O
nice O
and O
chubby O
. O

The O
integral O
graphics O
card O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
pretty O
good O

I O
've O
had O
them O
plugged O
in O
for O
over O
a O
month O
and O
they O
are O
still O
good O
as O
new O
. O

I O
stream O
pandora O
from O
my O
phone O
to O
the O

on O
the O
factory O
radio O
. O

Seems O
most O
of O
my O
gear O
failures O
are O
b O
/ O
c O
of O
overpacking O
and O

Very O
nice O
to O
be O
off O
the O
WiFi O
when O
I O
'm O
parked O
at O
my O
desk O
at O
work O
. O

Did O
a O
great O
job O
at O
what O
I O
needed O
it O
for O
and O
stil O
use O
it O
to O
power O
my O
notebook O
. O

There O
was O
no O
abuse O
of O
the O
broken O
one O
, O
nor O
of O
my O
device O
. O

The O
gel O
that O
they O
use O
for O
the O
cover O
is O
MUCH O
thinner O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
so O
awkward O
at O
first O

overall O
its O
a O
phenomenal O

! O

It O
is O
a O
great O
size O

for O

Although O
none O
of O
the O
numbers O
on O
the O
battery O
itself O
matched O
those O
for O
my O
notebook O
, O
it O
fit O
just O
like O
the O
original O
battery O
, O
arrived O
nearly O
fully O
charged O
, O
and O
works O
great O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
'm O
pretty O
frustrated O
. O

My O
dock O
is O
one O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
returned O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

What O
stands O
out O
the O
most O
to O
me O
is O
the O
midrange O
, O
then O
the O
highs O
( O
treble O
) O
then O
the O
lows O
( O
base O
) O
in O
that O
order O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
're O
running O
through O
the O
rain O
, O
your O
papers O
and O
electronics O
are O
exposed O
to O
the O
weather O
. O

Other O
Netbook O
keyboards O
I O
liked O

Well O
worth O
the O
premium O
price O
tag O
. O

The O
arrangement O
of O
the O
keys O
on O
the O
remote O
control O
differ O
from O
all O
the O
other O
remotes O
I O
own O
; O
nothing O
new O
here O
. O

Hopefully O
the O
first O
one O
was O
a O
fluke O
as O
I O
intend O
to O
do O
more O
business O
with O
this O
company O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
the O
best O
way O
, O
because O
then O
you O
can O
have O
many O
, O
MANY O
pictures O
inside O
of O
one O
file O
and O
wah O
- O
lah O
, O
it O
works O
. O

Besides O
, O
if O
it O
had O
any O
more O
padding O
, O
you O
would O
have O
to O
sacrifice O
usable O
volume O
. O

it O
's O
not O
genuine O
Lenovo O
all O
the O
time O
, O
which O
is O
a O
bit O
annoying O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
Samsung O
Series O
3 O
Chromebook O
and O
it O
fits O
it O
perfectly O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
care O
about O
style O
and O
just O
want O
a O
simple O
and O
useful O
sleeve O
for O
your O
13inch O
labtop O
than O
this O
will O
do O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
the O
local O
coffee O
shop O
and O
do O
not O
need O
an O
external O
mouse O
or O
power O
cord O
, O
then O
this O
could O
serve O
as O
a O
carrying O
case O
. O

Wellll O
, O
maybe O
the O
lack O
of O
blueray O
if O
that O
's O
your O
thing O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
the O

is O

. O

Specially O
for O
my O
old O
mom O
and O
dad O
who O
are O
not O
well O
versed O
with O
computers O
. O

I O
know O
this O
is O
for O
a O
phone O
, O
but O
it O
works O
excellent O
with O
the O
Tritton O
AX O
Pro O
Gaming O
Headset O
. O

A O
technician O
came O
out O
but O
said O
the O
problem O
was O
unfixable O
, O
so O
it O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

This O
USB O
light O
serves O
its O
purpose O
. O

For O
the O
typical O
home O
or O
office O
user O
, O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
space O

green O

Charging O
the O

while O
it O

off O

and O
hoping O
for O

is O
what O
I O
would O
like O

This O
new O
laptop O
that O
I O
now O
call O
my O
" O
Gaming O
Laptop O
" O
passes O
the O
test O
. O

The O
' O
normal O
' O
desktop O
still O
uses O
touch O
and O
swipe O
but O
naturally O
the O
older O
applications O
do O
n't O
recognize O
it O
. O

Make O
sure O
all O
drivers O
are O
up O
to O
date O
. O

It O
is O
physically O
comfortable O
to O
use O
with O
very O
little O
fatigue O
over O
longer O
gaming O
sessions O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
experienced O
any O
lag O
issues O
at O
all O
, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
n't O
tried O
to O
activate O
more O
than O
about O
7 O
tabs O
at O
a O
time O
, O
so O
far O
. O

It O
is O
padded O
with O
a O
rubberized O
back O
surface O
- O
but O
not O
" O
pre O
- O
curved O
" O
in O
any O
direction O
. O

Windows O

works O
very O
well O
. O

I O
probably O
would O
have O
kept O
it O
, O
if O
I O
could O
have O
used O
it O
though O
. O

I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
transaction O
. O

In O
the O
end O
the O
battery O
worked O
fine O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
, O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
when O
thinking O
of O
what O
battery O
you O
want O
to O
order O
. O

The O
driver O
included O
with O
the O
Ubuntu O
distro O
ultimately O
did O
work O
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

Noticed O
one O
of O
the O
prongs O
was O
bent O
. O

Very O
comfortable O
on O
shoulder O
. O

This O
model O
was O
sold O
out O
and O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
get O
a O
white O
one O
instead O
. O

i O
like O
it O
but O
the O
problem O
is O
i O
have O
an O
iphone O

really O
tough O
to O
handle O
, O
lots O
of O
bubbles O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
annoying O

If O
you O
can O
wait O
this O
might O
be O
the O
way O
to O
go.- O
I O
worry O
about O
the O
long O
term O
stability O
of O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
sturdy O
enough O
to O
protect O
my O
17 O
inch O
laptop O
when O
I O
take O
it O
on O
the O
road O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
looking O
on O
Ebay O
hoping O
to O
score O
an O
old O
style O
bag O
for O
a O
backup O
to O
mine O
, O
which O
is O
still O
holding O
up O
pretty O
darn O
well O
. O

I O
tended O
to O
think O
all O
these O
small O
widgets O
coming O
out O
of O
china O
should O
be O
the O
same O
, O
but O
bluetooth O
adaptors O
have O
demonstrated O
otherwise O
. O

Same O
goes O
for O
wallets O
and O
the O
like O
--- O
it O
's O
annoying O
to O
to O
unzip O
the O
front O
compartment O
to O
get O
at O
the O
pockets O
. O

1A O
like O
the O
iPad O
and O
many O
Androids O
) O
but O
perfect O
for O

If O
you O
want O
to O
put O
these O
in O
a O
bedroom O
, O
plan O
on O
having O
your O
entire O
room O
glow O
blue O
, O
or O
put O
the O
sub O
woofer O
in O
a O
convenient O
position O
. O

So O
we O
both O
deal O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
wifi O
card O
in O
this O
computer O
is O
rather O
cheap O
and O
troublesome O
. O

it O
wo O
n't O
protect O
your O
Mac O
from O
a O
big O
fall O
. O

Testing O
out O
this O
little O
webcam O
was O
interesting O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
actually O
like O
the O
keyboard O
, O
even O
though O
I O
did O
not O
get O
a O
netbook O
with O
the O
intention O
to O
use O
it O
for O
much O
typing O
. O

I O
expected O
a O
little O
more O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
13 O
" O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Received O
car O
and O

Upgrading O
to O
1 O
TB O
and O
the O
Hybrid O
drive O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

I O
am O
tempted O
to O
get O
another O
one O
, O
so O
I O
can O
change O
it O
up O
from O
time O
to O
time O
! O

/l O
the O
amazon O
appstore O
for O
some O
freebies O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
folks O
are O
going O
to O
remote O
keyboards O
and O
we O
did O
also O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
does O
n't O
replace O
larger O
more O
expensive O
speakers O
, O
but O
for O
basic O
everyday O
use O
, O
they O
are O
quite O
practical O
. O

I O
'll O
update O
if O
anything O
were O
to O
happen O
with O
it O
, O
but O
so O
far O
so O
good O
- O
5 O
star O
. O

It O
's O
big O
enough O
that O
you O
feel O
confortable O
with O
it O
. O

The O
Bluetooth O
dongle O
shipped O
fast O
and O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
I O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
older O
version O
but O
since O
Bluetooth O
is O
short O
range O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
an O
issue O
. O

After O
reading O
all O
the O
good O
things O
about O
the O
Netbook O
, O
I O
had O
to O
get O
it O
. O

Then O
it O
started O
to O
download O
an O
update O
, O
but O
only O
got O
up O
to O
about O
20 O
% O
and O
crashed O
, O
leaving O
the O
router O
completely O
useless O
; O
it O
would O
not O
connect O
to O
anything O
, O
even O
the O
Web O
. O

Also O
the O
quality O
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
. O

Case O
Logic O
's O
website O
assured O
me O
that O
this O
16 O
" O
attache O
would O
be O
big O
enough O
for O
my O
Sony O
Vaio O
VGN O
- O
FW O
with O
a O
16 O
. O
4 O
" O
screen O
. O

Delivery O
was O
in O
4 O
days O
- O
right O
into O
my O
family O
room O
. O

This O
makes O
it O
compatible O
with O
just O
about O
anything O
with O
Bluetooth O
capabilities O
- O
phone O
, O
tablet O
, O
netbook O
and O
even O
a O
Bluetooth O
equipped O
PC O
. O

However O
, O
unfortunately O
it O
falls O
quite O
short O
where O
it O
counts O
, O
namely O
day O
to O
day O
usage O
. O

I O
've O
used O
it O
for O
over O
6 O
months O
now O
, O
and O
can O
say O
that O
i O
am O
not O
very O
impressed O
. O

It O
's O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
's O
adjustable O
, O
but O
it O
does O
exist.-I O
got O
the O
impression O
from O
the O
description O
that O
this O
came O
with O
an O
mp3 O
player O
cradle O
. O

Perfect O
size O
case O
for O
my O
Ipad O
since O
I O
got O
a O
Bluetooth O
Wireless O
Keyboard O
360 O
Degrees O
Rotate O
Sliding O
Cover O
Case O
. O

It O
is O
the O
thinnest O
case O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
for O
a O
Macbook O
air O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
was O
n't O
quite O
as O
svelte O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
description O
of O
" O
ultra O
- O
thin".Having O
no O
zipper O
is O
great O
. O

So O
use O
YCbCr444 O
mode O
. O

I O
still O
use O
the O
REI O
laptop O
sleeve O
instead O
of O
the O
rigid O
sleeve O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
bag O
, O
mainly O
because O
I O
like O
it O
better O
and O
it O
fits O
in O
the O
bag O
perfectly O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
found O
it O
to O
be O
a O
nice O
netbook O
that O
gives O
you O
more O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O
. O

The O
Aspire O
was O
actually O
the O
first O
notebook O
I O
looked O
at O
. O

I O
have O
one O
of O
these O
and O
when O
I O
go O
on O
flights O
I O
can O
share O
my O
tablet O
with O
a O
friend O
, O
or O
the O
fat O
guy O
that O
is O
taking O
up O
half O
my O
seat O
. O

Only O
the O
face O
is O
plastic O
, O
so O
it O
will O
stay O
where O
you O
put O
it O
. O

I O
could O
find O
south O
of O
the O
$ O
500 O
price O
point O
. O

This O
is O
larger O
than O
the O
mini O
optical O
mouse O
shown O
in O
the O
website O
. O

My O
favorite O
mode O
is O
display O
mode O
when O
use O
it O
in O
bed O
. O

so O
I O
put O
my O
NOD32 O
on O
it O
which O
is O
way O
better O
. O

In O
each O
case O
the O
cord O
came O
unplugged O
from O
the O
computer O
( O
as O
it O
is O
designed O
to O
do O
) O
without O
pulling O
the O
machine O
down O
with O
it O
. O

No O
heat O
problems O
or O
other O
issues O
. O

It O
should O
be O
advertised O
correctly O
as O
man O
- O
made O
leather O
or O
synthetic O
leather O
. O

I O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
is O
water O
- O
proof O
, O
however O
, O
I O
have O
run O
from O
the O
car O
in O
the O
rain O
with O
it O
, O
and O
it O
did O
not O
soak O
through O
. O

but O
it O
will O
do O
fine O
for O
protecting O
the O
netbook O
from O
bumps O
and O
handling O
. O

I O
had O
to O
keep O
reviewing O
how O
my O
keys O
are O
mapped O
and O
where O
my O
fingers O
are O
. O

ConclusionThis O
is O
a O
great O
work O
Ultrabook O
with O
a O
comfort O
of O
touchscreen O
when O
you O
want O
& O
a O
comfort O

needed O

Mode O

Good O
looks O
and O
works O
well O
. O

it O
seems O
these O
memory O
cards O
either O
work O
slow O
or O
something O
is O
wrong O
with O
them O
. O

Yes O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
pack O
. O

With O
the O
laptop O
sitting O
on O
the O
cooler O
, O
the O
center O
part O
of O
the O
bottom O
would O
get O
pushed O
up O
when O
set O
on O
the O
mattress O
, O
which O
then O
touches O
the O
spinning O
fan O
creating O
unberable O
noise O
... O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
haters O
on O
this O
thing O
and O
it O
is O
not O
exactly O
bombproof O
or O
terribly O
well O
- O
made O
, O
but O
I O
have O
serious O
wrist O
and O
shoulder O
problems O
and O
I O
use O
my O
big O
TV O
screen O
as O
my O
monitor O
and O
the O
mouse O
is O
like O
a O
remote O
control O
for O
me O
and O
this O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

I O
love O
this O
thing O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
overlapping O
nature O
of O
Wifi O
channels O
, O
you O
should O
never O
use O
any O
channel O
other O
than O
1 O
, O
6 O
, O
or O
11 O
anyway O
. O

Here O
are O
some O
my O
observations O
after O
owning O
it O
for O
about O
a O
month:- O

I O
wanted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
reach O
my O
banks O
and O
brokers O
and O
e O
- O
mail O
while O
abroad O
. O

It O
can O
double O
boot O
Ubuntu O
from O
[ O
... O
] O
, O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
put O
in O
some O
time O
and O
get O
the O
sound O
to O
work O
( O
I O
did O
) O
. O

Well O
it O
was O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
and O

HDMI O
transmitter O
is O
powered O
through O
a O
mini O
usb O
port O
, O
which O
I O
was O
able O
to O
power O
using O
a O
general O
USB O
wall O
brick O
from O
an O
old O
cell O
phone O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
good O
cooling O
fan O
for O
a O
laptop O
! O

Simple O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
its O
there O
. O

I O
am O
using O
Windows O
7 O
64-bit O
and O
it O
really O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
simpler O
to O
install O
and O
use O
. O

I O
appreciate O
Win O
7 O
being O
on O
it O
, O
and O
a O
full O
fledged O
version O
of O
it O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
Google O
app O
called O
" O
X O
New O
Tab O
Page O
" O
to O
customize O
my O
home O
screen O
, O
making O
all O
my O
favorite O
apps O
, O
extensions O
, O
web O
pages O
etc O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
re O
- O
arrange O
( O
you O
can O
even O
upload O
your O
own O
images O
to O
the O
icon O
buttons O
) O
-- O

NOTE O

In O
summary O
, O
the O
E5 O
can O
make O
your O
headphones O
sound O
a O
bit O
more O
attractive O
, O
if O
you O
have O
the O
right O
" O
taste O
" O
and O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
set O
of O
compatible O
headphones O

so O
on O
, O
the O
battery O
lasts O
almos O
5 O
hours O
and O
the O
cooling O
system O
is O
decent O
but O
no O
so O
efficient O
when O
you O
are O
unplugged O
from O
the O
electricity O

The O
price O
was O
great O
, O
and O
I O
received O
the O
product O
without O
delay O
and O
boy O
was O
it O
beautiful O

On O
this O

from O

to O
receive O
an O
evaluation O
unit O
of O
their O
mini O
speaker O
for O

purposes O
I O
was O
eager O
to O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
other O
speakers O
I O
recently O
evaluated O
. O

No O
issues O
with O
the O
monitor O
as O
a O
result O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
watch O
Netflix O
( O
not O
yet O
on O
" O
This O
" O

, O
but O
videos O
are O
terrible O
anyway O
on O
this O
) O
, O
HBO2GO O
and O
Amazon O

on O
my O

so O
there O
's O
less O
chance O
of O
it O
being O
knocked O
overFor O
Dish O
Network O
users O
- O
easy O
to O
use O
with O
the O
on O

I O
'll O
be O
happy O
if O
this O
power O
lasts O
that O
long O
, O
but O
looking O
at O
other O
reviews O
, O
I O
may O
not O
get O
more O
than O
a O
year O
out O
of O
it O
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
work O
just O
fine O
at O
first O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
not O
spend O
a O
pretty O
penny O
on O
a O
nice O
leather O
case O
then O
I O
would O
go O
for O
this O
case O
. O

Now O
it O
shows O
a O
full O
charge O
, O
but O
when O
the O
laptop O
is O
operated O
on O
battery O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
the O
whole O
machine O
shuts O
down O
without O
warning O
and O
will O
not O
come O
back O
on O
until O
plugged O
in O
to O
the O
adapter O
. O

Forgot O
where O
it O
was O
sorry O
. O

this O
laptop O
fitted O
here O
plenty O
of O
room O
and O
cushioned O
by O
the O
padding O
inserts O
. O

I O
responded O
that O
I O
chose O
to O
utilize O
the O
90-day O
service O
and O
if O
all O
goes O
well O
, O
this O
could O
be O
a O
consideration O
. O

First O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
" O
Wow O
, O
watching O
a O
3D O
movie O
on O
my O
2D O
TV O
would O
be O
great O
. O

I O
bought O
alot O
of O
these O

The O
13 O
" O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
real O
estate O
once O
you O
learn O
all O
the O
useful O
swiping O
, O
re O
- O
sizing O
and O
change O
- O
focus O
gestures O
. O

Plugged O
in O
to O
the O
laptop O
with O
ease O
. O

I O
found O
the O
ipad O
would O
dislodge O
with O
very O
little O
pressure O
. O

plus O
no O
cables O
involved O
only O
bluetooth O
which O
is O
an O
advantage O

The O
sound O
from O
my O
neighbors O
setup O
was O
full O
, O
rich O
, O
tight O
smack O
you O
in O
the O
chest O
base O
. O

It O
fits O
two O
17 O
inch O
laptops O
and O
two O
Shon O
Harris O
CISSP O
books O
in O
it O
and O
room O
for O
power O
adapter O
and O
a O
few O
ties O
above O
the O
books O
. O

It O
's O
cheap O
enough O
to O
simply O
purchase O
a O
new O
one O
when O
it O
wears O
out O
. O

There O
are O
two O
different O
models O
. O

All O
that O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
a O
side O
- O
effect O
of O
a O
splitter O
being O
that O
the O
two O
output O
sources O
would O
have O
a O
buzzing O
sound O
. O

The O
stand O
however O
does O
n't O
play O
well O
with O
cases O
. O

But O
know O
that O
I O
LOVE O
this O
HDTV O
. O

You O
really O
have O
to O
press O
and O
make O
a O
conscience O
effort O
to O
get O
what O
you O
type O
. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
this O
keyboard O
. O

Since O
I O
wrote O
this O
review O
the O
whole O
connector O
bit O
has O
come O
apart O
, O
I O
have O
barely O
used O
it O

Great O
picture O
, O
nearly O
perfect O
... O

So O
the O
case O
must O
be O
doing O
something O
right O
! O

ITEM O
WORKS O
GREAT!!!!Works O
perfectly O
with O
my O

It O
provides O
adequate O
protection O
for O
the O
laptop O
from O
companion O
items O
in O
a O
backpack O
or O
messenger O
bag O
. O

For O
backup O
, O
I O
am O
just O
copying O
the O
folders O
I O
care O
about O
most O
to O
this O
portable O
safe O
, O
as O
a O
quick O
way O
to O
save O
work O
performed O
between O
my O
full O
and O
incremental O
hard O
drive O
backups O
( O
which O
go O
to O
an O
external O
hard O
drive).The O
drive O
itself O
has O
performed O
perfectly O
, O
and O
I O
have O
upgraded O
to O
the O
4 O
GB O
version.-----I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
trouble O
with O
the O
U3 O
on O
my O
two O
XP O
machines O
and O
one O
Win2k O
machine O
, O
although O
one O
friend O
's O
old O
Win2k O
( O
or O
was O
it O
98 O
? O
) O

I O
've O
have O
a O
collection O
of O
dead O
mice O
due O
to O
the O
dongle O
breaking O
because O
of O
this O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
skype O
just O
about O
everyday O
. O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
use O
all O
its O
features O
. O

Transfer O
speed O
on O
it O
is O
very O
good O
. O

When O
I O
told O
her O
that O
the O
order O
I O
connected O
the O
projector O
to O
my O
ipod O
touch O
was O
according O
to O
the O
written O
instructions O
. O

Only O
downside O
for O
not O
getting O
five O
stars O
is O
that O
its O
not O
as O
flexible O
as O
its O
shown O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

Very O
poor O
power O
supply O
. O

I O
then O
re O
- O
installed O
the O
original O
Apple O
memory O
and O
re O
- O
ran O
the O
tests O
. O

and O
I O
've O
injured O
myself O
many O
times O
because O
of O
that O
! O

I O
particularly O
enjoy O
the O
hard O
ballistic O
nylon O
which O
gives O
it O
a O
more O
solid O
feel O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
you O
need O
it O
though O
. O

light O
weight O
so O
easily O
moved O
while O
very O
stable O
. O

Found O
out O
( O
using O
search O
engines O
) O
that O
it O
is O
a O
production O
issue O
caused O
by O
the O
bottom O
lamp O
. O

I O
love O
the O
way O
it O
latches O
on O
to O
my O
monitor O
. O

it O
's O
sleek O
, O
great O
to O
hold O
, O
beautiful O
to O
look O
at O
( O
screen O
quality O
) O
and O
offers O
really O
strong O
performance O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
stay O
in O
the O
cradle O
when O
it O
's O
mounted O
on O
top O
of O
my O
PC O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
happy O
customer O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
my O
hubby O

As O
stated O
, O
some O
combinations O
of O
three O
keys O
( O
like O
Shift O
, O
Z O
, O
and O
X O
) O
do O
not O
register O
on O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
other O
reviewers O
that O
having O
an O
ungrounded O
transformer O
that O
accommodates O
grounded O
plugs O
seems O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O

I O
expected O
mediocrity O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
operation O
became O
intermittent O
and O
shortly O
afterwards O
it O
crapped O
out O
completely O
. O

, O
so O
we O
have O
to O
say O
that O
you O
bought O
the O
wrong O
products O
, O
pls O
kindly O
contact O
Amazon O
Service O
Support O
for O
refund O
directly O
, O
because O
our O
order O
is O
fulfilled O
by O
Amazon O
, O
any O
other O
question O
pls O
feel O
free O
to O
contact O
us O
. O

Love O
the O
Samsung O
Chrome O
Book O
, O
It;s O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
light O
weight O
! O

If O
you O
travel O
frequently O
, O
this O
is O
a O
lifesaver O
. O

The O
trackpad O
is O
close O
to O
worthless O
. O

The O
construction O
seemed O
fine O
and O
the O
backpack O
seemed O
ok O
when O
full O
. O

There O
are O
instructions O
you O
can O
find O
to O
disable O
Turbo O
Boost O
or O
you O
can O
use O
a O
program O
called O
ThrottleStop O
. O

And O
I O
just O
crank O
my O
mp3 O
player O
all O
the O
way O
up O
and O
, O
at O
night O
, O
everything O
's O
perfect O
volume O
to O
fall O
asleep O
to O
. O

, O
it O
came O
packaged O
better O
than O
the O
cheaper O
one O
. O

It O
's O
soft O
, O
yet O
with O
a O
firm O
. O

I O
had O
an O
RNX O
- O
N180PCe O
in O
my O
last O
comp O
and O
bought O
the O
updated O
model O
for O
my O
new O
comp O
. O

The O
original O
battery O
gave O
me O
maybe O
2 O
hours O
. O

it O
's O
also O
extremely O
portable O
. O

No O
extra O
engineering O
would O
have O
had O
to O
happen O
- O
it O
's O
just O
a O
piece O
of O
plastic O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
extra O
space O
between O
itself O
and O
the O
" O
guts O
" O
of O
the O
device O
. O

The O
netbook O
can O
run O
over O
10 O
hours O
even O
with O
USB O
accessories O
plugged O
in O
. O

I O
also O
use O
mine O
as O
a O
GPS O
display O
with O
MS O
Streets O
& O
Trips O
and O
as O
a O
dashboard O
via O
an O
OBD O
- O
II O
bluetooth O
interface O
. O

I O
've O
read O
early O
articles O
about O
Windows O
8 O
. O
1 O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
appear O
that O
Microsoft O
has O
gotten O
the O
message O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
larger O
hard O
drive O
and O
chip O
set O
. O

Nicely O
made O
and O
good O
quality O
. O

I O
'd O
easily O
give O
it O
5 O
if O
there O
was O
room O
INSIDE O
for O
this O
short O
cable O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
my O
ipad O
, O
I O
also O
have O
a O
mac O
book O
. O

( O
Dual O
N O
- O
protocol O
) O
it O
will O
have O
an O
occasional O
drop O
outs O
. O

If O
you O
found O
this O
review O
helpful O
or O
have O
questions O
/ O
comments O
, O
please O
let O
me O
know O
! O

The O
unit O
is O
still O
functioning O
. O

It O
's O
cheap O
and O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

I O
have O
added O
stickers O
to O
decorate O
the O
case O
. O

It O
also O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
the O
fankeeps O
it O
cool O
. O

I O
did O
get O
some O
error O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
install O
Itune O
, O
it O
said O
something O
about O
a O
missing O
DLL O
, O
I O
have O
not O
got O
time O
to O
troubleshoot O
. O

Tug O
softly O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
a O
cable O
and O
it O
extends O
. O

Was O
really O
surprised O
at O
how O
reasonably O
priced O
they O
were O
. O

At O
max O
volume O
it O
cuts O
the O
battery O
life O
down O
considerably O
but O
it O
still O
last O
3 O
or O
4 O
hours O
. O

It O
serves O
as O
a O
stand O
while O
it O
is O
attached O
. O

so O
this O
is O
always O
a O
good O
buy O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
this O
cable O
and O
both O
connectors O
on O
each O
end O
are O
quite O
firm O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
took O
about O
2 O
weeks O
due O
to O
holiday O
to O
get O
my O
laptop O
back O
. O

and O
I O
can O
also O
connect O
to O
the O
Internet O
via O
a O
wired O
modem O
connection O
, O
4 O

or O
3 O
G O
service O
via O
USB O
, O
or O
the O
pass O
- O
thru O
method O
mentioned O
above O
. O

This O
works O
perfectly O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
it O
is O
a O
short O
but O
sturdy O
adapter O
. O

First O
it O
did O
n't O
hold O
a O
charge O
for O
as O
long O
, O
then O
it O
needed O
to O
be O
plugged O
in O
to O
work O
, O
then O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
work O
while O
plugged O
in O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
remark O
would O
be O
that O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
laptop O
compartment O
is O
weak O
on O
padding O
, O
which O
most O
of O
these O
types O
of O

After O
buying O
this O
alloy O
steel O
speaker O
for O
someone O
, O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
the O
brand O
that O
was O
solid O
, O
and O
another O
speaker O
would O
do O
. O

It O
is O
very O
well O
made O
, O
it O
fits O
comfortable O
over O
the O
should O
and O
the O
handle O
is O
nice O
as O
well O
. O

The O
system O
is O
also O
expandable O
; O
you O
can O
buy O
individual O
Powerline O
units O
to O
connect O
other O
devices O
( O
TiVo O
, O
Google O
TV O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
to O
your O
network O
as O
needed O
. O

The O
most O
likely O
failure O
is O
at O
the O
USB O
connector O
. O

I O
was O
just O
looking O
for O
something O
cheap O
to O
protect O
my O
reader O
. O

I O
love O
the O
cotton O
dreams O
scent O
since O
it O
smells O
clean O
but O
is O
a O
really O
light O
scent O
. O

I O
really O
want O
to O
love O
this O
convertible O
. O

And O
for O
the O
record O
, O
my O
computer O
is O
connected O
to O
a O
720 O
HDTV O
via O
a O
VGA O
cable O
and O
male O
- O

male O
stereo O
cable O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
could O
work O
with O
a O
smaller O
screen O
. O

The O
shipping O
was O
quick O
and O
reasonable O
. O

The O
flash O
( O
interactive O
) O
demo O
/ O
tutorial O
is O
just O
silly O
as O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
plug O
it O
in O
. O

hoping O
to O
make O
it O
an O
easy O
chore O

Bran O

I O
still O
do O
my O
real O
work O
on O
my O
other O
computers O
, O
but O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
less O
screen O
- O
intensive O
things O
, O
like O
web O
browsing O
or O
playing O
some O

, O
this O
is O
my O
go O

I O
knew O
this O
was O
impossible O
since O
the O
shipping O
guys O
had O
just O
picked O
up O
the O
damaged O
set O
that O
morning O

sometimes O
it O
requieres O
to O
unplug O
your O
headphones O
and O
plug O
it O
back O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
being O
able O
to O
carry O
around O
my O
laptop O
and O
my O
books O
in O
the O
same O
bag O
. O

( O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
what O
her O
power O
settings O
are O
but O
safe O
to O
say O
it O
is O
NOT O
economy O
mode O
) O
. O

and O
that O
's O
exceptional O
, O
because O
I O
feel O
that O
way O
about O
no O
other O
notebook O
. O

If O
you O
use O
this O
in O
your O
hackintosh O
, O
it O
is O
recognized O
as O
native O
wifi O
, O
meaning O
you O
can O
use O
any O
apps O
/ O
programs O
that O
utilize O
native O
wifi O
only O
( O
chromecast O
, O
for O
instance O
) O
. O

I O
bought O
these O
headphones O
for O
a O
flight O
and O
was O
very O
disappointed O
. O

BTW O
, O
exercise O
is O
not O
a O
dirty O

Like O
so O
many O
others O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
device O
because O
it O
was O
reasonably O
priced O
when O
compared O
with O
Surface O
tablets O
sold O
directly O
from O
Microsoft O
or O
other O
vendors O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
getting O
maximum O
everything O
. O

Only O
complaint O
is O
it O
can O
expand O
rather O
deep O
, O
even O
without O
being O
too O
full O
. O

They O
're O
long O
enough O
to O
charge O
my O
phone O
while O
using O
it O
. O

Amazon O
delivered O
in O
a O
very O
timely O
fashion O
and O
it O
is O
very O
well O
packaged O
. O

This O
makes O
for O
one O
of O
those O
rare O
cases O
in O
computing O
where O
if O
you O
upgrade O
your O
hardware O
to O
a O
different O
brand O
, O
you O
might O
be O
able O
to O
use O
same O
drivers O
, O
or O
a O
version O
of O
the O
drivers O
that O
is O
only O
slightly O
newer O
. O

I O
found O
40 O
or O
so O
' O
upper O
channels O
' O
( O
channel O
numbers O
like O
76 O
- O
9 O
, O
77 O
- O
4 O
) O
had O
gone O
missing O
. O

com O
and O
had O
to O
return O
it O
. O

It O
is O
IPS O
, O
1080p O
, O
matte O
, O
wtih O
great O
viewing O
angles O
, O
color O
accuracy O
, O
amazing O
contrast O
and O
ample O
brightness O
. O

It O
was O
too O
high O
to O
fit O
in O
my O
T61 O
. O

1 O
- O
11"display O
without O
sacrificing O
performance O
. O

Plus O
, O
I O
typically O
use O
a O
computer O
for O
the O
Internet O
and O
office O
applications O
( O

If O
you O
really O
want O
speed O
, O
this O
should O
do O
well O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
- O
performance O
is O
great O
. O

I O
've O
used O
several O
devices O
of O
this O
style O
and O
this O
was O
the O
worst O
. O

And O
even O
if O
you O
put O
them O
together O
, O
the O
case O
will O
be O
either O
widely O
open O
or O
not O
completely O
closed O
. O

it O
's O
already O
installed O
... O
but O
go O
to O
" O
browse O
installable O
applications O
" O
and O
INSTALL O
it O
.. O
even O
though O
it O
's O
already O
on O
your O
system O
. O

Especially O
with O
ICS O
coming O
very O
soon O
. O

For O
someone O
who O
does O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
replace O
the O
SSD O
or O
who O
is O
scared O
of O
hurting O
the O
macbook O
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
I O
use O
it O
pert O
- O
near O
everyday O
. O

I O
've O
only O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
flash O
drive O
; O
other O
users O
report O
that O
it O
functions O
equally O
well O
with O
an O
external O
USB O
hard O
drive O
( O
presumably O
the O
GP1 O
supplies O
enough O
juice O
to O
fire O
up O
the O
drive O
) O
, O
and O
such O
external O
USB O
devices O
as O
cameras,(phones O
, O
MP3 O
... O
) O
. O

So O
this O
review O
is O
about O
the O
Sling O
Catcher O
. O

When O
I O
got O
my O
Motorola O
Xoom O
, O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
rooCASE O
for O
it O

Takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
. O

I O
plugged O
in O
my O
amp O
/ O
speakers O
into O
the O
headphone O
jack O
, O
the O
printer O
into O
a O
USB O
port O
, O
and O
its O
all O
running O
perfectly O
. O

So O
highly O
recommend O
the O
TV O
but O
maybe O
Samsung O
can O
put O
some O
angle O
in O
these O
screw O
holes O
on O
the O
bottom O
or O
magnetize O
the O
screws O
and O
then O
it O
will O
all O
be O
perfect O
. O

The O
price O
is O
right O
and O
quality O
is O
rite O
on O
. O

This O
is O
quite O
the O
upgrade O
though O
, O
the O
i5 O
is O
incredibly O
snappy O
and O
the O
video O
card O
is O
more O
than O
sufficient O
to O
play O
the O
games O
that O
are O
coming O
out O
. O

Now O
I O
no O
longer O
have O
to O
bring O
my O
power O
cord O
from O
the O
living O
room O
to O
the O
computer O
room O
. O

Fits O
nicely O
, O
looks O
cool O
, O
has O
a O
zipper O
. O

The O
almighty O
Air O
boon O
. O

took O
about O
18 O
minutes O
to O
set O
up O
the O
first O
time O
( O
no O
directions O
) O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
could O
be O
set O
up O
in O
about O
7 O
or O
8 O
minutes O
per O
light O
once O
I O
have O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
. O

But O
again O
it O
's O
not O
that O
much O
of O
a O
big O
deal O
as O
I O
intend O
to O
order O
a O
2 O
Gig O
RAM O
stick O
to O
make O
the O
system O
faster O
. O

Amazon O
sell O
really O
nice O
cables O
in O
any O
length O
. O

decent O
price O
for O
the O
size O
. O

I O
am O
currently O
using O
this O
in O
my O
bathroom O
while O
I O
shower O
. O

She O
loves O
it O
works O
good O

and O
I O
'm O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance O
of O
both O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
sturdy O
and O
very O
versatile O
means O
of O
transporting O
your O
notebook O
, O
its O
accessories O
, O
and O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
to O
boot O
, O
the O
RPB-117 O
is O
well O
worth O
your O
consideration O
. O

In O
retrospect O
, O
it O
might O
be O
more O
of O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

I O
returned O
the O
product O
shortly O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

The O
unit O
stays O
very O
cool O
even O
after O
hours O
of O
operation O
. O

This O
is O
a O
pro O
& O
con O
since O
it O
means O
that O
the O
strap O
wo O
n't O
pull O
on O
your O
suits O
either O
. O

it O
seems O
this O
is O
a O
poorly O
made O
product O
, O
will O
not O
want O
to O
buy O
again O

Fan O
speed O
is O
low O
, O
which O
is O
why O
its O
so O
quiet O
. O

The O
5400 O
rpm O
drive O
speed O
seems O
a O
little O
slow O
after O
a O
7200 O
desktop O
speed O
and O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
for O
serious O
games O
, O
however O
, O
for O
the O
beginner O
to O
average O
user O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
solid O
machine O
. O

This O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

This O
case O
is O
a O
good O
size O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
inexpensive O
wireless O
mouse O
you O
can O
take O
anywhere O
and O
use O
this O
is O
it O
. O

He O
would O
call O
us O
back O
within O
24 O
- O
48 O
hours O
, O
during O
a O
time O
convenient O
to O
us O
. O

It O
gives O
strong O
reception O
in O
almost O
every O
channel O
I O
've O
tried O
it O
, O
bear O
in O
mind O

But O
with O
or O
without O
the O
strap O
the O
laptop O
tends O
to O
move O
back O
and O
forth O
inside O
of O
the O
compartment O
. O

What O
I O
like O
about O
this O
ACER O
Aspire:1.- O

This O
mic O
is O
great O
for O
travel O
and O
great O
for O
my O
vista O
laptop O
that O
has O
the O
mic O
port O
in O
the O
front O
. O

Man O
I O
like O
this O
.. O

I O
have O
n't O
really O
used O
it O
. O

it O
rolls O
up O
or O
folds O
up O
and O
should O
be O
waterproof O
and O
dirt O
/ O
dust O
proof O
. O

It O
does O
NOT O
have O
a O
CD O
drive O
, O
but O
I O
have O
an O
external O
one O
. O

Though O
, O
when O
the O
video O
stops O
for O
a O
brief O
moment O
, O
like O
VHS O
tapes O
do O
when O
it O
changes O
pictures O
, O
it O
puts O
a O
watermark O
on O
the O
screen O
that O
says O
says O
the O
video O
quality O
, O
on O
the O
screen O
which O
is O
annoying O
when O
you O
are O
backing O
up O
memories O
.. O

msoft O
excel O
running O
, O
outlook O
is O
running O

now O
she O
is O
destroys O
the O
power O
supplies O
connector O
which O
is O
an O
ugly O
fix O

I O
wish O
the O
fan O
was O
a O
little O
stronger O

If O
you O
're O
worried O
about O
it O
being O
too O
old O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
disturbed O
by O
that O
. O

While O
the O
Dell O
has O
a O
slightly O
larger O
screen O
and O
a O
32 O
gb O
mSata O
. O

No O
option O
for O
this O
in O
system O
preferences O
. O

Let O
me O
go O
ahead O
and O
say O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
case O
to O
a O
friend O
who O
was O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O

how O
the O

Super O
happy O
with O

I O
love O
being O
able O
to O
use O
a O

with O
the O
setup O
! O

and O
they O
sounds O
killer O

With O
some O
cheaply O
- O
made O
enclosures O
, O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
free O
to O
rattle O
around O
inside O

The O

is O
a O
fairly O
miserly O

, O
although O
it O
is O
active O

and O
high O

But O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
me O
if O
there O
is O
something O
really O
wrong O
, O
that O
could O
cause O
more O

it O

comfortably O

I O
purchased O
this O
bag O
for O
my O
Dell O
XPS O
12 O
. O

Good O
for O
using O
as O
a O
remote O
shutter O
on O
iPhone O
or O
ipad O
and O
great O
for O
changing O
tracks O
while O
using O
my O
iPhone O
in O
the O
car O
stereo O
. O

Did O
n't O
think O
a O
router O
could O
optimize O
modem O
operation O
, O
but O
that O
's O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
changed O
in O
my O
setup O

it O
seems O
to O
not O
have O
the O
logic O
or O
& O

34;pins&#34 O
; O
inside O
the O
power O
plug O
into O
the O
computer O
to O
allow O
it O
to O
activate O
. O

The O
user O
manual O
says O
the O
following O
is O
included:"Universal O
power O
supply O
with O
international O
plug O
set"Which O
probably O
means O
you O
can O
plug O
this O
into O
any O
wall O
outlet O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

For O
me O
this O
is O
not O
an O
issue O
as O
I O
use O
it O
only O
with O
headphones O
. O

When O
I O
hook O
it O
to O
the O
hdmi O
monitor O
its O
just O
beautiful O
! O

I O
am O
using O
this O
to O
connect O
my O
bluetooth O
headphones O
to O
my O
Ubuntu O

. O

However O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
stay O
in O
my O
ear O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
speak O

So O
I O
am O
thinking O
- O
perhaps O
my O
Android O
Tablet O
can O
be O
my O
primary O
utility O
machine O

and O
the O

can O
be O

and O
does O
n't O
feel O
as O
back O
heavy O
as O
some O
other O
netbooks O

ultraportables O
that O
have O
6-cell O
batteries O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
an O
mSATA O
port O
, O
so O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
look O
for O
an O
SSD O
, O
and O
put O
the O
original O
hard O
drive O
on O
an O
external O

( O
or O

computer).Trackpad O
is O
horrendous O

Simply O
put O

a O
fully O
charged O

As O
for O
some O
of O
the O
features O
the O

brings O

A O
permanent O
fix O
would O
be O
to O
make O
sure O
any O
true O
full O
screen O
game O
/ O
app O
is O
set O
to O
the O
same O
resolution O
as O
your O
native O
resolution O
. O

The O
camera O
is O
otherwise O
good O

I O
purchased O
several O
of O
these O
TV O
's O
for O
resident O
rooms O
. O

It O
's O
a O
fast O
drive O
, O
and O
while O
it O
is O
n't O
quite O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
ADATA O
drive O
it O
will O
be O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
feel O
the O
difference O
in O
everyday O
tasks O
. O

It O
works O
really O
great O
. O

I O
attempted O
to O
detect O
channels O
with O
an O
antenna O
and O
cable O
, O
nothing O
. O

I O
have O
attached O
this O
product O
to O
all O
my O
lenses O
to O
keep O
from O
losing O
lens O
caps O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
( O
also O
a O
dinosaur O
) O
and O
still O
have O
ancient O
archives O
on O
floppy O
disks O
, O
at O
some O
point O
you O
're O
going O
to O
want O
to O
look O
at O
those O
files O
to O
see O
if O
they O
're O
worth O
keeping O
after O
all O
these O
years O
, O
or O
if O
they O
should O
just O
get O
the O
heave O
- O
ho O
. O

This O
is O
the O
rare O
occasion O
I O
felt O
compelled O
to O
write O
a O
review O
. O

They O
had O
the O
same O
camera O
for O
HALF O

You O
can O
toggle O
it O
on O
and O
off O
on O
the O
Dolby O
settings O
under O

I O
lost O
my O
charger O
for O
my O
HD O
and O
was O
a O
bit O
nervous O
finding O
another O
off O
brand O
charger O
- O
however O
this O
one O
worked O
out O
perfectly O
! O

Whenever O
I O
would O
play O
a O
cable O
stream O
audio O
would O
go O
completely O
nuts O
on O
the O
viewsonic O
. O

They O
sent O
an O
inquiry O
email O
shortly O
after O
receiving O
the O
battery O
, O
asking O
for O
initial O
feedback O
. O

I O
specifically O
bought O
this O
stand O
versus O
the O
one O
for O
the O
iPad2 O
because O
I O
have O
a O
cover O
on O
my O
iPad2 O
( O
Belkin O
Snap O
Shield O
for O

This O
Logitech O
keyboard O
is O
an O
attractive O
keyboard O
with O
a O
neat O
set O
of O
features O

With O

Bought O
this O
for O
an O

it O
works O
great O

It O

been O
at O

The O
only O
disconcerting O
factor O
was O
the O
number O
of O
pop O
- O
up O
ads O
inviting O
me O
to O
purchase O
or O
extend O
this O
or O
that O
program O
. O

I O
've O
only O
owned O
this O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
so O
far O
. O

Some O
reviewers O
found O
problems O
, O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
. O

However O
, O
the O
phones O
do O
a O
decent O
job O
at O
blocking O
out O
extraneous O
sound O
, O
just O
not O
as O
good O
as O
my O
Sennheiser O
. O

Since O
it O
is O
n't O
* O
designed O
* O
to O
fit O
the O
UV-5R+ O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
spend O
& O
# O
60;10 O
minutes O
with O
a O
Dremel O
to O
trim O
off O
some O
plastic O
and O
you O
're O
good O
to O
go O
! O

There O
is O
MUCH O
MUCH O
better O
speakers O
available O
for O
ALOT O
less O
money O
. O

A O
bit O
confusing O
to O
know O
when O
you O
should O
upload O
satellites O
to O
the O
device O
, O
and O
not O
sure O
what O
it O
means O
when O
satellites O
are O
popping O
in O
and O
out O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
front O
has O
pockets O
for O
accessories O
. O

but O
it O
does O
with O
windows O
xp O
/ O
vista/7 O
x86 O
and O
x64bits O

so O
they O
say O
it O
will O
get O
faster O
over O
time O
. O

It O
is O
so O
tiny O
... O
but O
I O
reserved O
judgement O
until O
I O
listened O
to O
the O
output O
... O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
and O
a O
welcome O
change O
over O
the O
black O
plastic O
tie O
- O
wraps O
that O
one O
frequently O
loses O
. O

I O
personally O
have O
a O
kindle O
, O
a O
tablet O
, O
2 O
ipods O
, O
and O
my O
smartphone O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
bass O
control O
knob O
setting O
, O
so O
I O
start O
to O
reduce O
the O
volume O
until O
all O
the O
way O
to O
minimum O
at O
7 O
o'clock O
setting O
. O

This O
back O
pack O
is O
very O
durable O
. O

They O
charged O
our O
phones O
, O
kindle O
and O
razors O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
is O
the O
little O
flip O
props O
on O
the O
back O
to O
elevate O
it O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
not O
a O
necessity O
though O
. O

It O
sits O
on O
my O
desk O
in O
my O
office O

I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
a O
while O
now O
and O
it O
still O
looks O
brand O
new O
. O

I O
am O
only O
thankful O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
buy O
it O
from O
BestBuy O
during O
Black O
Friday O
. O

However O
, O
after O
I O
use O
it O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
Ipad O
. O

benefit O
of O
installing O
SSD O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
hard O
drive O
noise O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
in O
the O
left O
palmrest O
area O
. O

I O
love O
that O
you O
can O
read O
third O
party O
apps O
such O
as O
Kindle O
, O
Google O
books O
and O
other O
readers O

While O
the O
Z570 O
is O
easier O
to O
tote O
around O
than O
a O
desktop O
and O
monitor O
, O
it O
is O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
the O
myriad O
of O
touchscreen O
tablets O
that O
many O
people O
carry O
these O
days O
. O

Company O
delivered O
quickly O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
accidentally O
unstrapping O
a O
metal O
buckle O
. O

But O
the O
worst O
part O
is O
that O
it O
will O
not O
stay O
plugged O
in O
. O

Very O
frustrating O
, O
just O
a O
terrible O
design O
change O
. O

its O
light O
design O
and O
power O
was O
too O
good O
of O
an O
offer O
to O
pass O
up O
. O

It O
's O
a O
shame O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
simply O
replace O
/ O
repair O
as O
the O
leather O
is O
in O
good O
shape O
. O

All O
of O
these O
programs O
run O
perfectly O
on O
these O
machines O
- O
they O
never O
freeze O
( O
as O
happens O
on O
laptops O
and O
computers O
) O
, O
and O
respond O
quickly O
to O
commands O
. O

I O
have O
an O
old O
surge O
protector O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
replaced O
on O
our O
dishwasher O
which O
has O
an O
electronic O
push O
button O
control O
panel O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
my O
son O
, O
he O
it O
12 O
and O
it O
is O
a O
small O
mouse O
that O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
use O
. O

Must O
be O
in O
an O
area O
with O
good O
digital O
broadcast O
signal O
or O
you O
will O
not O
get O
any O
reception O
. O

I O
also O
enabled O
the O
tracking O
feature O
so O
if O
I O
misplaced O
the O
computer O
( O
or O
if O
it O
was O
stolen O
) O
, O
I O
could O
find O
it O
. O

The O
top O
of O
the O
case O
snapped O
on O
extremely O
tight O
, O
which O
if O
I O
could O
get O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
case O
to O
snap O
on O
would O
not O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

I O
especially O
love O
the O
trackpad O
. O

I O
called O
the O
company O
again O
to O
see O
if O
they O
would O
be O
good O
enough O
to O
replace O
the O
router O
, O
since O
it O
was O
only O
2 O
days O
out O
of O
warranty O
, O
and O
they O
would O
n't O
hear O
of O
it O
. O

Windows O
8 O
runs O
perfectly O
fine O
on O
4Gb O
of O
memory O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
think O
what O
you O
need O
to O
put O
into O
this O
bag O
and O
arrange O
it O
in O
your O
head O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

so O
i O
think O
it O
works O
great O
..... O
KIDS O
.... O

Am O
planning O
a O
trip O
and O
do O
not O
expect O
good O
wifi O
. O

Orange O
provides O
great O
contrast O
while O
being O
warm O
enough O
to O
fight O
visual O
fatigue O
simultaneously O
. O

the O
default O
Windows O
color O
has O
always O
been O
purple O
and O
I O
've O
just O
been O
missing O
out O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
. O

Our O
family O
stepped O
in O
to O
deliver O
care O
, O
but O
there O
was O
one O
problem O
: O
No O
internet O
at O
the O
condominium O
in O
which O
he O
lives O
... O

I O
would O
rather O
it O
had O
been O
disabled O
by O
default O
, O
with O
options O
for O
users O
who O
want O
to O
try O
that O
input O
type O
that O
are O
converts O
from O
the O
iPad O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
I O
expected O
the O
enclosure O
to O
be O
much O
larger O
than O
it O
actually O
is O
. O

I O
see O
people O
complain O
that O
these O
units O
require O
a O
separate O
power O
cord O
and O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
an O
AC O
adapter O
brick O
to O
charge O
them O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
AC O
Adapter O
, O
it O
says O
it O
is O
for O
DV5 O
, O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
and O
it O
screw O
my O
battery O
in O
1 O
month O
and O
my O
laptop O
was O
new O
. O

It O
is O
still O
a O
bargain O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
to O
Apple O
's O
line O
up O
with O
iPad O
and O
the O
accessories O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
reviews O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
either O
be O
hit O
or O
miss O
. O

i O
absolute O
love O
my O
kindle O
case O
. O

Feels O
great O
! O

I O
have O
used O
it O
on O
Windows O
XP O
and O
Windows O
7 O
and O
it O
worked O
flawlessly O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
drop O
it O
or O
hit O
it O
with O
anything O

Which O
is O
better O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
AmazonBasics O
Netbook O
Sleeve O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
in O
the O
market O
for O
such O
a O
product O
. O

cpus)- O
Maybe O
i O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
enough O
to O
experience O
any O
other O
pros O
, O
but O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
'd O
liked O
on O
this O
computer O
so O
far O
has O
been O
its O
thin O
form O
factor O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
wide O
and O
large O
and O
yet O
I O
suffer O
from O
eye O
strain O
using O
this O
for O
extended O
periods O
( O
unlike O
my O
Alienware O
monitor O
I O
have O
plugged O
in O
) O
. O

And O
the O
audio O
is O
of O
higher O
quality O
than O
what O
comes O
from O
the O
laptop O
speakers O
. O

3 O
" O
Laptop O
as O
well O
as O
its O
cords O
and O
usb O
mouse O
. O

I O
went O
to O
WalMart O
, O
Kmart O
, O
Best O
Buy O
, O
Dollar O
Tree O
and O
NONE O
of O
their O
products O
gave O
out O
as O
much O
sound O
as O
these O
puppies O
! O
! O

I O
'm O
running O
Server O
2012 O
with O
Hyper O
- O
v O
on O
it O
for O
my O
test O
lab O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
length O
of O
the O
cord O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
the O
work O
of O
a O
super O
logical O
engineer O
who O
just O
could O
not O
stand O
to O
have O
those O
arrow O
keys O
in O
anything O
other O
than O
their O
" O
logical O
" O
configuration O
. O

So O
I O
found O
a O
refurbished O
model O
for O
$ O
159 O
dollars O
less O

This O
thing O
has O
gotten O
such O
glowing O
reviews O
from O
people O
not O
only O
here O
at O
Amazon O
, O
but O
quite O
a O
few O
other O
places O
that O
I O
figured O
the O
manufacturer O
had O
to O
have O
posted O
ringer O
reviewers O
all O
over O
the O
place O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
dupe O
people O
into O
buying O
their O
product O
. O

If O
you O
have O
an O
early O
wireless O
router O
, O
you O
have O
an O
open O
invitation O
for O
anyone O
to O
ride O
down O
the O
street O
with O
their O
laptop O
, O
and O
tap O
into O
your O
network O
. O

For O
me O
, O
the O
mix O
of O
portability O
and O
function O
were O
ideal O
. O

There O
certainly O
is O
room O
for O
it O
on O
the O
right O
side O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
protect O
it O
lol O
! O

It O
's O
in O
great O
shape O
and O
will O
not O
soon O
be O
replaced O
. O

I O
am O
very O
impressed O
with O
these O
cases O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
purchase O
from O
this O
seller O
. O

You O
may O
want O
to O
look O
to O
spending O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

We O
used O
them O
for O
hair O
irons O
, O
travel O
iron O
and O
cell O
phones O
. O

The O
sleeve O
's O
measurements O
are O
13 O
. O

This O
one O
is O
compact O
, O
grounded O
, O
and O
provides O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
current O
and O
voltage O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
decided O
I O
'd O
buy O
a O
small O
powered O
3 O
. O
0 O
hub O
to O
carry O
with O
me O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
cable O
is O
offered O
at O
the O
price O
it O
is O
given O
the O
quality O
of O
it O
. O

Setup O
was O
easy O
and O
without O
any O
heartaches O
. O

If O
you O
use O
it O
, O
be O
sure O
to O
cut O
it O
out O
just O
to O
your O
rounded O
edges O
so O
it O
does O
nt O
peel O
later O

Unplugging O
it O
makes O
it O
so O
that O
I O
can O
boot O
up O
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
acceptable O
. O

The O
little O
things O
keep O
falling O
off O
, O
and O
now O
my O
monitor O
is O
covered O
in O
sticky O
stuff O

. O

I O
'm O
being O
generous O
to O
give O
this O
batt O
. O

I O
'm O
used O
to O
a O
little O
hum O
or O
quiet O
buzz O
from O
speakers O
that O
are O
not O
received O
an O
audio O
signal O
, O
but O
still O
have O
power O
, O
but O
this O
sounds O
like O
a O
dying O
rabbit O
, O
and O
it O
's O
pretty O
loud O
. O

I O
solved O
the O
problem O
by O
going O
into O
the O
mouse O
settings O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
this O
one O
, O
it O
fit O
my O
needs O
exactly O
: O

She O
love O
the O
color O
red O
. O

This O
is O
apparently O
normal O
because O
the O
battery O
check O
is O
made O
for O
the O
8 O
cell O
battery O
and O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
the O
extra O
charging O
required O
by O
the O
4 O
extra O
cells O
. O

Carrying O
it O
around O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time O
was O
not O
really O
comfortable O
. O

.my O
time O
and O
anguish O
for O
36-days O
withstanding O
their O
condescending O
comments O
, O
ignorance O
, O
continuous O
unnecessary O
hanging O
up O
on O
me O
, O
rudeness O
, O
incompetent O
knowledge O
base O
and O
inability O
to O
work O
with O
persons O
with O
disabilities O
. O

Okay O
Monster O
, O
you O
left O
the O
leading O
edge O
features O
out O
to O
focus O
on O
sound O
, O
right O
? O

I O
can O
especially O
see O
this O
being O
helpful O
and O
convenient O
for O
travelers O
, O
since O
there O
's O
nothing O
worse O
than O
trying O
to O
plug O
in O
a O
Kindle O
or O

charger O
from O
a O
low O
or O
inconveniently O
placed O

, O
and O
having O
it O
not O
reach O
( O
or O
barely O
reach O
) O
the O
bedside O
table O
itself O
! O

best O
buy O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
laptop O
. O

That O
's O
pretty O
awesome O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

First O
, O
I O
looked O
at O
this O
feature O
before O
buying O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
new O
laptops O
with O
the O
newer O
" O
i O
" O
processors O
seem O
to O
run O
cooler O
than O
older O
models O
. O

even O
my O
hubby O
with O
larger O
hands O
does O
n't O
mind O
it O
. O

Regardless O
, O
it O
manages O
fine O
and O
should O
n't O
be O
a O
problem O
for O
anyone O
. O

product O
met O
mine O
and O
my O
gift O
recipients O
expectations O

It O
failed O
two O
days O
after O
the O
three O
months O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
install O
an O
IP O
camera O
on O
a O
radio O
tower O
. O

( O
There O
will O
be O
two O
clips O
holding O
on O
each O
left O
/ O
ride O
side O
of O
the O
screen O
, O
and O
two O
holding O
onto O
the O
edge O
above O
the O
iSight O
camera O
) O

They O
also O
added O
velcro O
silencers O
which O
help O
diminish O
velcro O
noise O
pollution O
. O

I O
went O
to O
iFixits O
website O
and O
followed O
the O
instructions O
to O
the O
dot O
. O

Canon O
has O
sample O
videos O
on O
their O
site O
if O
you O
want O
to O
check O
it O
out O
; O
vimeo O
. O

The O
charger O
arrived O
yesterday O
and O
immediately O
worked O
with O
our O
Dell O
providing O
a O
strong O
/ O
quick O
charge O
. O

If O
you O
google O
around O
, O
you O
will O
find O
many O
references O
to O
problems O
with O
the O
Wifi O
on O
this O
product O
. O

I O
am O
still O
keeping O
the O
Gizmo O
Dorks O
case O
, O
as O
the O
wallet O
fits O
in O
there O
and O
there O
is O
a O
storage O
pocket O
for O
the O
adapter O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
try O
it O
( O
and O
have O
the O
proper O
port O
) O
then O
give O
it O
a O
try O

There O
are O
widespread O
problems O
with O
this O
particular O
power O
adapter O
model O
with O
this O
revision O
of O
the O
model O
as O
they O
are O
prone O
to O
failure O
due O
to O
a O
design O
flaw O
in O
one O
of O
three O
wires O
inside O
the O
single O
cable O
that O
goes O
from O
the O
adapter O
to O
the O
laptop O
and O
in O
a O
identifier O
chip O
inside O
the O
adapter O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
availible O
in O
about O
5 O
colors O
. O

The O
only O
part O
of O
it O
that O
I O
think O
should O
be O
different O
and O
better O
is O
the O
zipper O
, O
which O
could O
be O
more O
heavy O
duty O
. O

The O
second O
issue O
is O
that O
the O
space O
bar O
does O
not O
work O
well O
. O

They O
require O
up O
to O
48 O
hours O
to O
respond O
to O
email O
requests O
( O
are O
they O
seriously O
under O
- O
staffed?)3 O
. O

I O
've O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
performance O
of O
this O
laptop O
charger O
and O
have O
absolutely O
nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
it O
! O

Perfect O
for O
those O
who O
already O
have O
a O
rolling O
bag O
for O
other O
gear O
( O
light O
stands O
/ O
tripods O
/ O
lighting O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
worry O
about O
having O
to O
roll O
a O
2nd O
one O
. O

Oh O
why O
oh O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
make O
a O
better O
cord O
? O

so O
if O
you O
do O
too O
, O
this O
is O
the O
correct O
keyboard O
replacement O
. O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
... O

Have O
n't O
used O
this O
much O
yet O
; O
however O
, O
so O
far O
it O
is O
great O
. O

and O
I O
open O
the O
box O
. O

Matches O
perfectly O
! O

Even O
the O
stitched O
area O
on O
the O
perimeter O
of O
the O
chair O
's O
arms O
began O
irritating O
my O
elbows O
. O

The O
name O
of O
company O
is O

For O
example O
, O
if O
I O
were O
to O
get O
a O
tip O
for O
my O
Sanyo O
SCP-8100 O
cell O
phone O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
buy O
an O

in O
addition O
to O
the O

Site O

this O

even O
with O
Roxio O
bad O
tech O
support O
and O
I O
AM O
a O
computer O
tech O

And O
it O
has O
plenty O
of O
volume O
. O

I O
give O
props O
to O
AMD O
for O
making O
such O
a O
good O
processor O
with O
awesome O
graphics O
, O
the O
best O
part O
of O
the O
laptop O
is O
n't O
anything O
toshiba O
did O
. O

This O
was O
because O
the O
router O
would O
not O
send O
a O
constant O
wireless O
signal O
. O

I O
bought O
them O
to O
use O
at O
my O
office O
and O
every O
now O
and O
then O
, O
I O
turn O
them O
up O

it O
's O
short O
lifespan O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
speak O
for O
battery O
drain O
since O
I O
keep O
my O
computer O
plugged O
in O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
satisfied O
customer O
and O
do O
nt O
let O
the O
negative O
reviews O
deter O
you O
from O
trying O
it O
out O
. O

Another O
note O
on O
the O
Thrive O
: O

In O
short O
, O
there O
are O
alternative O
portable O
speakers O
with O
deeper O
bass O
and O
fuller O
sound O
, O
but O
they O
are O
bulkier O
, O
heavier O
and O
cost O
a O
good O
bit O
more O
. O

If O
you O
love O
to O
add O
a O
very O
soft O
but O
pleasant O
color O
to O
your O
Mac O
Air O
but O
also O
have O
a O
hard O
case O
I O
have O
to O
suggest O
you O
grab O
the O
Belkin O
Shield O
EdgeGlow O
Case O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
board O
first O
if O
you O
own O
this O
bag O
. O

We O
got O
the O
new O
screen O
in O
and O
unfortunately O
the O
screen O
did O
nt O
work O
! O

I O
can O
place O
this O
button O
next O
to O
my O
keyboard O
and O
hide O
the O
actual O
hub O
/ O
switch O
behind O
my O
monitor O
. O

i O
upgraded O
the O
2 O
GB O
RAM O
to O
4 O
GB O
for O
about O
$ O
45 O
. O

I O
used O
them O
w/ O
a O
external O
antenna O
and O
it O
helped O
boost O
my O
signal O
. O

would O
have O
bought O
one O
at O
best O
buy O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend$60 O
- O
120 O
and O
use O
all O
of O
the O
money O
my O
relatives O
gave O
me O
. O

that O
I O
know O
the O
gig O
. O

Other O
reviews O
said O
that O
the O
pack O
will O
let O
you O
run O
longer O
, O
but O
it O
will O
not O
recharge O
your O
battery O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
got O
this O
, O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
several O
days O
- O
so O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
the O
Asus O
is O
n't O
as O
thin O
, O
but O
that O
's O
because O
it O
has O
stuffed O
so O
much O
inside O
, O
so O
the O
metal O
is O
thicker O
and O
feels O
extremely O
sturdy O
even O
compared O
with O
its O
slightly O
cheaper O
Q550LF O

It O
also O
took O
ten O
minutes O
to O
sync O
up O
when O
plugged O
in O
. O

Odd O
, O
I O
purchased O
same O
battery O
previously O
from O
same O
vendor O
and O
it O
worked O
. O

For O
the O
small O
difference O
in O
$ O
$ O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
other O
one O
over O
this O
one O
. O

and O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
dud O

Been O
struggling O
through O
the O

for O
the O
past O
8 O

bad O

as O
they O
did O
to O
me O

My O

If O
you O

the O

Everything O
you O
need O
. O

I O
followed O
other O
people O

that O
I O
found O
here O
, O
and O
I O
low O

the O

before O

If O
this O
is O
your O
first O

it O

The O
initial O

was O
too O
fast O
, O
but O
easily O
fixed O
in O

. O

In O
my O
second O
test O
, O
I O
attached O
the O
device O
directly O
to O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
's O
USB O

0 O
port O
using O
ONLY O
the O
data O
cable O
-- O
again O
, O
it O
powered O
up O
and O
worked O
flawlessly O
. O

My O
ranking O
is O
based O
on O
it O
meeting O
my O
needs O
and O
not O
of O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
cable O
itself O
. O

It O
's O
super O
comfortable O
, O
huge O
, O
has O
great O
padding O
to O
protect O
your O
gear O
, O
offers O
several O
ways O
to O
access O
the O
goods O
, O
and O
looks O
pretty O
snazzy O
. O

I O
sure O
hope O
the O
next O
apple O
Macbooks O
have O
eSATA O
or O
USB3 O
. O

I O
mounted O
a O

I O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
for O
those O
needing O
a O
budget O
friendly O
laptop O
for O
daily O
tasks O
and O
light O
workloads O
. O

I O
am O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
Apple O
products O
, O
they O
are O
pricey O
but O
usually O
make O
up O
for O
that O
in O
sleek O
design O
and O
quality O
, O
the O
only O
exception O
been O
the O
11 O
" O
Macbook O
Air O
which O
worked O
perfectly O
at O
first O
but O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
it O
started O
to O
slow O
down O
to O
a O
crawl O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
particularly O
attactive O
body O
, O
but O
it O
is O
functional O
. O

, O
it O

overwhelming O

The O
price O
is O
a O

more O

I O
could O
have O

a O
regular O

was O
1/4 O

this O
one O
( O

the O
original O
) O
and O
that O
one O
did O
not O
work O

this O
one O
works O
just O
fine O

It O
also O
holds O
all O

The O
FW O
laptop O
( O
which O
has O
a O
more O
rectangular O

fits O

the O

it O

uses O
the O

as O
the O

it O
would O
be O
a O
worthy O

likely O
simple O

Someone O
said O
that O
when O
looking O
at O
the O
same O
price O
point O
most O
laptops O
have O
the O
same O
specs O
, O
so O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
feel O
, O
aesthetics O
, O
and O
customer O
service O
- O
great O
summation O
! O
) O

This O
laptop O
case O
has O
much O
more O
room O
than O
it O
appears O
when O
you O
look O
at O
the O
bag O
. O

I O
have O
three O
white O
- O
on O
- O
aluminum O
Apple O
chicklet O
keyboards O
, O
and O
I O
love O
the O
feel O
, O
but O
wish O
they O
were O
slightly O
less O
ostentatious O
. O

On O
my O
recent O
flight O
to O
Kauai O
, O
slipped O
on O
my O
ear O
buds O
and O
the O
6 O
hr O
flight O
zipped O
by O
while O
watching O
my O
favorite O
vids O
and O
reading O
my O
books O
- O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
keyboard O
dock O
for O
extra O
battery O
life O
. O

I O
love O
this O
case O

First O
is O
your O

old O

Sorry O
, O
but O
that O
's O
just O
cheesy O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
increase O

for O

11 O
January O
2014:It O
has O
been O
almost O
a O
month O
since O
I O
first O
published O
a O
review O
and O

That O
's O
pretty O
much O
it O
, O
one O
last O
thing O
though O
-the O
laptop O
supports O
dynamic O
brightness O
. O

If O
there O
is O
any O
negative O
feature O
, O
it O
might O
be O
the O
net O
weight O
and O
that O
would O
only O
be O
a O
factor O
if O
it O
is O
being O
purchased O
for O
someone O
small O
or O
partially O
disabled O
. O

I O
like O
the O
' O
over O
the O
ear O
' O
design O
. O

This O
unit O
really O
does O
not O
even O
move O
enough O
air O
to O
cool O
a O
laptop O
's O
bottom O
plate O
. O

The O
SSD O
was O
on O
sale O
one O
day O
for O
$ O
150 O
( O
purchase O
date O
from O
Newegg O
22 O
May O
2012 O
) O
.. O

I O
'm O
just O
hoping O
I O
do O
n't O
encounter O
the O
same O
problems O
as O
I O
've O
had O
with O
this O
ultrabook O
. O

The O
good O
folks O
at O
Sharkk O
sent O
me O
this O
mouse O
and O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
review O
it O
honestly O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
the O
bundled O
connectors O
are O
useless O
as O
none O
of O
them O
are O
right O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
found O
the O
cable O
to O
be O
of O
good O
construction O
. O

I O
tried O
the O
Apple O
Magic O
Mouse O

Does O
n't O
use O
apt O
- O
x O
codec O
, O
the O
AC O
adapter O
's O
LED O
is O
bright O
enough O
to O
light O
up O
my O
bedroom O

It O
'll O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
it O
holds O
up O
to O
wear.- O
DesignI O
love O
having O
compartments O
for O
every O
gadget O
that O
goes O
along O
in O
my O
bag O
, O
and O
this O
bag O
provides O
a O
good O
variety O
of O
clever O
pockets O
and O
compartments O
so O
that O
everything O
has O
its O
place O
. O

All O
of O
these O
devices O
appear O
to O
be O
cheaply O
made O
, O
and O
are O
not O
costly O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
another O
manufacturer O
. O

The O
size O
is O
a O
good O
compromise O
with O
an O
optical O
drive O
. O

As O
noted O
, O
it O
digs O
into O
my O
hand O
. O

They O
are O
equivalent O
to O
my O
expensive O
wallet O
that O
I O
have O
had O
for O
several O
years O
. O

I O
'd O
HIGHLY O
recommend O
picking O
one O
up O
from O
Red O
Tag O
- O
if O
your O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
solid O
, O
cheap O
, O
slug O
of O
a O
laptop O
- O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
in O
getting O
one O
of O
these O
- O
just O
remember O
- O
these O
babies O
came O
out O
in O
2009 O
- O
so O
do O
n't O
expect O
this O
thing O
to O
compare O
with O
a O
i3 O
or O
i5 O
etc O
- O
what O
you O
get O
out O
of O
the O
box O
is O
a O
solid O
little O
laptop O
to O
surf O
, O
some O
SIMPLE O
word O
processing O
etc O
- O
do O
n't O
expect O
this O
thing O
to O
rock O
w O
/ O
gig O

's O
in O

- O
it O
's O
a O
SOLID O

little O

laptop O
- O
beat O
's O
the O
other O
used O
slugs O
out O
there O
from O

... O

I O
'd O
recommend O
the O

app O

, O
but O
there O
are O
others O
to O
choose O
from O

WHITE O
GLOVE O
DELIVERY O

The O
price O
was O
n't O
excessive O
, O
but O
the O
performance O
is O
definitely O
below O
par O
for O
what O
was O
billed O
as O
a O
high O
capacity O
battery O
. O

I O
've O
had O
some O
complaints O
, O
including O
a O
few O
performance O
related O
, O
but O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O

If O
it O

, O
then O
go O

search O
for O

open O

I O
did O
a O

so O
I O
've O
been O
dreaming O
of O
a O

The O

I O
've O
been O

for O
three O

an O
completely O
delighted O
with O
it O

But O
as O
a O

, O
it O
has O
n't O
given O
me O
any O
trouble O

exactly O

me O
again O

I O

to O

This O
is O
not O
for O
the O

The O

that O

As O
I O

I O

noticing O
that O
I O
am O
typing O

on O

using O
a O

I O

for O
about O
2 O

November O

over O
a O

( O
1 O

and O
now O
every O
time O
I O

where O
the O

is O
so O
loose O
the O

Works O
well O
for O
the O
price O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
for O
sure O
. O

Fitment O
is O
perfect O

it O
looks O

I O
installed O
this O
myself O
and O
have O
used O
it O
for O
about O
a O
week O
now O
. O

Did O
a O
Google O
search O
on O
how O
to O

So O
, O

this O

I O
bought O
this O

over O
the O

at O

on O
the O
strong O

'd O
sold O
tons O
of O
them O
and O
has O
never O
heard O
the O
first O
complaint O
-- O
he O
was O
right O

The O
build O
quality O
is O
good O
and O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
car O

locks O

Has O
the O
basic O
power O
to O

work O
on O

and O
get O
some O

done O
while O
on O

It O
was O
great O
when O
it O
worked O

The O

quite O
good O

the O

the O
most O
important O
( O

item O
of O

there O

I O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
not O

it O

had O
bought O
it O
for O
my O

did O
n't O
really O
have O
time O
to O
start O
the O

over O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
do O

care O

is O
the O
blue O

This O

is O
a O
nice O

between O
a O

I O
believe O
you O
can O
purchase O
adhesive O
covers O
much O

the O

it O

That O
feature O
was O
one O
of O
the O
factors O
in O
buying O
it O
. O

No O
worries O
, O
though O
. O

So O
i O
finally O
settled O
on O
the O
Sony O

which O
will O
arrive O

a O
couple O
days O

A O
couple O
of O
thoughts O
on O
this O
filter O
: O
The O
Good:- O

This O
unit O
really O
picks O
up O
weak O
WiFi O
signals O
- O
which O
is O
great O
if O
you O
are O
in O
an O
area O
with O
very O
few O
WiFi O
's O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
test O

= O
right O
click O
, O
scrolling O
websites O
up O
and O
down O
with O
2 O
fingers O
, O
etc O
... O
so O
sweet O
. O

I O
bought O
these O
for O
their O
main O
purpose O
, O
to O
connect O
by O
studio O
monitors O
( O
KRK O
G2 O

) O
to O
my O
computer O
. O

For O
small O
things O
, O
like O
fetching O
web O
pages O
or O
short O
downloads O
, O
its O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

First O
, O
my O
laptop O
fits O
perfectly O
on O
this O
pad O
, O
giving O
room O
to O
move O
the O
laptop O
up O
or O
down O
the O
pad O
for O
better O
cooling O
experiences O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
disappointed O
that O
I O
have O
to O
fight O
my O
laptop O
to O
get O
it O
in O
this O
bag O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
fast O
laptop O
when O
you O
have O
an O
SSD O
installed O

so O
searched O
amazone O

found O
you O

would O
need O
to O
be O
set O
up O
with O
the O
delivery O
company O
. O

The O
enclosure O
felt O
somewhat O
faulty O
to O
me O
, O
and O
gave O
me O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
might O
fail O
me O
when O
i O
need O
it O
the O
most O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
it O

Plenty O

experience O
is O
that O
the O
small O

of O
this O

reduces O
my O
carpel O

considerably O
. O

The O

it O

my O

I O

in O
1 O
minute O
they O
credited O

account O
for O
the O
difference O

Okay O
, O
first O
off O
I O
ordered O
this O
for O
my O
pc O
. O

Plug O
it O
in O
, O
and O
it O
works O
perfectly O
. O

The O
contrast O
is O
stunning O
, O
the O
blacks O
are O
deep O
and O
the O
color O
production O
is O
more O
than O
satisfying O
. O

It O
's O
a O

( O

) O
, O
which O
I O
usually O
dislike O

Ok O
, O
I O
REALLY O
like O
this O
thing O
. O

Like O
fry O
an O
egg O
on O
it O
hot O
. O

This O
impeccable O
device O
is O
worthy O
of O
all O
commendation O
. O

the O
one O
he O
got O
with O
it O
he O
said O
was O
alot O
of O
times O
too O
short O
depending O
on O
where O
he O
had O
to O
plug O
it O
in O

In O
One O

Packaging O

Blackplus O
my O
android O
phone O
no O
problem O
. O

The O
computer O
still O
recognizes O
them O
, O
the O
controls O
still O
work O
, O
just O
NO O
sound O
comes O
out O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
charge O
my O
iPod O
Touch O
and O
Blackberry O
simultaneously O
by O
just O
using O
USB O
cables O
. O

After O
a O
few O
tweaks O
, O
everything O
is O
working O
really O
nicely O
. O

The O
mouse O
is O
a O
smaller O
than O
I O
thought O
, O
the O
mouse O
I O
bought O
to O
work O
with O
my O
nexus O
10 O

The O
backpack O
is O
nice O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
compartments O
, O
and O
feels O
well O
- O
constructed O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
purchasing O
this O
battery O
, O
which O
at O
the O
time O
was O
~$45 O
. O

However O
, O
I O
immediately O
set O
to O
testing O
the O
Shutdown O
issue O
described O
in O
the O
discussion O
threads O
here O
, O
and O
sure O
enough O
, O
I O
duplicated O
the O
problem O
where O
about O
3 O
out O
of O
every O
5 O
times O
under O
battery O
power O
, O
the O
machine O
does O
n't O
fully O
shut O
down O
unless O
the O
power O
button O
is O
held O
down O
for O
several O
seconds O
. O

Before O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
look O
up O
the O
widespread O
problem O
with O
the O
intermittent O
wireless O
connections O
. O

but O
apparently O
they O
do O
as O
the O
old O
tube O
sets O
. O

Use O
it O
to O
store O
my O
EOS O
7D O
with O
EFS O

This O
dock O
also O
holds O
my O
KF O
in O
the O
leather O
case O
I O
have O
for O
it O
too O
. O

It O
's O
the O
usual O
dilemma O
with O
the O
13 O
" O
boasting O
pretty O
much O
better O
specs O
and O
battery O
life O
than O
the O
11 O
" O
. O

There O
is O
a O
true O
250 O
gb O
harddrive O
which O
many O
are O
replacing O
with O
an O
SSD O
for O
faster O
access O
and O
longer O
battery O
life O
. O

that O
I O
kind O
of O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
the O
thing O

In O
this O
compartment O
is O
also O
a O
pouch O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
a O
cell O
phone O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
loops O
for O
pens O
etc O
. O

I O
used O
three O
of O
the O
four O
items O
. O

I O
tried O
fix- O

I O
've O
been O
playing O
some O
MMORPGs O
as O
well O
as O
throwback O
horror O
survival O
games O
on O
it O
, O
and O
have O
been O
impressed O
. O

It O
is O
nice O
and O
long O

I O
would O
also O
recommend O
using O
it O
in O
conjunction O
with O
Rendezvous O
( O
free O
download O
from O
Apple O
) O
for O
Macs O
or O
Bonjour O
( O
free O
from O
Apple O
again O
) O
for O
PC O
's O
to O
automatically O
identify O
your O
network O
printers O
and O
select O
the O
one O
you O
want O
to O
print O
to O
. O

I O
am O
using O
this O
with O
my O
existing O
wireless O
phone O
system O
. O

Had O
to O
send O
it O
to O
HP O
for O
repair O
. O

The O
suspension O
system O
is O
pretty O
worthless O
if O
you O
're O
a O
lens O
hood O
kind O
of O
guy O
. O

But O
what O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
is O
that O
I O
can O
not O
adjust O
the O
volume O
when O
it O
is O
this O
mode O
! O

The O
software O
is O
reasonably O
quick O
to O
load O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
, O
professional O
grade O
unit O
. O

After O
hours O
and O
hours O
of O
hunting O
on O
Amazon O
for O
the O
right O
backpack O
I O
finally O
chose O
this O
one O
. O

It O
saved O
SO O
MUCH O
ROOM O
, O
and O
made O
everything O
so O
much O
easier O
! O

No O
fault O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
of O
course O
! O

and O
I O
am O
more O
of O
a O
power O
user O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

I O
like O
how O
you O
can O
positions O
the O
fans O
where O
you O
like O
, O
for O
my O
HP O
dv7 O
- O
2040us O

I O
ordered O
this O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
back O
- O
up O
for O
my O
original O
adapter O
, O
and O
it O
works O
perfectly O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

I O
would O
reccomend O
this O
product O
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
backpack O
camera O
bag O
. O

It O
has O
been O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
even O
considering O

TO O
MAKE O
IT O
ACT O

Nothing O
bulges O
noticeably O
, O

Do O
nt O
expect O
this O
device O
will O
work O

I O
'm O
giving O
the O
3 O

rating O
based O
on O
the O
poor O

Loudness O
Control O
- O
There O
is O
NO O

so O
it O
is O
best O
to O
have O
the O
tablet O
or O
the O
phone O
as O
close O
to O
the O
speaker O
as O
possible O
to O
regulate O
the O
sound O

Will O
not O
charge O
my O

using O
either O
the O
samsung O
or O
a O
generic O

. O

I O
would O
disconnect O
and O
reconnect O
the O
device O
and O
" O
voila O
" O
they O
would O
work O
again O
for O
an O
undetermined O
period O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
I O
had O
intended O
to O
plug O
this O
into O
an O
external O
monitor O
but O
the O
screen O
size O
of O
the O
laptop O
is O
almost O
as O
big O
as O
my O
monitor O

But O
my O
drive O
had O
been O
shut O
down O
correctly O
so O
again O

I O
already O
have O
a O
few O
of O
Mediabridge O
's O
HDMI O
cables O
, O
so O
I O
knew O
this O
one O
would O
be O
good O
quality O
. O

Sigh O
... O
this O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
product O
. O

I O
bought O
two O
for O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
and O
have O
used O
them O
most O
evenings O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
and O
they O
both O
perform O
fantastic O
. O

This O
morning O
, O
I O
got O
another O
call O
from O
the O
StrongVolt O
guy O
, O
" O
calling O
to O
follow O
up O

and O
again O
, O
asking O
if O
I O
would O
delete O
or O
change O

) O
and O
seems O
to O
perform O
just O
as O
well O
. O

For O
this O
price O
, O
especially O
compared O
to O
an O
original O
on O
Dell O
. O

This O
actually O
remains O
darker O
so O
you O
can O
charge O
at O
night O
, O
without O
it O
blinding O
you O
while O
you O
sleep O
. O

If O
it O
were O
plugged O
in O

it O
would O
fall O
over O
and O
make O
an O
amplified O
thwack O

instead O
of O
a O

A O

be O

good O
construction O
materials O
( O
not O
heavy O
steel O

my O

stuff O
) O

but O
considering O
you O
need O
to O
pick O
these O
up O
and O
move O
them O
round O
during O
a O
day O
of O
studio O
shooting O
they O
move O
into O
the O
really O
good O
category O
. O

At O
first O
it O
will O
sound O
a O
bit O
constricted O
and O
one O

( O
much O
like O
the O
mass O
market O
units O
even O
after O
they O
had O
been O
played O
for O
several O
weeks O
) O
. O

This O
has O
been O
surprisingly O
handy O
for O
charging O
my O
phone O
and O
tablet O

out O

tight O
places O

I O
use O
it O
anyway O

my O
laptop O
hangs O
over O
the O

needs O
readjusting O
sometimes O

PROBLEM O

I O
bought O
these O

on O

and O
they O
're O
still O
working O

I O
like O
this O
product O
, O
and O
for O
the O
price O
point O
, O
if O
you O
get O
sick O
of O
the O
color O
, O
is O
inexpensive O
enough O
to O
order O
another O
one O
and O
swap O
them O
out O
. O

Cord O
is O
a O
good O
length O
, O
which O
is O
good O
because O
it O
takes O
some O
moving O
around O
the O
room O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
a O
proper O
signal O
. O

SD O
slot O
for O
extra O
storage O
. O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
protect O
from O
dust O
and O
scratches O
. O

When O
this O
laptop O
works O
it O
is O
just O
a O
joy O
. O

The O
flashdrives O
come O
with O
this O
vault O
that O
password O
protects O
your O
files O
if O
you O
want O
. O

Works O
as O
it O
should O
, O
so O
far O
. O

I O
have O
to O
write O
at O
least O
20 O
words O
to O
get O
the O
review O
in O
! O
! O
! O

We O
immediately O
formatted O
to O
Windows O
7 O
Professional O
and O
it O
runs O
like O
a O
champ O
! O

It O
has O
one O
large O
pocket O
for O
the O
extras O
, O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
that O
works O
well O
and O
handles O
. O

Totally O
pleased O
with O
the O
price O
and O
performance O
of O
this O
item O
. O

There O
is O
no O
parallel O
port O
on O
this O

you O
will O
need O
to O
purchase O
a O
parallel O

After O
installing O
my O
suite O
of O
apps O
, O
27 O
GB O
of O
free O
space O
was O
still O
left O
on O
the O
internal O
storage O
. O

Also O
, O
this O
adapter O
was O
$ O
20 O
cheaper O
than O
the O
one O
I O
was O
going O
to O
buy O
off O
of O
a O
major O
computer O
shop O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
no O
sense O
mentioning O
thier O
name O
. O

Most O
notably O
apps O
like O
& O

Rope&#34 O

I O
know O
this O
might O
be O
a O
one O
off O
case O
, O
but O
in O
my O
case O
, O
this O
battery O
did O
not O
work O
. O

Works O
great O
but O
the O
hinge O
that O
is O
used O
to O
clip O
the O
Amp O
comes O
loose O
and O
the O
spring O
comes O
off O
and O
can O
be O
lost O
. O

The O
hardware O
itself O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
fine O
, O
but O
I O
lost O
an O
hour O
of O
my O
life O
trying O
to O
make O
D O
- O
Link O
's O
drivers O
work O
. O

Optical O
drives O
are O
a O
dying O
breed O
, O
like O
floppy O
drives O
... O

They O
are O
loud O
enough O
to O
hear O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
enough O
for O
me O

It O
is O
an O
enormous O
bag O
. O

The O
card O
plus O
shipping O
was O
less O
than O
$ O
12 O
. O

The O
construction O
seems O
sturdy O
. O

What O
matters O
to O
me O
most O
when O
considering O
to O
buy O
a O
camcorder O
is O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
low O
lux O
, O
its O
terrible O
when O
you O
ca O
n't O
record O
decent O
footage O
when O
the O
lights O
are O
dim O
, O
this O
camcorder O
is O
satisfactory O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
recording O
in O
low O
light O
indoors O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
clean O
various O
screens O
of O
finger O
print O
smudges O
with O
fine O
cloths O
. O

I O
have O
a O
business O
- O
class O
laptop O
with O
2nd O
Gen O
i7 O
and O
it O
was O
running O
between O
125 O
and O
130 O
degrees O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
other O
options O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
yet O

does O
get O
smudgy O
. O

But O
if O
you O
need O
to O
use O
Windows O
often O
and O
need O
performance O
( O
even O
low O
intensity O
applications O
like O
Microsoft O
Word O
are O
a O
bit O
sluggish O
under O
VMware O
) O
then O
you O
should O
think O
long O
and O
hard O
about O
buying O
a O
Macbook O

a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O

Dissatisfied O
, O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
another O

to O

with O
rude O

Ordered O

But O
the O
downsides O
-- O
The O
mouse O
pad O
is O
a O
joke O
, O
it O
constantly O
confuses O
a O
touch O
with O
a O

so O
you O
will O
drag O
or O
select O
things O
you O
did O
not O

and O
the O
reactions O
are O
not O

My O
laptop O
is O
six O
years O
old O
and O
weighs O
a O
ton O
. O

and O
I O
did O
so O
, O
and O
it O
works O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
Anker O
battery O
because O
I O
own O
two O
other O
Anker O
products O
and O
they O
are O
great O
. O

We O
love O
them O
, O
and O
plan O
on O
getting O
more O
! O

I O
am O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
this O
units O
ability O
to O
maintain O
a O
charge O
while O
not O
in O
use O
. O

Some O
had O
mentioned O
that O
they O
were O
unhappy O
with O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
much O
of O
it O
until O
I O
used O
it O

Third O
, O
the O
fans O
run O
very O
quietly O
, O
considering O
they O
are O
not O
inside O

like O
in O
other O
cool O

pads O
) O
, O
rendering O
noise O
a O
non O

issue O
. O

I O
've O
taken O
it O
out O
for O
long O
walks O
and O
find O
the O
bag O
to O
be O
very O
comfortable O
even O
when O
fully O
loaded O
. O

And O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
red O
rubbing O
off O

some O

With O
the O

on O
it O

about O

5 O
hours O
watching O

and O

This O
does O
exactly O
what O
it O
is O
meant O
to O
do O

Over O
time O
, O
this O
has O
gotten O
easier O
, O
but O
still O
not O
ideal.- O
Built O
into O
the O
large O
flap O
are O
two O
longer O

Other O
times O
, O
it O
is O
a O
little O
muffled O
, O
but O
works O
well O
enough O
( O
especially O
while O
driving O
) O
. O

Would O
definitely O
buy O
again O
. O

But O
, O
again O
... O
this O
was O
not O
a O
deciding O
factor O
for O
me O
; O
merely O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
inconvenience O
if O
I O
'm O
someplace O
where O
it O
is O
n't O
practical O
to O
use O
speakers O
. O

According O
to O
Google O
this O
is O
symptomatic O
of O
a O
defective O

I O
went O
to O

if O
I O
were O

the O

and O
the O

is O
less O

with O

but O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
? O

Problem O
solved O

I O
bought O
this O

to O
use O
with O
my O

Installed O
quickly O
into O
my O

to O

- O
recognizes O
all O
of O
it O
and O
seems O
to O
run O
perfecto O
with O
it O
. O

Great O
accessory O
and O
a O
must O
for O
your O
tf300 O
, O
that O
extra O
battery O
life O
is O
a O
life O
saver O
and O
good O
size O
keyboard O
that O
is O
very O
confortable O
and O
responsive O
. O

With O
or O
without O
the O
case O
, O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
stays O
snug O
inside O
the O
sleeve O
without O
much O
wiggle O
room O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
's O
a O
power O
cord O
there O
is O
only O
one O
thing O
that O
can O
go O
wrong O
how O
can O
they O
all O
be O
so O
bad O

This O

works O
great O
for O

with O

Its O
a O

carry O

3 O

everywhere O
, O
I O
just O
simply O
enjoy O
having O
this O

for O
a O

to O

I O
've O
ordered O
from O
them O
before O
just O
by O
happenstance O
, O
the O
randomness O
of O
Amazon O
suppliers O
. O

Therefore O
, O
a O
connector O
like O
this O
which O
has O
those O
extra O

works O
just O
fine O

I O
say O
this O
is O
your O

It O
simply O
does O
n't O
come O
close O
to O
this O
figure O

It O
works O
as O
advertised O
, O
very O
thick O
cable O
does O
not O
feel O
like O
it O
would O
break O
anytime O
soon O

and O
I O
never O
lose O

One O
of O
the O

broke O

The O
last O
item O
fits O
, O
but O
does O
stick O
out O
a O
little O
from O
the O
back O
. O

The O
8 O
- O
9 O
hour O
battery O
life O
they O
promote O
is O
only O
true O
if O
you O
have O
the O
display O
turned O
down O

and O
wireless O
turned O
off O

Since O
I O
'm O
an O
avid O
biker O
and O
frequent O
traveler O
, O
backpacks O
are O
a O
part O
of O
my O
everyday O
life O
. O

With O
some O
practice O
one O
can O
maneuver O
it O
quite O
well O
and O
the O
vast O
amount O
of O
choices O
I O
have O
is O
astronomical O
, O
all O
at O
my O
fingertips O
. O

My O
only O
gripe O
with O
the O
laptop O
is O
the O
operating O
system O
. O

and O
, O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
switch O
over O
to O
a O
conventional O
desktop O
. O

I O
can O
read O
email O
, O
thinking O
I O
will O
bide O
my O
time O
until O
the O
UPS O
driver O
crosses O
the O
Mississippi O
and O
make O
it O
out O
my O
way O
, O
and O
like O
Woah O
! O

My O
Wii O
could O
n't O
tell O
that O
an O
Ethernet O
cable O
was O
even O
connected O
with O
this O
adapter O
plugged O
into O
the O
USB O
port O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
carry O
this O
around O
and O
use O
it O
as O
a O
portable O
solution O
for O
traveling O
, O
it O
may O
not O
last O
very O
long O
. O

My O
only O
complaints O
were O
that O
the O

bit O
much O

the O

was O
a O
bit O

widely O

the O
chicklet O
or O
island O
style O
and O
are O
easy O
to O
use O
without O
messing O
up O
. O

Anyways O
, O
so O
I O
fought O
over O
and O
over O
and O
over O
, O
uninstalling O
, O
reinstalling O
, O
etc O
. O

You O
can O
tweak O
the O
contrast O
up O
from O
this O
point O
to O
give O
the O
image O
some O
snap O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
go O
too O
high O

and O
I O
could O
n't O
even O
control O
the O
arrow O
/ O
pointer O
. O

I O
do O
have O
to O
hit O
the O
button O
on O
the O
transmitter O
everytime O
I O
power O
on O
the O
headphones O
to O
reconnect O
, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
minor O
issue O
. O

The O
screen O
itself O
is O
excellent O
at O
what O
it O
is O
designed O
to O
do O
. O

It O
does O
not O
ask O
before O
installing O
. O

In O
box" O
... O
and O
listed O
some O
specs O
. O

So O
it O
should O
be O
a O
while O
before O
you O
have O
to O
go O
in O
for O
that O
battery O
replacement O
. O

I O
just O
keep O
him O
on O
the O
desk O
or O
next O
to O
whichever O
computer O
I O
am O
using O
him O
with O
, O
so O
he O
serves O
his O
purpose O
just O
as O
is O
, O
for O
me O
anyway O
. O

It O
took O
me O
months O
to O
find O
out O
it O
was O
the O
backpack O
that O
was O
RUINING O
my O
cotton O
shirts O
! O

but O
it O
has O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
steam O
and O
dampness O
of O
the O
shower O
. O

you O

Finally O

and O
price O

For O
that O

two O
giant O
floppy O

and O
64 O
K O
of O
RAM O
( O
and O
NO O

, O
my O
family O
paid O
almost O
five O
times O
what O
the O
Aspire O
One O
cost O
me O
in O
2008 O
. O

after O
you O
brick O
it O
and O
return O
it O
to O
Nokia O
, O
that O
's O
what O
you O
will O
end O
up O
with O

Oh O
, O
there O

also O

The O
new O
YouTube O
apps O
are O
not O
supported O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
even O
download O
them O
from O
the O
official O
marketplace O
because O
they O
require O
greater O
screen O
resolution O
. O

Calling O
or O
asking O
Dell O
will O
result O
in O
them O
blaming O
the O
battery O
and/or O
power O
board O
inside O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
purchasing O
more O
of O
these O
enclosures O
as O
needed O
. O

so O
it O
cools O
better O
, O
which O
is O
a O
big O
problem O
w O
/ O
these O
17 O
" O
screen O
models O
. O

Additionally O
there O
's O
another O
lightly O
cushioned O
zippered O
back O
compartment O
that O
has O
a O
pocked O
for O
an O
ipad O
sized O
device O
which O
I O
use O
all O
the O
time O
for O
my O
ipad O
. O

I O
used O
a O
cardboard O
cutout O
in O
the O
same O
shape O
as O
the O
top O
plate O
( O
elongated O
semicircle O
) O
to O
keep O
that O
part O
from O
touching O
the O
desk O
directly O
. O

The O
case O
is O
soft O
leather O
and O
feels O
secure O
, O
not O
hard O
and O
slippery O
in O
the O
hand O
. O

-Stand O
only O
tilts O

it O
's O
all O
the O
little O
things O
that O
make O
a O
great O
product O
. O

It O
is O
one O
of O
those O
items O
that O
either O
you O
need O
and O
find O
very O
useful O
... O
or O
... O
you O
do O
n't O
really O
need O
and O
it O
will O
just O
collect O
dust O
. O

if O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
another O
one O
, O
I O
suppose O
two O
would O
be O
louder O
than O
one O
. O

The O
arrow O
keys O
are O
larger O
on O
this O
laptop O
which O
is O
also O
a O
big O
plus O
in O
the O
gaming O
world O
. O

The O
spacebar O
requires O
a O
very O
hard O
push O
to O
make O
it O
work O
, O
therefore O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
type O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
to O
turn O
me O
off O
when O
you O
're O
done O
! O
" O
, O
but O
the O
power O
switch O
is O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
subwoofer O
, O
so O
let O
's O
face O
it O

I O
prefer O
this O
retina O
's O
build O
quality O
over O
the O
older O
macbook O
pros O
and O
airs O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
ANY O
sound O
. O

Also O
, O
you O
can O
stretch O
the O
number O
of O
plugs O
with O
these O
by O
bringing O
a O
small O
power O
strip O
with O
you O
to O
provide O
multiple O
American O
- O
style O
outlets O
off O
of O
one O
of O
these O
converters O
. O

The O
router O
was O
located O
just O
upstairs O
from O
the O
WNDA3100 O

It O
's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
do O
work O
on O
this O
thing O
, O
and O
when O
docked O
you O
can O
get O
the O
added O
boost O
of O
the O
Radeon O
HD O
GPU O
to O
really O
add O
some O
zing O
. O

Tried O
it O
with O
an O
HP O
as O
well O
as O
Compaq O
, O
and O
both O
both O
worked O
great O
. O

Oh O
well O
. O

After O
much O
research O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
recently O
from O
my O
local O
military O
exchange O
to O
replace O
an O
older O
( O
and O
getting O
flaky O
) O
54AG O
router O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
15 O
inch O
HP O
laptop O
because O
the O
computer O
runs O
a O
bit O
hot O
. O

Most O
laptop O
users O
, O
no O
matter O
which O
hand O
they O
use O
, O
are O
used O
to O
clicking O
below O
a O
touch O
pad O
. O

It O
has O
good O
protection O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage O
space O
. O

It O
's O
true O
that O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

It O
evened O
out O
and O
did O
n't O
reappear O
, O
but O
it O
made O
me O
hesitate O
to O
give O
it O
a O
full O
five O
stars O
. O

it O
's O
uncomfortable O
when O
she O
has O
laptop O
on O
her O
legs O
. O

I O
have O
a O
working O
external O
firewire O
800 O
sata O
drive O
enclosure O
that O
works O
great O
with O
a O
hard O
drive O
. O

that O
's O
out O
there O
for O
less O
than O
a O
cheeseburger O
combo O
meal O
. O

The O
keyboard O
has O
a O
glossy O
black O
top O
body O
, O
textured O
black O
keys O
and O
the O
liner O
below O
the O
keys O
is O
a O
red O
- O
orange O
. O

and O
it O
was O
free O
shipping O
so O
that O
is O
always O
a O
plus O
! O

My O
hands O
do O
n't O
feel O
cramped O
typing O
on O
it.-Battery O
charged O
quickly O
and O
has O
held O
it O
's O

Do O
not O
worry O
about O
volume O
levels O
it O
easily O
fills O
up O
a O
room O
, O
do O
not O
expect O
it O
to O
fill O
up O
a O
house O
.. O

The O
Leopard O
OS O
is O
way O
better O
than O
Vista O
. O

OK O
, O
so O
now O
I O
'm O
thinking O
I O
'll O
just O
temporarily O
move O
my O
leather O
recliner O
closer O
to O
the O
60&#34 O
; O

I O
play O
my O
iPhone O
on O
the O
speaker O
when O
I O
m O
taking O
a O
shower O
. O

One O
last O
thing O
, O
though O
Dell O
's O
customer O
service O
does O
take O
longer O
time O
than O
average O
, O
I O
HIGHLY O
recommend O
buying O
a O
hardware O
warranty O
, O
I O
needed O
it O
in O
the O
past O
and O
it O
paid O
out O
well O
, O
in O
fact O
my O
former O
Dell O
Adamo O
was O
a O
replacement O
for O
an O
older O
model O
that O
Dell O
simply O
offered O
to O
send O
instead O
of O
repairing O
the O
older O
one O
, O
how O
cool O
was O
that O
? O
! O

Without O
it O
, O
I O
can O
still O
barely O
get O
the O
netbook O
into O
the O
sleeve O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
noticeably O
slower O
if O
my O
battery O
is O
charging O
or O
if O
I O
just O
use O
the O
charger O
( O
without O
my O
battery O
) O
. O

Just O
wish O
I O
had O
n't O
wasted O
so O
many O
hours O
on O
it O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
many O
adapters O
for O
international O
travel O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
. O

so O
I O
did O
some O
research O
, O
checked O
out O
buyer O
ratings O
before O
ordering O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
! O

This O
is O
not O
the O
case O
with O
touch O
screen O
. O

It O
connected O
to O
my O
MBP O
instantly O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
having O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
cooler O
fan O

I O
was O
going O
to O
return O
the O
item O
, O
becuase O
another O
fan O
did O
nt O
really O
work O
as O
good O
as O
the O
others O
, O
but O
well O
, O
after O
2 O
days O
that O
fan O
is O
working O
great O
, O
and O
the O
noise O
is O
gone O
, O
maybe O
it O
just O
needed O
to O
be O
used O
a O
bit O
. O

I O
love O
that O
it O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
instant O
seat O
at O
the O
boarding O
area O
when O
there O
are O
no O
seats O
available O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
( O
and O
I O
'll O
just O
assume O
the O
original O
lockup O
problem O
was O
just O
a O
fluke O
) O

I O
have O
a O
HP O
G62 O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
fitting O
, O
mine O
fit O
perfectly O
. O

Do O
n't O
know O
why O
so O
many O
top O
end O
computers O
and O
laptops O
have O
separate O
mic O
and O
speaker O
adapters O
and O
so O
many O
great O
headsets O
hae O
one O
single O
combined O
adapter O
? O

Although O
you O
would O
get O
a O
nice O
performance O
boost O
if O
you O
turn O
off O
all O
the O
startup O
daemons O
, O
I O
only O
kept O
on O
3 O
out O
of O
more O
then O
a O
dozen O
or O
so O
. O

I O
am O
completely O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

It O
was O
the O
only O
hard O
side O
case O
that O
was O
solid O
around O
the O
edges O
only O
, O
allowing O
flexibility O
to O
expand O
for O
the O
power O
supply O
and O
a O
mouse O
in O
the O
outer O
pocket O
. O

I O
have O
to O
admit O
I O
judged O
the O
product O
before O
even O
using O
it O
like O
judging O
a O
book O
by O
its O
cover O
. O

It O
can O
also O
hold O
a O
cell O
phone O
or O
small O
notebook O
like O
a O
steno O
pad O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
netbook O
, O
but O
not O
much O
else O
. O

The O
procedure O
for O
charging O
the O
battery O
when O
it O
is O
totally O
dead O
was O
not O
what O
I O
expected O
. O

It O
seems O
OK O
now O
but O
makes O
me O
very O
nervous O
. O

My O
initial O
thoughts O
were O
I O
could O
swap O
out O
the O
fans O
if O
they O
died O
and O
I O
generally O
like O
cooler O
master O
products O
. O

I O
typically O
mess O
with O
that O
for O
about O
3 O
or O
4 O
mins O
to O
get O
it O
perfect O
. O

Setup O
is O
not O
difficult O
and O
I O
have O
only O
had O
to O
change O
the O
channel O
once O
to O
keep O
the O
neighbors O
from O
interfering O
with O
my O
signal O
. O

However O
, O
when O
I O
came O
back O
to O
use O
it O
again O
it O
refused O
to O
re O
- O
pair O
with O
any O
of O
my O
devices O
and O
just O
appeared O
dead O
. O

The O
price O
is O
pretty O
reasonable O
for O
an O
entry O
level O
tablet O
from O
a O
reputable O
brand O
like O
Wacom O
. O

No O
cons O
, O
this O
is O
a O
fantastic O
cable O
. O

However O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
you O
can O
fit O
a O
battery O
charger O
and O
other O
items O
as O
well O
if O
you O
own O
a O
13 O
. O
3 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

We O
were O
considering O
buying O
a O
new O
one O

All O
your O
little O
car O
chargers O
, O
for O
cell O
phones O
and O
other O
low O
amp O
draw O
goodies O
are O
now O
good O
to O
use O
indoors O
. O

But O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
is O
n't O
sturdy O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
and O
the O
two O
year O
extension O
on O
the O
warranty O
was O
very O
reasonable O
from O
ACER O
at O
$ O
75 O
. O

I O
had O
bought O
some O
similar O
items O
on O
eBay O
for O
my O
nephew O
's O
Compaq O
laptop O
and O
they O
had O
not O
worked O
. O

" O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
the O
picture O
on O
this O
thing O
" O
. O

: O
This O
is O
purely O
for O
display O
, O
I O
have O
not O
tried O
the O
monitor O
's O
audio O
or O
webcam O
functions O
as O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
them O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
can O
sell O
off O
my O
Mac O
mini O
and O
put O
some O
extra O
cash O
in O
my O
pocket O
, O
all O
thanks O
to O
the O
BookArc O
! O

For O
the O
small O
size O
, O
they O
put O
out O
great O
sound O
and O
you O
can O
really O
crank O
them O
up O
if O
you O
want O
to O
. O

I O
have O
handled O
many O
power O
supplies O
but O
i O
have O
n't O
seen O
any O
that O
are O
as O
high O
quality O
as O
this O
unit O
. O

Time O
for O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
using O
this O
sleeve O
for O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
, O
it O
looks O
to O
me O
like O
you O
could O
fit O
three O
Macbook O
Airs O
stacked O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
inside O
this O
case O
. O

AND O
.. O
they O
love O
it O
for O
their O
games O
. O

It O
still O
works O
really O
great O
, O
by O
pushing O
air O
down O
and O
a O
bit O
to O
the O
left O
right O
towards O
my O
laptop O
's O
intake O
fan O
! O

I O
looked O
at O
all O
the O
different O
angles O
of O
many O
similar O
products O
and O
I O
wanted O
something O
that O
would O
stand O
without O
the O
likeliness O
of O
toppling O
forward O
( O
screen O
side O
down O
-just O
like O
jelly O
on O
toast O
would O
) O

The O
forward O
button O
is O
the O
easiest O
to O
reach O
when O
mousing O

MSI O
delivers O
here O
as O
well O
with O
one O
minor O
issue O
... O

I O
use O
this O
amplifier O
for O
the O
headphone O
output O
of O
my O
digital O
SLR O
. O

It O
does O
work O
well O
for O
keeping O
the O
cords O
organizes O
( O
especially O
the O
AC O
power O
cord O
) O
. O

They O
fit O
fine O
in O
my O
luggage O
, O
but O
not O
in O
my O
laptop O
bag O
, O
and O
I O
still O
have O
to O
carry O
chargers O
for O
my O
cell O
phone O
, O
phone O
earpiece O
, O
and O
iPod O
. O

I O
need O
to O
access O
a O
server O
for O
work O

This O
is O
a O
great O
set O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
as O
good O
as O
any O
I'v O
had O
. O

I O
found O
a O
video O
on O
YouTube O
that O
showed O
me O
how O
to O
take O
the O
old O
keyboard O
out O
. O

5ghz O
sounds O
low O
, O
but O
4 O
cores O
in O
a O
general O
purpose O
Windows O
environment O
has O
been O
working O
very O
well O
for O
me O
. O

I O
am O
now O
pursuing O
two O
venues O
to O
get O
a O
refund O
: O
through O
Amazon O
and O
through O
my O
credit O
card O
company O
's O
purchase O
policy O
. O

To O
some O
, O
this O
may O
not O
be O
an O
issue O
, O
but O
to O
me O
, O
I O
like O
to O
have O
a O
firm O
connection O
. O

I O
was O
told O
that O
this O
was O
easy O
and O
that O
the O
Mac O
would O
have O
no O
problem O
doing O
so O
. O

Laptop O
batteries O
are O
expensive O
, O
expecially O
for O
some O
older O
laptops O
. O

best O
that O
I O
could O
find O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Cyberlink O
PowerDirector O
8 O
will O
not O
run O
on O
my O
netbook O
due O
to O
minimum O
screen O
resolution O
. O

I O
had O
a O
little O
issue O
getting O
the O
battery O
to O
fit O
into O
my O
dv2000 O
, O
but O
it O
works O
great O
. O

This O
laptop O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
problem O
. O

If O
I O
were O
moving O
the O
PC O
long O
distances O
or O
frequently O
, O
I O
would O
not O
find O
this O
a O
good O
solution O
. O

Everything O
was O
intact O
and O
the O
packages O
were O
complete O
and O
not O
damaged O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
was O
delivered O
today O
and O
the O
red O
is O
just O
a O
hint O
and O
hardly O
noticeable O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
cost O
if O
you O
want O
accurate O
color O
. O

There O
are O
additional O
features O
that O
it O
has O
that O
I O
have O
not O
figured O
out O
from O
the O
instructions O
this O
may O
be O
a O
negative O
however O
in O
my O
case O
I O
do O
not O
need O
them O
. O

I O
'm O
counting O
the O
ram O
as O
a O
mandatory O
upgrade O
if O
you O
want O
to O
avoid O
a O
sluggish O
user O
experience O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

It O
's O
well O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
the O
laptop O
is O
very O
tempting O
for O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
remote O
is O
just O
beautiful O
, O
you O
can O
even O
turn O
you O
computer O
on O
with O
it O
. O

You O
would O
not O
want O
the O
tag O
outside O
for O
privacy O
reasons O
. O

I O
bought O
one O
Sony O
Vaio O
VGN O
- O
CS115D O
on O
OCT O
2008 O
and O
after O
four O
months O
of O
use O
it O
started O
to O
make O
a O
noise O
that O
became O
worst O
and O
worst O
. O

58 O
mm O
center O
pinch O
lens O
caps O
work O
great O
, O
even O
when O
I O
have O
my O
lens O
hood O
attached O
. O

It O
only O
has O
one O
zipper O
on O
the O
top O
for O
your O
laptop O
, O
one O
in O
the O
back O
and O
two O
in O
the O
front O
. O

Do O
n't O
try O
to O
save O
money O
on O
this O
item O
. O

No O
problem O
with O
the O
eller O
, O
just O
a O
cheal O
device O
. O

The O
arrow O
keys O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bit O
bigger O
as O
there O
is O
room O
along O
the O
lower O
right O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard O
. O

It O
is O
sturdy O
and O
can O
handle O
as O
much O
as O
you O
want O
to O
shove O
in O
it O
. O

, O
after O
re O
- O
booting O
, O
the O
adapter O
automatically O
found O
the O
correct O
driver O
in O
Network O
Preferences O
. O

PERFECT O
FOR O
THE O
PROTECTION O
I O
NEEDED O
, O
IT O
IS O
WHAT O
I O
WAS O
LOOKING O
FOR O
, O

Had O
to O
get O
a O
new O
case O
for O
it O
to O
handle O
the O
width2 O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
keep O
track O
of O
it O
. O

Very O
good O
product O
. O

you O
're O
like O
me O
and O
do O
n't O
use O
cd O
drives O
( O
thanks O
to O
imac O
and O
macbook O
air O
) O
, O
finding O
the O
driver O
online O
was O
a O
chore O
. O

Ca O
n't O
press O
both O
at O
once O
as O
it O
pivots O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
using O
it O
with O
your O
computer O
, O
just O
plug O
its O
power O
cord O
into O
any O
available O
USB O
port O
and O
it O
will O
keep O
the O
battery O
charged O
. O

Great O
service O

The O
Ivy O
Bridge O
Intel O
Core O
i5 O
dual O
- O
core O
processor O
is O
blazing O
fast O
. O

I O
tried O
that O
one O
first O
at O
twice O
the O
price O
and O
after O
working O
with O
the O
tech O
support O
from O
Toshiba O

The O
product O
does O
not O
come O
with O
all O
the O
information O
needed O
for O
plug O
and O
play O
. O

Focusing O

" O
substantial".The O
Samsung O

is O
also O
physically O
very O
svelte O
. O

Installation O
was O
a O
breeze O
and O
loading O
the O
operating O
system O
was O
easy O
. O

I O
adjusted O
the O
bag O
so O
it O
rides O
on O
my O
waist O
. O

It O
works O
great O
with O
headphones O
, O
but O
the O
speakers O
sound O
is O
very O
weak O
& O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
bottom O
of O
this O
thing O
, O
so O
when O
you O
set O
it O
down O
it O
muffles O
the O
sound O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
GPS O
system O
because O
of O
two O
reasons O
- O
it O
had O
the O
largest O
LCD O
screen O
for O
its O
price O
range O
on O
the O
market O
today O
, O
and O
because O
of O
all O
the O
5-star O
ratings O
on O
Amazon O
. O

Front O
zippered O
compartment O
is O
nice O
size O
for O
holding O
your O
charger O
. O

There O
's O
dozens O
of O
settings O
you O
can O
tweak O
with O
this O
set O

Most O
were O
able O
to O
peel O
and O
re O
- O
stick O
theirs O
for O
5 O
days O
. O

Two O
words O
, O
buy O
one O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
able O
either O
to O
complete O
the O
installation O
. O

Update O
5/25/14This O
keyboard O
is O
still O
working O
and O
has O
been O
passed O
off O
through O
4 O
computers O
with O
no O
trouble O
. O

The O
guard O
will O
quickly O
deform O
to O
interfere O
with O
fan O
operation O
, O
leading O
to O
heating O
of O
the O
fan O
motor O
, O
heating O
the O
air O
which O
is O
subsequently O
blown O
in O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

Then O
I O
connect O
the O
vga O
cable O
and O
auxiliary O
cable O
and O
I O
'm O
in O
business O
. O

The O
seams O
appear O
to O
be O
very O
well O
made O
, O
with O
no O
sloppy O
stitching O
or O
rough O
edges O
. O

perhaps O
that O
is O
why O
I O
am O
so O
harsh O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
MacBook O
air O
is O
whole O
lot O
better O
than O
many O
other O
laptops O
I O
've O
seen O
or O
used O
. O

it O
should O
definitely O
fit O
any O
size O
laptop O
you O
have O
and O
pockets O
for O
all O
your O
add O
ons O
and O
gadgets O
. O

The O
battery O
needed O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
simple O
modification O
with O
a O
Dremel O
to O
get O
it O
to O
fit O
the O
UV-5RA O

It O
failed O
during O
my O
first O
use O
. O

Saw O
this O
product O
on O
a O
tech O
show O
and O
was O
immediately O
intrigued O
by O
it O
. O

Great O
price O
too O
. O

Three O
hundred O
for O
.4 O
ghz O
, O
backlit O
keyboard O
and O
a O
250 O
gb O
hard O
drive O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
for O
me O
. O

It O
never O
fails O
to O
get O
a O
comment O
" O
like O
your O
case O
" O
from O
the O
geniuses O
at O
the O
Apple O
Bar O
. O

These O
are O
just O
a O
tiny O
bit O
stiffer O
material O
, O
but O
still O
great O
to O
use O
. O

The O
other O
is O
where O
you O
'd O
keep O
your O
other O
stuff O
. O

One O
caveat O
. O

These O
cards O
get O
such O
low O
ratings O
sometimes O
due O
to O
incompatibility O
but O
typically O
due O
to O
user O
error O
. O

Probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
bag O
to O
date O
! O

While O
viewing O
System O
Profiler O
> O
Power O
, O
the O
battery O
already O
had O
2 O
previous O
charge O
cycles O
, O
and O
was O
accepting O
a O
charge O
from O
my O
Macbook O
. O

It O
is O
just O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
migrate O
it O
around O
the O
house O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
still O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
full O
- O
sized O
number O
pad O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
reason O
not O
to O
buy O
this O
model O
. O

Just O
download O
the O
drivers O
from O
the O
Internet O
. O

These O
are O
great O
speakers O
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
prefer O
the O
USB O
adaptor O
to O
laptop O
card O
because O
laptop O
wireless O
cards O
can O
easily O
get O
knocked O
or O
damaged O
as O
they O
stick O
out O
the O
side O
of O
the O
machine O
( O
problem O
if O
you O
travel O
regularly O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
running O
a O
1900x1200 O
monitor O
on O
it O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
camera O
for O
the O
price O
. O

These O
guys O
shipped O
it O
by O
Priority O
Mail O

good O
buy O
happy O
customer O
. O

The O
picture O
is O
exquisite O
, O
and O
far O
outpaces O
the O
three O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Sony O
VEGA O
set O
it O
replaced O
( O
the O
old O
set O
only O
did O
720p O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
... O

The O
computer O
I O
have O
with O
Windows O
XP O
on O
it O
is O
obviously O
an O
older O
computer O
from O
2005 O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
inspired O
the O
designer O
to O
put O
the O
speaker O
/ O
earphone O
jack O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
front O
edge O
, O
instead O
of O
on O
the O
side O
or O
the O
back O
, O
but O
that O
's O
about O
my O
only O
gripe O
. O

I O
ordered O
from O
Amazon O

The O
bass O
could O
be O
a O
little O
deeper O
but O
for O
the O
price O
they O
sound O
good O
; O
that O
's O
not O
really O
a O
complaint O
. O

Save O
some O
money O
by O
ordering O
this O
from O
Amazon O
. O

All O
had O
frustrating O
" O
jumpy O
, O
unpredictable O
cursor O
" O
too O
often O
. O

I O
love O
my O
Mac O

The O
1 O
problem O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
earlier O
. O

It O
lasts O
about O
2 O
hours O
with O
regular O
use O
on O
battery O
. O

All O
my O
apps O
, O
contacts O
, O
calendar O
and O
browsing O
tabs O
were O
there O
, O
just O
like O
on O
my O
old O
Chromebook O
. O

I O
am O
a O
Asus O
net O
book O
freak O
! O

If O
you O
want O
GPS O
on O
a O
wifi O
only O
iPad O
I O
would O
suggest O
this O
add O
on O
. O

If O
you O
think O
this O
wo O
n't O
be O
a O
problem O
for O
you O
then O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
mouse O
to O
pick O
up O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
dental O
bill O
, O
and O
my O
teeth O
are O
clean!!I O

My O
old O
laptop O
's O
power O
adapter O
had O
a O
right O
angle O
, O
where O
this O
one O
is O
straight O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
weigh O
a O
little O
less O
than O
the O
OEM O
battery O
. O

Unlike O
every O
other O
headphones O
/ O
earbuds O
I O
own O
, O
this O
one O
is O
made O
of O
braided O
nylon O
. O

it O
actually O
opens O
like O
its O
supposed O
toI O
have O
been O
using O
pcs O
all O
my O
life O

I O
was O
taken O
in O
by O
the O
low O
price O
of O
this O
item O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
I O
'm O
getting O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
. O

I O
gave O
this O
to O
my O
sister O
for O
her O
birthday O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
n't O
even O
good O
. O

Others O
have O
commented O
on O
how O
short O
and O
stiff O
the O
cable O
is O
that O
comes O
with O
this O
, O
so O
I O
wo O
n't O
belabor O
the O
point O
much O
further O
except O
to O
point O
out O
something O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
mentioned O
on O
here O
before O

Just O
know O
that O
it O
is O
of O
lower O
quality O
than O
original O
. O

The O
speakers O
for O
my O
laptop O
, O
well O
lets O
just O
say O
they O
are O
less O
than O
stellar O
. O

Got O
mine O
for O
$ O
1749 O
( O
after O
rebates O
-- O
no O
tax O
or O
shipping O
) O
from O
Amazon O
. O

What O
the O
heck O
happened O
to O
Dell O
they O
use O
to O
be O
a O
good O
company O
but O
now O
they O
are O
terrible O

5-inch O
speakers O
, O
but O
poor O
otherwise O
. O

The O
current O
version O
is O
1 O
. O
01-Build O
7 O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
downloaded O
. O

and O
I O
and O
both O
bags O
are O
very O
durable O
and O
have O
held O
up O
very O
well O
. O

There O
is O
one O
very O
small O
pocket O
in O
the O
front O
that O
is O
too O
small O
for O
most O
things O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
small O
pocket O
a O
top O
, O
where O
you O
could O
drop O
in O
your O
phone O
/ O
ipod O
/ O
etc O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
necessarily O
recommend O
doing O
it O
on O
your O
own O
if O
you O
are O
completely O
computer O
illiterate O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
basic O
understanding O
of O
how O
to O
work O
on O
a O
computer O
it O
was O
n't O
so O
bad O
. O

Great O
battery O
life O
. O

This O
has O
not O
happened O
everytime O
but O
it O
is O
annoying O
so O
before O
plugging O
into O
AC O
, O
I O
manually O
set O
the O
performace O
by O
pushing O
the O
left O
side O
power O
button O
and O
put O
it O
in O
Power O
Save O
mode O
. O

It O
's O
great O
for O
normal O
use O
, O
and O
excels O
for O
gaming O
use O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
it O
lasts O
because O
I O
want O
to O
use O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
instructions O
there O
are O
simple O
enough O
, O
make O
more O
sense O
, O
and O
generally O
produce O
the O
right O
result O
. O

Figured O
we O
should O
just O
go O
with O
the O
one O
we O
had O
that O
was O
already O
working O
great O
. O

Install O
was O
easy O
, O
the O
software O
was O
well O
designed O
, O
and O
the O
speeds O
are O
great O
! O

This O
will O
not O
replace O
my O
Lenovo O
laptop O
for O
business O
travel O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
perfect O
for O
pleasure O
travel O
and O
just O
around O
the O
house O
when O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
on O
my O
desktop O
and O
pull O
out O
my O
laptop O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
bothered O
by O
the O
Canon O
name O
on O
the O
back O
of O
this O
bag O
, O
it O
works O
great O
for O
any O
brand O
of O
camera O
you O
may O
have O
. O

One O
of O
the O
greatest O
inventions O
ever O
made O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
've O
been O
using O
the O
company O
HVX200 O

all O
I O
have O
to O
do O
is O
turn O
off O
the O
headsets O
to O
disconnect O
bluetooth O
link O
and O
turn O
it O
back O
on O
to O
establish O
it O
. O

For O
the O
record O
, O
I O
've O
ordered O
inexpensive O
chargers O
like O
this O
for O
Dell O
laptops O
probably O
8 O
times O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
. O

You O
can O
generally O
get O

you O
do O
light O
web O
browsing O
( O
especially O
with O

as O
it O
is O
built O
by O

) O
. O

Upgrading O
to O
this O
replacement O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
an O
excellent O
decision O

It O
doesn&#8217;t O

EXCEEDS O

am O
passing O
on O
these O
words O
of O
wisdom O
onto O
other O
people O
who O
are O
considering O
purchasing O
this O
lock O
for O
their O
laptop O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
as O
an O
extra O
for O
the O
2 O
hp O
laptops O
I O
own O
. O

The O
Patriot O
Fuel+ O
comes O
in O
several O
different O
capacities O
. O

Old O
battery O
is O
detected O
fine O
after O
installing O
while O
already O
booted O
into O
Windows O
. O

27 O
Inch O
LED O
lit O
Professional O
Graphicsand O
another O
Acer O
one O
with O
1920x1200 O
. O

I O
ordered O
5 O
of O
these O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
myself O
since O
we O
had O
a O
few O
cables O
break O
in O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
. O

It O
's O
small O
, O
lightweight O
, O
holds O
a O
charge O

Ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
the O
value O
of O
the O
warranty O
as O
I O
have O
not O
used O
it O
... O
and O
I O
am O
a O
VERY O
heavy O
usenet O
user O
- O
frequently O
downloading O
24x7 O
several O
days O
per O
week O
! O

It O
's O
certainly O
a O
nicer O
one O
- O
panel O
solution O
than O
Windows O
8 O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
connect O
my O
old O
fan O
, O
so O
with O
three O
fans O
at O
work O
, O
my O
laptop O
receives O
pretty O
good O
air O
flow O
on O
its O
underside O
, O
something O
that O
can O
be O
really O
important O
, O
when O
your O
computer O
is O
n't O
located O
in O
an O
air O
conditioned O
space O
. O

after O
this O
tv O
is O
3d O
tv O
. O

But O
so O
far O
four O
different O
server O
drives O
with O
varying O
file O
systems O
and O

After O
I O
bought O
it O
I O
discovered O
that O
it O
has O
serious O
flaws O
. O

As O
for O
sound O
staying O
in O
sync O
, O
I O
so O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
have O
since O
returned O
it O
and O
am O
now O
considering O
an O
Alienware O
14 O
. O

The O
highly O
configurable O
Synaptics O
touchpad O
works O
well O
and O
the O
glass O
surface O
is O
smooth O
to O
the O
touch O
. O

There O
are O
2 O
USB O
ports O
that O
are O
accessible O
via O
a O
piece O
that O
flaps O
open O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
magnet O
- O
like O
piece O
, O
so O
be O
ready O
to O
use O
your O
nails O
to O
pull O
it O
out O
. O

This O
is O
absolutely O
correct O
. O

Laptop O
's O
LCD O
does O
n't O
work O
in O
this O
setup O
. O

I O
have O
found O
this O
to O
be O
a O
great O
bag O
to O
carry O
every O
day O
, O
even O
when O
I O
've O
loaded O
it O
beyond O
it O
's O
capacity O
. O

A O
bag O
that O
could O
carry O
and O
protect O
the O
majority O
of O
my O
lenses O
and O
my O
laptop O
computer O
. O

Some O
people O
on O
here O
have O
raved O
about O
the O
colors O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
just O
the O
same O
as O
my O
Samsung O
's O
, O
which O
are O
truly O
great O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

Again O
, O
it O
works O
vastly O
better O
than O
the O
multi O
- O
touch O
pad O
in O
my O
newest O
Dell O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
as O
the O
last O
option O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
cash O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
buying O

The O
storage O
compartment O
is O
great O
for O
things O
like O
pens O
, O
computer O
disks O
, O
memory O
cards O
, O
simple O
earbuds O
or O
a O
* O
small O
* O
mouse O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
large O
enough O
for O
a O
regular O
mouse O
, O
the O
laptop O
's O
power O
cord O
or O
a O
headset O
with O
mic O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
should O
have O
looked O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
cross O
my O
mind O
that O
in O
these O
days O
when O
everything O
switches O
from O
110 O
to O
220 O
automatically O
that O
a O
" O
travel O
" O
surge O
protector O
would O
only O
work O
on O
110 O
volts O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
this O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
different O
offering O
-- O
being O
entirely O
more O
specific O
in O
its O
use O
-- O
and O
has O
some O
real O
strengths O
despite O
not O
being O
my O
ideal O
camera O
bag O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
K340 O
to O
keep O
in O
the O
living O
room O
to O
use O
with O
my O
integrated O
PC O
/ O
TV O
system O
. O

The O
color O
is O
a O
little O
off O
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
it O
will O
be O
perfect O
with O
windows O
7 O
, O
but O
not O
everything O
is O
as O
we O
like O
and O
this O
one O
comes O
with O
Windows O
8 O
( O
not O
good O
) O
. O

It O
fits O
fine O
, O
and O
the O
color O
is O
great O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
other O
aspects O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
glad O
that O
this O
cord O
was O
available O
. O

I O
figured O
I O
could O
just O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
magically O
it O
would O
record O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
and O
use O
. O

Well O
, O
with O
it O
's O
USB O

Makes O
my O
old O
IBM O
Thinkpad O
like O
new O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
sleeve O
. O

I O
considered O
full O
over O
- O
ear O
headphones O

I O
literally O
held O
the O
laptop O
right O
next O
to O
my O
AP O
and O
this O
thing O
still O
could O
n't O
detect O
it O
. O

the O
usb O
is O
only O
available O
if O
it O
is O
not O
charging O
a O
battery O
. O

I O
love O
these O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O

Cocoon O
has O
some O
wonderful O
products O
and O
this O
is O
another O
of O
them O
. O

This O
feature O
really O
helps O
turn O
this O
machine O
into O
a O
desktop O
workstation O
replacement O
. O

This O
is O
a O
GREAT O
little O
computer O
that O
has O
been O
totally O
cleaned O
up O
and O
reloaded O
with O
late O
generation O
OX O
software O
. O

In O
the O
past O
I O
have O
had O
Good O
luck O
fixing O
these O
problems O
... O

After O
two O
initial O
clicks O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
you O
need O
to O
click O
the O
buttons O
on O
the O
slanted O
angle O
, O
piece O
of O
cake O
. O

so O
I O
just O
purchased O
another O
one O
. O

Would O
recommend O
as O
a O
good O
OEM O
replacement O
. O

Shipping O
was O
fast O
, O
too O
! O

While O
it O
is O
easily O
stained O
with O
fingerprints O
, O
I O
love O
the O
way O
the O
shell O
feels O
. O

The O
cloths O
were O
exactly O
as O
described O
and O
exactly O
as O
delivered O
in O
the O
first O
order O
. O

You O
need O
to O
let O
the O
battery O
charge O
up O
first O
, O
then O
completely O
discharge O
down O
to O
nothing O
then O
recharge O
it O
to O
get O
the O
full O
9 O
hours O
out O
of O
it O
. O

There O
is O
no O
volume O
control O
. O

I O
have O
returned O
the O
item O
to O
the O
seller O
for O
a O
refund O
. O

Cheap O
, O
easy O
and O
made O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
the O
default O
one O
that O
ships O
with O
the O
HP O
. O

GPU O
handling O
and O
switching O
is O
reliant O
on O
the O
driver.- O
This O
laptop O
can O
do O
Dual O
Graphics O
under O
Windows O
( O
Vista+ O
) O
only O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
with O
Windows O
XP O
. O

Instead O
I O
find O
out O
the O
only O
way O
to O
contact O
support O
is O
through O
email O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
features O
of O
the O
pack O
are O
concerned O
, O
there O
are O
several O
other O
handy O
pouches O
for O
carrying O
your O
phone O
and O
laptop O
peripherals O
. O

The O
Kensington O
battery O
Amazon O
is O
selling O
is O
model O
K33396US O
. O

In O
the O
trash O
it O
goes O
. O

At O
this O
price O
point O
, O
if O
something O
breaks O
I O
'll O
buy O
another O
one O
just O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
say O
that O
lightly O
. O

Also O
the O
usuable O
space O
on O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
675 O
GB O
. O

No O
problems O
with O
this O
PSU O
, O
i O
got O
the O
850w O
version O
, O
looks O
great O
in O
my O
case O
, O
love O
that O
its O
modular O
. O

It O
works O
very O
well O
on O
Vista O
SP2 O
32 O
bit O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
alright O
, O
but O
considering O
how O
inexpensive O
this O
unit O
is O
, O
you O
should O
n't O
be O
expecting O
Dolby O
Digital O
precision O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
. O

I O
got O
one O
from O
Ross O
and O
it O
was O
$ O
8 O
. O

After O
two O
hours O
of O
charging O
, O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
and O
nearly O
burned O
my O
hand O
. O

Although O
, O
I O
will O
say O
that O
after O
trying O
this O
phone O
, O
the O
Motorola O
Q O
and O
having O
a O
pretty O
good O
hands O
- O
on O
with O
the O
Blackjack O
and O
the O
Treo O
680 O
... O
this O
is O
the O
one O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
stick O
with O
. O

When O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
an O
old O
laptop O
needed O
more O
memory O
I O
searched O
the O
standard O
" O
big O
name O
" O
memory O
sites O
for O
modules O
. O

But O
at O
least O
it O
's O
a O
choice O
and O
not O
a O
slam O
dunk O
for O
Apple O
. O

There O
were O
some O
minor O
features O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
. O

I O
'm O
ok O
with O
that O
for O
the O
price O
I O
guess O
. O

These O
are O
great O
for O
moving O
music O
around O
and O
sharing O
pictures O
with O
friends O
. O

I O
now O
have O
an O
excellent O
connection O
to O
my O
router O
via O
5GHz O
, O
even O
though O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
distance O
that O
Wireless O
- O
G O
has O
( O
was O
n't O
really O
suppose O
to O
though O
) O
, O
with O
no O
protruding O
objects O
that O
can O
break O
off O
. O

My O
11 O
year O
own O
son O
loves O
the O
voices O
that O
you O
can O
download O
( O

Use O
Windows O
Media O
Center O
for O
most O
of O
my O
viewing O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
actually O
, O
I O
'd O
restarted O
the O
server O
and O
when O
it O
came O
back O
up O
, O
the O
camera O
resumed O
it O
's O
full O
functionality O
once O
again O
. O

It O
makes O
all O
my O
SanDisk O
SD O
cards O
come O
to O
life O
! O

I O
wanted O
this O
for O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
sound O
.... O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
get O
one O
. O

Charger O
works O
and O
is O
an O
okay O
substitute O
for O
the O
original O
. O

And O
as O
an O
added O
bonus O
, O
the O
charging O
cable O
is O
actually O
a O
USB O
cable O
, O
so O
can O
be O
used O
to O
connect O
to O
your O
computer O
. O

It O
works O
well O
for O
my O
ipod O
touch O
and O
it O
also O
charges O
the O
battery O
while O
in O
use- O

I O
plugged O
in O
my O
tablet O

So O
i O
decided O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
, O
because O
the O
ones O
i O
had O
b4 O
did O
nt O
do O
that O
, O
so O
thinking O
that O
it O
would O
be O
like O
my O
old O
adapters O
it O
should O
be O
at O
the O
right O
settings O
, O
but O
nope O
. O

While O
I O
was O
initially O
skeptical O
about O
Monster O
's O
unique O
approach O
with O
some O
of O
this O
adapter O
's O
features O
, O
I O
have O
grown O
to O
like O
it O
and O
it O
has O
now O
replaced O
my O
previous O
" O
favorite O
" O
adapter O
. O

Extra O
battery O
, O
USB O
port O
and O
a O
keyboard O
for O
when O
she O
needs O
to O
do O
serious O
work O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
the O
webcam O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
my O
full O
sized O
laptops O
, O
but O
it O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
my O
purposes O
. O

This O
one O
is O
as O
comfortable O
in O
warm O
weather O
as O
the O
best O
day O
- O
hiking O
pack O
I O
own O
. O

I O
would O
say O
there O
is O
about O
1/2&#34 O
; O
slack O
on O
each O
side O
. O

the O
polycarbonate O
would O
've O
shattered O
from O

I O
would O
recommend O
using O
a O
sleeve O
with O
the O

as O
the O
corners O
are O
exposed O
against O
the O

--I O
recently O
had O
to O
take O
a O
computer O
- O
based O
exam O
and O
most O
of O
the O
extension O
cords O
were O
two O
- O
prong O
. O

It O
's O
much O
easier O
to O
carry O
around O
the O
keyboard O
instead O
of O
a O
laptop O
. O

Pretty O
straight O
- O
forward O
product O
-- O
a O
case O
with O
3 O
individual O
pouches O
for O
filters O
. O

This O
makes O
adding O
and O
removing O
devices O
a O
bit O
clumsy O
. O

I O
wanted O
the O
best O
, O
so O
I O
got O
this O
one O
. O

He O
's O
pretty O
tech O
savvy O

I O
am O
also O
not O
one O
that O
is O
overly O
concerned O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
speakers O
, O
if O
they O
work O
and O
provide O
good O
sound O
then O
in O
my O
book O

Sometime O
the O
retractable O
head O
can O
not O
fully O
extend O
and O
connect O
into O
the O
usb O
slot O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
it O
worked O
well O

unless O
i O
m O
doing O
something O
wrong O

i. O
e. O
, O
hyper O
fast O
and O
precision O

All O
of O
these O
are O
OK O
, O
IMHO O
. O

Either O
way O

for O

this O
is O
a O

firmware O
from O

I O
put O
it O
back O
in O
my O
bag O
, O
and O
pulled O
it O
out O
days O
later O

None O
of O
the O
cards O
provided O
anything O
approaching O
stable O
operation O
. O

Do O
your O
research O
but O
come O
back O
to O
this O
one O
and O
get O
it O
you O
will O
be O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

I O
also O
carry O
an O
extra O
shirt O
and O
that O
fits O
nicely O
where O
the O
small O
- O
factor O
laptop O
or O
DVD O
player O
would O
go O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
more O
than O
you O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
. O

When O
I O
tried O
to O
replace O
it O
was O
n't O
an O
ease O
job O

so O
while O
using O
the O
power O
from O
the O
port O
, O
another O
device O
can O
be O
connected O
through O
it O
. O

My O
last O
flash O
drive O
( O
a O
PNY O
mini O
attache O
) O
literally O
fell O
apart O
in O
my O
hands O
, O
so O
I O
bought O
something O
better O
this O
time O
. O

Not O
really O
important O
to O
me O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
. O

The O
USB O

give O
you O
the O

for O
about O
12 O

18 O

if O
you O

about O

, O
after O
that O
point O
you O
can O
expect O
to O
see O
declining O
performance O
which O
will O
vary O
but O
as O
a O
general O
rule O
you O
should O
expect O
about O
a O
15%-20 O

decline O

every O
2 O

You O
have O
to O
press O

or O

. O

Hey O
, O
I O
buy O
a O
lot O
of O
electronic O
gadgets O
that O
I O
sometimes O
do O
n't O
need O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
invest O
the O
money O
in O
this O
product O
for O
myself O
or O
anyone O
that O
I O
know O
. O

The O
only O
complain O
I O
have O
is O
the O
manual O
. O

I O
use O
the O
D O
- O
Link O
monitoring O
software O
with O
this O
card O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
fine O
. O

Would O
have O
given O
it O
five O
stars O
if O
the O
driver O
on O
the O
CD O
had O
been O
adequate O
. O

as O
it O
turns O
out O
my O
power O
supply O
was O
not O
producing O
the O
appropriate O
levels O
of O
power O
to O
the O
motherboard O
and O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
juice O
to O
power O
the O
card O
properly O
. O

but O
it O
does O
charge O
right O
up O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
dell O
computer O
says O
. O

LoVQSDpSPF4also O
if O
you O
have O
a O
32bit O
OS O
system O

I O
also O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
buy O
a O
replacement O
for O
just O
the O
receiver O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
a O
laptop O
is O
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
it O
with O
you O
, O
into O
the O
back O
yard O
for O
instance O
. O

I O
love O
the O
glossy O
screen O
, O
makes O
everything O
look O
sharper O
and O
the O
colors O
brighter O
than O
a O
matt O
finish O
screen O
. O

I O
finally O
got O
the O
Nokia O
N810 O
for O
$ O
200 O
. O

This O
size O
fits O
perfectly O
inside O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
bag O
from O
WaterField O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
how O
expensive O
data O
recovery O
is O
? O

Cause O
it O
showed O
up O
beyond O
i O
expected O
.. O
in O
quality O
, O
look O
n O
performence O
wise O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
well O
made O
and O
has O
held O
up O
to O
the O
first O
couple O
weeks O
of O
use O
with O
no O
wear O
or O
damage O
. O

not O
any O
where O
near O
what O
the O
description O
sounded O
like O

Being O

" O
laptop O
, O
this O
thing O
is O
pretty O
big O
, O
however O
it O
still O
remains O
fairly O
portable O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
battery O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

This O
also O
means O
that O
any O
thickness O
of O
drive O
will O
work O
. O

It O
's O
great O
for O
a O
minimal O
shooter O
outing O
. O

I O
had O

The O
only O
games O
are O
Solitaire O
, O
Penguin O

, O
Potato O

, O
and O
bubble O
bobble O
. O

I O
am O
not O
disappointed O
by O
its O
performance O
, O
nor O
am O
I O
overwhelmed O
, O
by O
it O
, O
just O
pleased O
. O

I O
was O
torn O
between O
a O
messenger O
bag O
and O
a O
neoprene O
sleeve O
for O
my O
surface O
pro O
, O
but O
this O
bag O
with O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
tucked O
away O
as O
well O
as O
the O
handles O
( O
which O
slide O
into O
the O
sides O
) O
works O
just O
as O
well O
as O
a O
neoprene O
and O
can O
be O
put O
in O
a O
larger O
bag O
no O
problem O
. O

It O
was O
an O
easy O
purchasing O
decision O
for O
me O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
it O
was O
manufactured O
by O
Case O
Logic O
. O

It O
would O
cost O
me O
more O
to O
send O
it O
back O
as O
a O
return O
than O
it O
would O
to O
just O
keep O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
case O
, O
so O
I O
am O
useing O
this O
case O
every O
day O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
unit O
to O
anyone O
needing O
to O
replace O
their O
charger O

startup O

HP O

is O
tricky O

it O
just O
takes O
longer O
to O
sign O
in O
to O
the O
desktop O
( O
which O
Windows O

will O
essentially O
do O
as O
well O
, O
so O
i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
Windows O

computer O
now)-not O
supreme O
graphics O
or O

for O

/ O

Ok O
this O
this O

So O
, O
look O
for O
that O
one O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
notebook O
bigger O
than O

can O
highly O

this O

on O
both O

the O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

it O
was O

I O
removed O
the O

My O
only O
problem O
with O
it O
is O
that O
if O
you O
lean O
your O
hands O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
laptop O
while O
typing O
the O
edge O
is O
somewhat O
sharp O
and O
bothered O
me O
a O
bit O
. O

The O
interior O
of O
the O
case O
is O
light O
brown O
and O
is O
of O
the O
same O
material O
as O
the O
exterior O
, O
again O
similar O
to O
a O
mousepad O
in O
consistency O
. O

In O
the O
upper O
storage O
compartment O
I O
have O
lens O
cleaners O
, O
two O
remotes O
, O
and O
misc O
cords O
. O

It O
's O
not O
rigid O
enough O
and O
the O
tablet O
just O
falls O
over O
any O
which O
direction.------Update O

There O
is O
also O
a O
multicolored O
LED O
in O
the O
middle O
that O
constantly O
changes O
color O
and O
sometimes O
flashes O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
battery O
that O
could O
hold O
a O
charge O
more O
than O
the O
aging O
stock O
battery O
for O
my O
Dv7 O
Pavillion O
. O

The O
case O
fit O
computer O
snuggly O
and O
its O
perfect O
. O

That O
never O
happened O
. O

The O
temps O
seem O
relatively O
okay O
. O

Easy O
to O
plug O
- O
in O
and O
use O
. O

but O
I O
did O
not O
request O
a O
replacement O
. O

When O
I O
bought O
this O
I O
hesitated O
because O
of O
two O
reasons O
. O

Once O
in O
awhile O
, O
it O
will O
somehow O
turn O
on O
, O
making O
me O
sound O
like O
a O
robot O
. O

This O
one O
has O
excellent O
responsiveness O
and O
is O
great O
for O
SMALLER O
hands O
. O

The O
card O
is O
not O
the O
cure O
- O
all O
for O
the O
digital O
storage O
world O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
this O
review O
it O
was O
only O
about O
fifty O
- O
nine O
bucks O
making O
it O
the O
best O
value O
out O
there O

And O
the O
rain O
really O
does O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

There O
are O
couple O
of O
ways O
to O
install O
SSD O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

I O
used O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
only O
to O
protect O
one O
lens O
, O
or O
to O
protect O
DSLR O
and O
small O
lens O
one O
day O
I O
could O
n't O
carry O
a O
camera O
bag O
, O
and O
had O
to O
put O
it O
in O
my O
regular O
purse O
. O

It O
get O
's O
the O
job O
done O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
as O
I O
had O
hoped O
. O

Other O
reviewers O
said O
it O
was O
comparable O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
just O
going O
to O
believe O
them O
. O

You O
can O
save O
$ O
100 O
or O
more O
by O
not O
paying O
somebody O
else O
to O
install O
it O
! O

Initially O
it O
felt O
almost O
too O
wide O
, O
but O
against O
my O
current O
bag O
( O
mogen O
) O
when O
it O
was O
not O
on O
my O
back O
, O
was O
actually O
narrower O
. O

It O
should O
be O
OK O
based O
on O
the O
amazon O
description O
though O
there O
is O
a O
10amp O
max O
warning O
on O
the O
adapters O
. O

It O
did O
not O
work O
for O
me O
... O
possibly O
because O
I O
have O
Win O
. O

So O
.... O
I O
did O
some O
research O
, O
read O
some O
reviews O
and O
combine O
that O
with O
the O
Price O
... O

Unfortunately O
, O
if O
my O
unit O
is O
any O
indication O
it O
is O
not O
. O

My O
only O
wish O
is O
that O
I O
could O
enable O
" O
both O
" O
the O
laptop O
, O
and O
Logitech O
speakers O
to O
work O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
Pen O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hype O
, O
does O
n't O
write O
fast O
. O

My O
original O
power O
adapter O
had O
gone O
out O
shortly O
before O
my O
travels O
overseas O
. O

Remote O
functions O
as O
described O

6 O
months O
later O
, O
only O
3 O
USB O
ports O
were O
left O
working O
, O
and O
at O
that O
point O
I O
went O
and O
got O
a O
higher O
priced O
but O
higher O
quality O
hub O
. O

that O
's O
the O
good O
news O
. O

I O
really O
bought O
this O
for O
using O
in O
my O
kitchen O

The O
flap O
closure O
is O
very O
secure O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
screen O
could O
use O
a O
better O
view O
angle O
. O

The O
product O
works O
as O
expected O
. O

and O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
bag O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

Would O
reccomend O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
bigger O
chromebook O
with O
a O
glossy O
screen O
instead O
of O
the O
matte O
screen O
on O
the O
249 O
chrome O
book O
. O

Excellent O
product O
! O

I O
would O
buy O
it O
again O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
a O
friend O

whenever O
I O
try O
to O
unplug O
the O
device O
, O
it O
was O
gettingthe O
infamous O
blue O
screen O
of O
windows O
. O

even O
advanced O
PC O
/ O
servers O
do O
not O
start O
in O
a O
fraction O
as O
fest O
as O
this O
. O
until O
you O
will O
not O
use O
it O
you O
will O
not O
believe O
there O
exists O
something O
like O
this O
. O

some O
of O
the O
shots O
were O
20 O
or O
more O
feet O
from O
the O
camera O
and O
it O
worked O
fine O
... O

3 O
laptop O
that O
has O
a O
i-3 O
Intel O
CPU O
. O

This O
is O
a O
portable O
machine O
but O
why O
are O
people O
getting O
this O
over O
the O
Hp O
2540p O
. O

the O
sad O
part O
is O
that O
it O
does O
not O
come O
w/ O
harness O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
attach O
it O
onto O
the O
back O
- O
side O
of O
the O
head O
- O
rest O
of O
the O
front O
driver O
. O

For O
the O
price O
this O
thing O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
IT O
security O
professional O
and O
at O
first O
I O
was O
checking O
patches O
etc O
. O

Also O
there O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
slight O
distortion O
to O
the O
image O
caused O
by O
the O
coating O
on O
the O
panel O
. O

I O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
sound O
quality O
and O
especially O
given O
the O
price O
. O

I O
use O
two O
utilities O
to O
check O
the O
temps O
so O
get O
a O
reletive O
reading O
if O
not O
exact O
. O

Just O
to O
recover O

For O

This O

I O

when O

could O
be O

Then O
you O
plug O
the O

to O
your O
internet O

and O
it O
's O
ready O
to O
install O
the O

I O
do O
some O
light O
travel O
with O
my O

( O
different O
spots O
in O
the O
house O
, O
around O
town O
to O
plug O
in O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
a O
heavy O
duty O
user O
that O
goes O
through O
adapters O
( O

She O
is O
not O
very O
computer O
literate O
but O
was O
able O
to O
quickly O
pick O
up O
the O
Chrome O

and O
get O
to O
her O
normal O
routine O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
will O
rate O
this O
product O
good O
enough O
. O

After O
installing O
these O
it O
pepped O
right O
up O
and O
there O
has O
been O
a O
significant O
improvement O
of O
speed O
. O

I O
had O
been O
a O
bit O
concerned O
whether O
or O
not O
this O
was O
the O
right O
module O
, O
but O
it O
definitely O
is O
the O
one O
. O

Second O
: O
It O
is O
so O
dang O
FAST O
! O

There O
is O
a O
TomTom O
for O
motorcycles O
which O
can O
be O
used O
in O
cars O
, O
too O
. O

There O
are O
no O
tone O
controls O
except O
for O
a O
bass O
boost O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
two O
securing O
screws O
that O
fasten O
the O
connector O
with O
drive O
attached O
to O
the O
container O
are O
too O
small O
, O
and O
after O
a O
few O
removals O
and O
replacements O
, O
will O
strip O
their O
threaded O
holes O
in O
the O
connector O
. O

This O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
for O
my O
new O
iPad O
Mini O
Retina O
. O

The O
feel O
is O
good O
and O
the O
look O
is O
... O
functional O
. O

What O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
, O
after O
paying O
blue O
- O
and O
- O
yellow O
store O
comparable O
price O
for O
this O
camera O
( O
not O
a O
complaint O
) O
is O
that O
I O
had O
to O
drop O
another O
$ O
20 O
bucks O
for O
a O
sideline O
and O
potentially O
short O
lived O
software O
product O
that O
is O
able O
to O
touch O
some O
, O
not O
all O
, O
of O
the O
configuration O
settings O
in O
the O
c920 O
that O
were O
just O
flat O

out O
incorrect O

If O
you O
have O
great O

, O
and O
a O

that O
does O
n't O
provide O
all O
that O
juice O
to O
them O
( O
ie O

, O

, O
this O
is O
a O

alternative O
to O

very O

Usually O

I O
had O
hoped O
to O

concept O
is O
great O
; O
unfortunately O
, O
it O
caused O
problems O
with O
my O
windows O

. O

Sometimes O
it O
would O
drop O
connectivity O
while O
the O
keyboard O
was O
6 O
inches O
away O
from O
it O
, O
and O
then O
switch O
back O

... O
and O
then O
back O
again O
without O
any O
kind O
of O

to O
me O
as O
a O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O

On O
my O

figured O
that O
I O
could O

the O

device O
. O

It O
's O
strong O
point O
is O
a O
very O
simple O
menu O
. O

However O
, O
since O
VGA O
does O
not O
carry O
audio O
, O
the O
adapter O
should O
prevent O
the O
computer O
from O
muting O
its O
internal O
audio O
output O
so O
the O
audio O
output O
jack O
on O
the O
computer O
would O
then O
remain O
active O
. O

.. O
but O
not O
for O
the O
occasional O
or O
stylish O
traveler O
. O

Choose O
the O

and O
it O
works O
perfect O
! O

Pros O
: O
very O
high O
quality O

in O

It O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O

I O
will O
likely O

about O

you O
can O
add O

When O
I O
suggested O
the O
computer O
was O
inoperable O
and O
I O
could O
not O
do O
that O
I O
was O
told O
" O
to O
go O
to O
a O
neighbor O
or O
the O
library O
" O
to O
complete O

Much O
better O
than O

. O

Just O
ordering O
another O
one O
to O
keep O
in O
our O
travel O

.. O

It O
folds O
up O
to O
a O
very O
compact O
size O
. O

The O
great O
thing O
about O
hard O
cases O
is O
that O
you O
can O
get O
them O
in O
different O
colors O
, O
and O
that O
in O
itself O
is O
a O
big O
differentiating O
factor O
. O

I O
think O
if O
your O
laptop O
is O
over O
15 O
inches O
, O
the O
fit O
would O
be O
tight O

My O
initial O
impression O
was O
this O
is O
a O
cheaply O
made O
unit O
. O

Plug O

Play O

And O
was O
packed O
with O
great O

I O
love O
this O

An O
interesting O
prospect O
is O
replacing O
your O

with O
the O
Bamboo O
. O

After O
trying O
numerous O
adapters O
for O
my O
cordless O

, O
this O

is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
works O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
fast O
, O
it O
's O
also O
cool O
, O
nearly O
half O
a O
pound O
lighter O
than O
a O
conventional O

, O
quiet O
and O

- O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
when O
the O

unless O
you O

No O

any O

I O
have O
recently O
upgraded O
my O
camera O
to O
aCanon O
EOS-1D O
X O
, O
so O
I O
needed O
something O
that O
could O
handle O
a O
full O
sized O
camera O
. O

It O
's O
not O
slippery O
and O
noises O
are O
minimum O
. O

Not O
loud O
enough O
. O

My O
work O
around O
was O
to O
buy O

extension O

Overall O
its O
quite O
good O
for O
the O
price O
and O
am O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

Buy O

, O
you O

n't O
be O

Generally O
I O
like O

main O
let O
down O

the O

The O

super O
quiet O
; O
you O
do O
n't O
even O
hear O
it O
running O
, O
not O
ever O
. O

Really O
not O
impressed O
with O
this O
going O
to O
look O
to O
return O
it O
. O

Simply O
turn O
it O
on O
when O
in O

Five O
days O
after O

Great O

Tomorrow O
it O
will O
be O
in O
the O
recycle O
bin O
. O

Obviously O
since O
I O
'm O
using O
a O
Mac O
, O
it O
was O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
plugging O
it O
in O
, O
launching O
Mac O
's O
Disk O
Utility O
and O
setting O
up O
the O
drive O
the O
way O
I O
wanted O
it O
. O

The O
covering O
for O
each O
key O
is O
good O
for O
protection O
but O
bad O
for O
typing O
experience O
. O

If O
your O
needs O
are O
very O
modest O
then O
you O
will O
do O
fine O
with O
this O
. O

The O
after O
getting O
rid O
of O
the O
3rd O
party O
piece O
of O
junk O
, O
the O
Apple O
battery O
would O
only O
allow O
my O
computer O
to O
run O
if O
it O
was O
plugged O
in O
. O

For O
me O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
performance O
bump O
alone O
is O
worth O
the O
extra O
$ O
200 O
. O

I O
have O
this O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
computer O
monitor O
and O
to O
a O
flatscreen O
TV O
, O
and O
it O
works O
effortlessly O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

At O
1/5th O
the O
cost O
of O
an O
OEM O
battery O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

The O
connection O
tip O
, O
is O
the O
wrong O
size O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
mostly O
to O
fill O
a O
need O
I O
've O
had O
for O
some O
time O
, O
namely O
a O
do O
- O
all O
camera O
that O
has O
a O
reasonable O
zoom O
, O
a O
lithium O
- O
ion O
battery O
, O
flash O
memory O
, O
and O
can O
take O
good O
video O
and O
decent O
still O
images O
. O

The O
glare O
on O
the O
other O
brands O
was O
terrible O
compared O
to O
the O
Sony O
even O
with O
the O
sets O
off O
. O

The O
closing O
button O
, O
needs O
some O
assistance O
when O
loading O
a O
drive O
into O
the O
enclosure O
, O
push O
the O
button O
in O
opposite O
direction O
when O
the O
drive O
has O
been O
remounted O
into O
the O
enclosure O
and O
I O
did O
not O
care O
for O
the O
additional O
power O

What O
you O
need O
to O
know:-This O
product O
will O
make O
your O
legs O
cold O

I O
am O
never O
buying O
anything O
on O
this O
website O
ever O
again O

This O
Little O
Device O
is O
really O
well O
thought O
Out O
! O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
chose O
this O
one O
because O
it O
is O
leather O
, O
I O
chose O
blue O
because O
it O
stands O
out O
a O
bit O
more O
in O
a O
bag O
.. O

I O
would O
have O
strongly O
considered O
it O
but O
when O
I O
have O
to O
spend O
an O
additional O
$ O
100-$200 O
on O
a O
separate O
video O
card O
to O
support O
a O

out O

and O
upgrade O
the O
powersupply O
to O
support O
the O
new O

the O
price O
becomes O
too O
high O

Have O
n't O
tried O
the O

the O

ports O

but O
I O
wo O

be O
surprised O
to O
find O
they O

I O

In O
operation O
, O
the O
computer O
seems O
plenty O

I O

loud O

when O

it O

hardly O

it O
is O
noticeable O
and O
is O
highly O
annoying O
. O

The O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
-- O
and O
it O
's O
a O
big O
one O
-- O
is O
that O
it O
's O
awkward O

difficult O

Cons O
: O
it O
's O
not O
really O
Mac O

fault O
but O
adjusting O
to O
a O

with O
no O

takes O
some O
time O
- O
I O
should O
blame O
that O
on O
Windoz O
really O
, O
as O
buttons O
do O
n't O
really O
make O
much O
sense O
. O

And O
I O
absolutely O
HAVE O
to O
mention O
the O
software O
update O
for O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
've O
stuck O
it O
to O
a O
surface O
, O
let O
the O
speaker O
set O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
and O
it O
was O

So O
, O
just O

I O
purchased O

go O

I O
now O
have O
all O
the O

cables O
plugged O
into O
the O
dock O
, O
and O
the O
only O
cables O
I O
run O
to O
the O

are O
the O
AC O

cable O
and O
the O
USB O

The O
only O
time O
the O
fan O
comes O
on O
is O
when O
I O
have O
been O
Skyping O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
time O
. O

As O
I O
mentioned O
before O
, O
it O
allows O
for O
incredible O
freedom O
for O
laptop O
users O
. O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
it O
. O

Those O
are O
both O
easily O
fixed O

I O
starting O
doing O
video O
capturing O
and O
processing O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
for O
my O
youtube O
channel O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
this O
on O
and O
the O
end O
plug O
is O
too O
big O
. O

Because O
of O
their O
business O
policy O
changes O
, O
I O
am O
now O
recommending O
to O
all O
of O
my O
clients O
to O
stay O
far O
away O
from O
Toshiba O
products O
. O

When O
I O
got O
it O
first O
I O
transfer O
all O
my O
gear O
from O
my O
old O
bag O
to O
this O
bag O
. O

BUT O
I O
also O
do O
not O
get O

Now O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
have O
to O
do O
is O
record O

January O
23 O

2013]After O
a O
purchase O
of O
the O
12 O

5 O
size O
screen O
protector O
for O
the O
use O
with O
HP O
2570p O
laptop O
, O
issues O
with O
moira O
patterns O
become O
more O
than O
evident O
. O

Overall O
, O
thrilled O
and O
love O
being O
able O
to O
type O
on O
the O
train O
or O
bus O
. O

The O
bigger O
sized O
cloths O
I O
've O
tried O
are O
substandard O
and O
not O
at O
all O
satisfactory O
. O

The O
colors O
are O
bright O
and O
vivid O
with O
great O
contrast O
and O
saturation O
. O

It O
also O
works O
with O
W7 O
and O
VistaThe O
only O
small O
issue O
with O
it O
is O
that O
as O
a O
low O
cost O
product O
the O
black O
plastic O
which O
holds O
the O
disk O
inside O
is O
a O
bit O
flimsy O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
can O
break O
easily O
. O

I O
've O
had O
it O
about O
a O
month O
now O
and O
the O
only O
program O
I O
have O
added O
has O
been O
Word O
. O

but O
I O
will O
be O
getting O
another O
. O

so O
I O
took O
it O
into O
the O
nearest O
Apple O
store O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
four O
stars O
because O
it O
's O
still O
too O
early O
to O
tell O
if O
it O
deserves O
five O
stars O
from O
me O
. O

Active O
NC O
from O
what O
I O
noticed O
did O
filter O
out O
a O
lot O
of O
lows O
from O
the O
outside O
noise O
and O
just O
a O
bit O
of O
the O
mids O
. O

They O
just O
seem O
to O
the O
job O
exceptionaly O
well O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
nicely O
loud O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
after O
the O
HDMI O
port O
on O
my O
motherboard O
apparently O
died O
( O
along O
with O
the O
corresponding O
port O
on O
the O
receiver O
) O
. O

It O
is O
handy O
to O
have O
two O
and O
when O
the O
original O
finally O
frays O
enough O
that O
it O
no O
longer O
works O
I O
will O
be O
ordering O
another O
one O
just O
like O
this O
. O

While O
incorporating O
the O
charging O
stand O
is O
great O
, O
care O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
if O
kids O
or O
grandkids O
can O
be O
in O
the O
area O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
I O
'd O
improve O
this O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
as O
an O
interim O
connection O
to O
connect O
my O
HD O
Receiver O
to O
my O
old O
( O
non O
- O
HD O
) O
TV O
. O

buying O
that O
cheap O
fosmon O
folio O
that O
looked O
cheap O
and O
fake O
leather O
, O
did O
nt O
hold O
well O
the O
tablet O
, O
did O
nt O
have O
the O
right O
holes O
for O
the O
speakers O
and O
many O
other O
bad O
characteristics O
, O
THIS O
is O
possibly O
the O
best O
choice O
for O
an O
icer O
iconia O
a100 O
case O
. O

There O
is O
also O
no O
doubt O
in O
my O
mind O
that O
if O
I O
ever O
need O
a O
product O
that O
Kinobo O
makes O
, O
I O
will O
be O
purchasing O
the O
brand O
again O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
way O
to O
make O
( O
sales O
) O
presentations O
to O
1 O
or O
2 O
people O
at O
a O
time O
, O
typically O
across O
a O
desk O
or O
a O
restaurant O
table O
. O

I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
USB O
port O
. O

I O
was O
replacing O
my O
5 O
year O
old O
HP O
Dv7 O
Pavilion O
which O
had O
a O
17 O
inch O
screen O
. O

We O
started O
reading O
the O
reviews O
and O
found O
this O
was O
a O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
with O
the O
overly O
sensitive O
touch O
pad O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
any O
improvement O
. O

Subsequent O
uses O
took O
less O
time O
because O
the O
info O
was O
already O
on O
my O
computer O
. O

Some O
might O
have O
found O
the O
input O
, O
tones O
and O
sound O
effects O
helpful O
or O
cute O
or O
even O
sc O
- O
fi O
like O
( O
OK O
, O
that O
one O
may O
be O
so O
) O
but O
I O
found O
both O
the O
button O
sequences O
and O
tone O
patterns O
to O
be O
both O
annoying O
and O
anything O
but O
intuitive O
. O

I O
've O
watched O
people O
spending O
hours O
upon O
hours O
restoring O
their O
smart O
devices O
. O

This O
was O
more O
than O
I O
expected O
for O
the O
price O
. O

If O
you O
keep O
the O
receiver O
in O
the O
computer O
there O
's O
an O
automatic O
power O
off O
after O
thirty O
seconds O
. O

So O
this O
gadget O
saved O
me O
but O
does O
have O
draw O
backs O
. O

I O
use O
both O
SD O
card O
and O
USB O
key O
. O

Works O
as O
designed O
. O

It O
is O
by O
far O
the O
worst O
one O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

We O
use O
them O
quite O
a O
bit O
and O
they O
are O
great O
for O
when O
you O
're O
lonely O
to O
see O
that O
familiar O
face O
. O

If O
a O
time O
arrives O
then O
I O
do O
n't O
take O
the O
whole O
thing O
I O
'll O
have O
a O
case O
. O

It O
's O
as O
long O
as O
I O
need O
it O
to O
be O
, O
and O
it O
works O
. O

Comfortable O
and O
adjustable O
. O

Maybe O
not O
so O
much O
you O
ca O
n't O
put O
it O
in O
your O
pocket O
very O
easily O
. O

The O
Mobile O
Edge O
sleeve O
for O
the O
M14x O
is O
a O
great O
neoprene O
sleeve O
for O
the O
Alienware O
M14x O
( O
R1 O
and O
R2 O
) O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
an O

case O
. O

( O
I O
do O
low O

) O
. O

WIth O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
notebook O
, O
it O
looks O
less O
like O
a O
computer O
& O
therefore O
less O
intrusive O
when O
I O
bring O
it O
into O
meetings O
. O

I O
show O
up O
at O
the O
office O
with O
my O
gear O
AND O
my O
tall O
mug O
of O
espresso O
. O

Everything O
fits O
nicely O
and O
looks O
sharp O
when O
being O
carried O
, O

Arrived O
as O
scheduled O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tight O
squeeze O

I O
wish O
Amazon O
prime O
users O
would O
be O
automatically O
credited O
the O
difference O
when O
items O
are O
reduced O
with O
a O
certain O
elapsed O
time O
. O

It O
does O
have O
USB O
ports O
for O
data O
and O
such O
. O

The O
user O
interface O
is O
better O
. O

Even O
a O
novice O
could O
up O
the O
ram O
or O
change O
the O
hard O
drive- O
Quiet O
and O
does O
n't O
overheat O

That O
's O
good O
for O
getting O
it O
down O
on O
the O
keys O
, O
not O
so O
great O
when O
typing O
makes O
you O
pull O
it O
up O
from O
time O
to O
time O
just O
from O
friction O
with O
your O
fingers O
. O

Apple O
was O
just O
a O
bit O
louder O
. O

Only O
a O
laptop O
that O
has O
instant O
resume O
can O
work O
this O
way O
, O
or O
it O
will O
drive O
you O
crazy O
. O

On O
some O
of O
the O
dark O
scenes O
it O
seems O
like O
the O
TV O
still O
want O
to O
dimm O
out O
but O
is O
fighting O
itself O
. O

Now O
after O
4 O
years O
I O
am O
getting O
a O
gray O
shawdow O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
bend O
over O
because O
I O
have O
back O
problems O
. O

i O
have O
small O
hands O
and O
it O
is O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
me O
to O
use O
as O
my O
full O
- O
time O
mouse O
- O
traveling O
or O
not O
. O

Very O
close O
, O
but O
not O
quite O
it O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
I O
am O
still O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
purcase O
. O

I O
have O
the O
black O
bag O
accented O
with O
red O
, O
very O
simple O
design O
and O
very O
decent O
looking O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
Linux O
rant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
real O
pain O
to O
buy O
any O
machine O
and O
be O
forced O
to O
pay O
for O
an O
OS O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
. O

Since O
I O
had O
Windows O
7 O
( O
it O
's O
now O
Windows O
8) O
, O

The O
cheap O
ones O
he O
had O
always O
buzzed O
when O
my O
cellphone O
was O
anywhere O
near O
them O
& O
it O
drove O
him O
nuts O
. O

My O
Powerlite O
1705C O
's O
are O
dying O
quickly O
, O
bad O
polarizers O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
replacing O
them O
with O
the O
X12 O
. O

For O
85 O
to O
90 O
dollars O
, O
you O
get O

along O
with O

It O
's O
easier O
to O
upgrade O
than O
to O
downgrade O
. O

Touch O
screen O
loses O
its O
efficiency O
as O
the O
screen O
size O
increases O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
for O
the O
life O
of O
me O
figure O
out O
the O
logic O
behind O
this O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
my O
headphones O
or O
speaker O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
mother O
, O
she O
really O
likes O
it O
. O

Buy O
it O
with O
out O
any O
question O
. O

very O
versatile O
strap O
system O
to O
accomadate O

at O

2 O

the O

They O
are O

and O
lightweight O
( O
it O
measures O
3 O
" O

x O
3/4 O
" O
) O
. O

The O
build O
is O
solid O
, O
even O
the O
flipping O
screen O
looks O
like O
it O
could O
withstand O
some O
abuse O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
an O
average O
USB O
able O
to O
stretch O
10 O
feet O
, O
buy O
it O
. O

Considering O
the O
low O
cost O
of O
these O
speakers O
I O
can O
say O
with O
all O
honesty O
that O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
them O
. O

I O
just O
pushed O
it O
back O
into O
where O
it O
obviously O
went O
. O

The O
case O
itself O
is O
nice O
quality O
. O

If O
I O
used O
this O
laptop O
all O
the O
time O
, O
I O
be O
use O
to O
it O
after O
short O
while O

its O
an O

None O
of O
my O
expensive O

exploded O

The O
charger O
looked O
cheap O
, O
i O
simply O
would O
nt O
buy O
another O
unit O
. O

Minor O
, O
but O
worth O
mentioning O
. O

This O
USB O
had O
charged O
my O
phone O
from O
20 O
to O
over O
50 O
% O

the O
color O

on O

Windows O
7 O
PC O
, O
( O
does O
not O
work O
on O
XP O
without O
a O
few O
extra O
steps O
) O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
case O
if O
you O
need O
to O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
extra O
stuff O
along O
. O

Arrived O
on O
time O
and O
as O
described O
. O

The O
volume O
and O
clarity O
is O
beyond O
what O
I O
ever O
expected O
from O
such O
a O
small O
device O
, O
even O
though O
I O
am O
a O
devoted O
fan O
of O
Logitech O
products O
. O

It O
is O
a O
quality O
product O
and O
very O
comfortable O
to O
use O
laptop O
while O
sitting O
. O

Really O
enhances O
my O
iPad O
mini O
experience O
. O

I O
owned O
this O
laptop O
for O
about O
a O
year O
. O

For O
$ O
25 O
the O
FE6 O
comes O
well O
built O
, O
and O
with O
fairly O
nice O
packaging O
for O
something O
so O
simple O
. O

HIGHLY O
recommend O
picking O
up O
a O
SSD O
for O
it O
. O

There O
is O
material O
separating O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
from O
the O
zipper O
. O

This O
thing O
was O
bought O
to O
replace O
the O
crappy O
internal O
WiFi O
that O
came O
with O
my O
desktop O
PC O
. O

On O
a O
laptop O
I O
have O
the O
keys O
memorized O
and O
can O
type O
without O
much O
light O
- O

when O
I O
started O
the O
initial O
HP O
Chromebook O
setup O
, O
I O
apparently O
had O
access O
to O
it O
. O

I O
could O
go O
on O
and O
on O

This O
battery O
has O
been O
great O
. O

Then O
I O
noticed O
many O
games O
I O
have O
, O
yahoo O
messenger O
, O
and O
an O
assortment O
of O
other O
programs O
stopped O
working O
, O
they O
would O
all O
generate O
crash O
reports O
upon O
launching O
. O

The O
most O
impressive O
feature O
is O
its O
light O
weight O
and O
long O
battery O
performance O

The O
unit O
gets O
a O
little O
warmer O
that O
what O
I O
would O
think O
to O
be O
normal O
but O
it O
continues O
to O
work O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
fine O
for O
occasional O
use O

I O
keep O
this O
in O
my O
car O

It O
also O
has O
an O
outside O
compartment O
for O
a O
water O
bottle O
, O
etc O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'll O
find O
another O
use O
for O
them O
. O

and O
I O
probably O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
more O
for O
anything O
better O
. O

The O
video O
was O
very O
choppy O
even O
at O
lower O
resolutions O
. O

I O
did O
not O
expect O
much O
from O
this O
cheaper O
, O
plastic O
, O
single O
fan O
Logitech O
, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
more O
expensive O
Zalman O
. O

It O
works O
great O
as O
long O
as O
you O
know O
all O
the O
multi O
- O
gestures O
. O

but O
you O
need O
to O
lower O
it O
if O
you O
watch O
videos O
etc O

the O
Kicker O
ZK500 O
Zune O
Speaker O
Dock O
and O
I O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

The O
hassle O
free O
packaging O
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
and O
it O
had O
a O
great O
price O
, O
too O
. O

We O
bought O
four O
of O
them O
on O
amazon O
and O
do O
n't O
use O
them O
anymore O
. O

* O
Generally O
runs O
cooler O
than O
previous O
models O

So O
poorly O
written O
in O
Chinese O
- O
American O
its O
almost O
comical O
. O

High O
quality O
and O
great O
product O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
cool O
factor O

the O
led O
's O
went O
out O
on O
one O
side O
when O
using O
to O
look O
outdoors O
there O
was O
no O
light O
adjustment O
everything O
was O
whited O
out O
for O
the O
cheap O
price O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Prices O
seem O
a O
little O
steep O
here O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
this O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
tough O
to O
get O
on O
to O
my O
car O
with O
my O
dashboard O
layout O
. O

Have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
this O
cable O
or O
any O
other O
ones O
I O
've O
bought O
. O

: O
cables O
are O
included O
- O
nice O
touch O
! O

I O
plugged O
it O
in O
the O
USB O
port O
and O
in O
five O
seconds O
I O
was O
connected O
. O

And O
it O
's O
incredibly O
light O
, O
adding O
almost O
nothing O
to O
the O
weight O
of O
what O
you O
put O
into O
it O
. O

but O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
the O
card O
's O
fault O
, O
but O
I O
was O
wrong O
, O
I O
had O
to O
restore O
my O
computer O
due O
to O
a O
virus O

It O
is O
able O
to O
pick O
up O
more O
than O
50 O
stations O
with O
the O
small O
antenna O
provided O
with O
this O
product O
, O
which O
is O
comparable O
to O
my O
friend O
's O
Google O
TV O
with O
a O
big O
antenna O
. O

I O
'd O
rather O
have O
been O
able O
to O
get O
the O
original O
DX O
cover O
, O
but O
that O
ship O
has O
sailed O
. O

It O
works O
very O
well O
and O
is O
very O
portable O
. O

The O
keys O
need O
to O
be O
pressed O
very O
hard O
to O
make O
contact O
. O

Great O
product O
. O

The O
cover O
causes O

I O
am O
using O
the O
new O
battery O
and O
still O
notice O
that O
the O
battery O
only O
last O
about O
an O
hour O
or O
so O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
PCI O
which O
get O
the O
rating O
fantastic O

Great O
replacement O
for O
the O
OEM O
battery O
. O

then O
i O
installed O
it O
to O
my O
x64 O

box O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Like O
most O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
, O
I O
got O
this O
because O
the O
other O
cases O
available O
for O
the O
Nook O
are O
fairly O
large O
and O
would O
add O
considerable O
bulk O
to O
the O
otherwise O
slim O
eReader O
. O

so O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
replaced O
it O
with O
the O
Asus O

TF810C. O
ATOM O
tablet O

you O
just O
want O
to O
use O
the O
browser O
in O
full O

( O
F11 O
) O

Unlike O
so O
many O
sleeves O
, O
this O
one O
does O
n't O
smell O
bad O
. O

I O
think O
you O
get O
2 O
if O
you O
buy O
the O
kit O
. O

This O
means O
its O
real O
slow O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
copy O

It O
's O
2012 O
and O
my O
M9040n O

, O
I O
have O
upgraded O
to O
the O
8 O
GB O

max O
and O
Windows O
7 O
PRO O
x64 O
bit O
, O
replaced O
my O

after O
it O
went O
out O
and O
now O
replacing O
the O
8800 O

card O
after O
it O
went O
out O
to O
a O

1 O
GB O
graphics O
card O
. O

and O
I O
needed O
a O
smaller O
tablet O
to O
bring O
with O
me O
during O
my O
frequent O
travels O
and O
especially O
with O
a O
front O
camera O
to O
videocall O
home O
via O
Skype O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
is O
faster O
than O
a O
traditional O
Drive O
. O

* O
More O
than O
large O
enough O
for O
a O
15-inch O
widescreen O
laptop O
. O

Well O
, O
about O
a O
month O
later O
this O
battery O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
charged O
for O
roughly O
2 O
hours O
of O
wi O
- O
fi O
web O
browsing O
( O
nothing O
too O
heavy O
, O
a O
couple O
tabs O
open O
and O
maybe O
music O
running O
) O
. O

I O
've O
upgraded O
to O
SSD O
and O
really O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
to O
an O
SSD O
and O
anything O
else O
. O

Close O
enough O
! O

Not O
many O
companies O
we O
know O
go O
this O
distance O
to O
make O
a O
customer O
satisfied O
. O

Note O
that O
this O
is O
a O
software O
problem O
and O
NOT O
camera O
problem O
although O
one O
could O
argue O
that O
it O
's O
all O
inter O
related O
. O

That O
was O
pretty O
darn O
fast O
shipping O
and O
the O
unit O
does O
test O
out O
to O
15 O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
box O
I O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
look O
and O
feel O
. O

My O
best O
advice O
: O
save O
up O
to O
buy O
a O
Mac O
or O
buy O
an O
HP O
for O
$ O
250 O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

The O
power O
ratings O
are O
continuous O
, O
not O
peak O
like O
some O
manufacturers O
use O
to O
sound O
better O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
Toshiba O
again O
. O

Go O
with O
a O
Jansports O

I O
am O
not O
certain O
why O
this O
is O
since O
my O
2408WFP O
allows O
this O
. O

My O
only O
issues O
with O
Thermaltake O
is O
that O
one O
has O
not O
been O
made O
with O
Firewire O
800 O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
get O
used O
to O
it O
, O
but O
I O
really O
hated O
it O
, O
so O
it O
got O
replaced O
with O
a O
full O
- O
blown O
Logitech O
board O
which O
works O
just O
great O

I O
would O
rate O
it O
as O
a O
" O
perfect O
" O
5 O
were O
there O
a O
better O
solution O
for O
attaching O
it O
to O
the O
Macbook O
Air O
. O

and O
then O
it O
started O
to O
crap O
out O
. O

Fast O
shipping O
too O
. O

1 O
year O
warranty O
if O
bought O
new O
. O

I O
am O
satisfied O
with O
the O
battery O
life O
so O
far O
. O

So O
I O
wanted O
one O
too O
, O
ordered O
it O
, O
and O
put O
it O
on O
. O

com O
, O
entered O
my O
activation O
code O
, O
downloaded O
and O
installed O
my O
version O
for O
free O
. O

I O
find O
that O
some O
of O
my O
devices O
can O
not O
fit O
into O
that O
port O
. O

I O
was O
tempted O
to O
pull O
the O
heatspreaders O
off O
and O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
chips O
themselves O
, O
but O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
mess O
with O
it O
. O

So O
lets O
see O
how O
long O
this O
battery O
really O
lasts O
before O
I O
get O
annoyed O
enough O
to O
file O
a O
warranty O
on O
it O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
starters O
, O
this O
product O
will O
not O
convert O
any O
voltage O
for O
you O

I O

No O

or O
the O

switch O
either O
. O

Worked O
as O
promised O
, O
direct O
fit O
and O
extended O
the O
life O
of O
the O
laptop O
which O
otherwise O
was O
working O
perfectly O
. O

and O
I O
was O
getting O
worried O
. O

The O
materials O
seem O
like O
in O
a O
good O
quality O
except O
the O
two O
plastic O
locking O
devices O
that O
keep O
the O
cover O
close O
. O

All O
in O
all O
I O
'm O
satisfied O
, O
and O
if O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
the O
dividers O
and O
the O
flimsy O
handle O
I O
would O
give O
five O
starts O
to O
this O
. O

I O
noticed O
this O
especially O
when O
kids O
were O
using O
it O
and O
played O
a O
game O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
then O
hit O
the O
home O
button O
and O
tried O
another O
game O
, O
then O
kept O
doing O
that O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
laptop O
outside O
... O

Digital O
readout O
never O
worked O
right O
, O
new O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

and O
it O
's O
pretty O
solid O
, O
it O
can O
run O
newer O
games O
well O
with O
high O
graphics O
, O
just O
ca O
n't O
stand O
windows O
8 O
... O
its O
good O
for O
a O
phone O
but O
not O
a O
computer O
... O

But O
the O
point O
is O
it O
should O
have O
worked O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Medialink O
wireless O
N O
adapter O
since O
they O
were O
both O
150 O
Mbps O
. O

Wish O
the O
keyboard O
would O
light O
up O
, O
hard O
to O
see O
at O
times O
. O

The O
fan O
blows O
very O
hot O
air O
and O
spots O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
laptop O
get O
hot O
. O

Now O
, O
18 O
months O
later O
, O
the O
battery O
is O
useless O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
third O
computer O
for O
use O
when O
I O
was O
away O
from O
my O
desktop O
system O
and O
ultra O
portable O
light O
weight O
. O

Despite O
these O
issues O
, O
however O
, O
I O
still O
like O
the O
case O
so O
far O
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
with O
few O
complaints O
. O

Light O
and O
reasonably O
thin O
. O

This O
thing O
has O
protected O
my O
laptop O
from O
some O
short O
falls O
, O
and O
scratches O

Just O
remmeber O
that O
you O
have O
to O

your O

software O
first O
( O
over O
dialup O
, O
whick O
took O
90 O
minutes O
) O
to O
5 O
. O

Some O
other O
cables O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
stiff O
. O

Just O
as O
if O
it O
was O
the O
same O
one O
from O
when O
i O
got O
the O
unit O
at O
first O

3 O
years O
of O
usage O
and O
still O
being O
used O
. O

It O
works O
but O
boy O
you O
got O
ta O
be O
patient O
. O

I O
love O
both O
OS O

IBM O
Thinkpads O
( O
remember O
those O
! O
? O
) O
were O
smaller O
, O
too O
, O
but O
felt O
like O
bricks O
in O
your O
hand O
! O

I O
bought O
this O
monitor O
about O
two O
weeks O
ago O
and O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
. O

There O
is O
a O
strap O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
case O
so O
the O
telescoping O
handle O
of O
a O
rolling O
piece O
of O
luggage O
can O
be O
threaded O
through O
it O
permitting O
it O
to O
rest O
on O
top O
of O
the O
luggage O
and O
be O
wheeled O
along O
as O
one O
unit O
. O

I O
never O
needed O
to O
read O
instructions O
, O
and O
the O
entire O
process O
worked O
flawlessly O
. O

Great O
product O
. O

If O
the O
Satellite O
only O
had O
a O
better O
battery O
, O
I O
'd O
rate O
this O
a O
top O
- O
class O
road O
warrior O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
very O
good O
combo O
buy O
as O
I O
needed O
both O
a O
portable O
speaker O
and O
a O
bluetooth O
headphones O
, O
and O
for O
the O
price O
I O
figured O
if O
any O
one O
of O
them O
is O
good O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
buy O
. O

and O
this O
is O
easier O
to O
set O
- O
up O
. O

The O
overall O
build O
quality O
is O
fine O
if O
not O
impressive O
. O

quite O
honestly O
I O
am O
disappointed O
that O
Canon O
would O
not O
throw O
it O
in O
the O
box O
. O

But O
it O
fits O
nicely O
, O
so O
apparently O
these O
batteries O
are O
more O
standardized O
than O
I O
thought O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
it O
will O
happen O
you O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
biggest O
feature O
of O
the O
mouse O
is O
its O
ability O
to O
store O
and O
charge O
within O
a O
PCI O
- O
Express O
slot O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
a O
excellent O
value O
. O

It O
works O
wonderfully O
, O
bumping O
up O
RAM O
from O
a O
sluggish O
256 O
MB O
to O
768 O
MB O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
the O
command O
got O
there O
. O

It O
's O
about O
as O
big O
( O
only O
very O
slight O
taller O
) O
than O
the O
Apple O
Magic O
Mouse O
. O

Good O
stuff O
will O
buy O
again O
when O
these O
are O
used O
up O
. O

and O
I O
kept O
on O
being O
surprised O
that O
something O
was O
done O
already O
. O

The O
Elan O
drivers O
allow O
you O
to O
tweak O
the O
sensitivity O
and O
size O
of O
the O
automatic O
touchpad O
disabling O
feature O
during O
keyboard O
input O
. O

They O
are O
well O
- O
built O
, O
extremely O
portable O
and O
very O
reliable O
. O

Very O
simple O
, O
even O
for O
me O
. O

To O
put O
that O
in O
perspective O
, O
previously O
when O
we O
wanted O
to O
watch O
a O
TV O
show O
on O
our O
HDTV O
played O
on O
our O
laptop O
, O
I O
had O
to O
connect O
the O
laptop O
and O
then O
leave O
it O
over O
by O
the O
TV O
. O

Really O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
pass O
through O
USB O

Does O
n't O
work O
on O
an O
older O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Yes O
it O
does O
indeed O
work O
well O
in O
Linux O
, O
with O
full O
packet O
injection O
support O
. O

8x O
DVD O
Writer O
External O
Optical O
Drive O
for O
Mac O
and O
PC O

It O
has O
a O
Very O
Professional O
Look O
to O
it O
and O
is O
Very O
easy O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

When O
the O
GF O
is O
not O
home O
, O
I O
can O
always O
crack O
a O
window O
and O
freeze O
myself O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
my O
laptop O
. O

My O
Asus O
slimline O
laptop O
was O
a O
great O
machine O
but O
over O
time O
, O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
times O
I O
open O
and O
close O
the O
lid O
, O
pull O
from O
bag O
, O
lug O
around O
everywhere O

Still O
, O
its O
aluminum O
case O
feels O
sturdy O
, O
giving O
me O
confidence O
that O
the O
eGo O
can O
withstand O
some O
bumping O
around O
. O

I O
got O
two O
at O
a O
very O
handsome O
price O
here O
on O
Amazon O
. O

shipped O
fast O
, O
great O
price O
and O
it O
actually O
works O
fine O
.the O

After O
an O
over O
- O
the O
- O
phone O
attempt O
fix O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
a O
software O
problem O
, O
I O
had O
to O
mail O
the O
laptop O
in O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
price O
and O
works O
great O
. O

I O
like O
this O
even O
when O
sitting O
at O
a O
table O
. O

Retina O
screen O
is O
nice O
, O
and O
I O
use O
it O
in O
1680x1050 O
resolution O
, O
which O
gives O
much O
more O
screen O
space O
compared O
to O
13&#34 O
; O

A O
different O
material O
choice O
would O
make O
this O
much O
better O
; O
an O
awesome O
design O
though O
! O

I O
working O
on O
a O
church O
project O
the O
computer O
lose O
power O
while O
its O
plugged O
in O
. O

Very O
compact O
and O
versatile O
reader O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
very O
sharp O
and O
bright O
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
two O
pieces O
of O
plastic O
and O
an O
adhesive O
, O
but O
overall O
it O
does O
what O
it O
says O
. O

I O
know O
that O
this O
is O
an O
issue O
with O
a O
cable O
because O
after O
this O
cable O
did O
n't O
work O
, O
I O
purchased O
a O
more O
expensive O
one O
and O
did O
n't O
get O
the O
ghosting O
issue O
. O

one O
of O
the O
8Gb O
memory O
has O
a O
fault O
, O
so O
gives O
me O
blue O
screen O
on O
windows O
sometimes O
. O

Would O
have O
given O
this O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
I O
found O
out O
when O
taking O
this O
dock O
on O
a O
trip O
that O
the O
" O
stainless O
steel O
" O
finish O
scratches O
VERY O
easily O
if O
it O
comes O
in O
contact O
with O
something O
else O
metal O
. O

This O
past O
weekend O
two O
of O
us O
were O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
and O
I O
started O
a O
Netflix O
movie O
and O
no O
matter O
how O
I O
adjusted O
the O
machine O

Its O
not O
only O
laptop O
backpack O
, O
but O
you O
can O
use O
it O
for O
college O
also O
. O

Overall O
: O
GOOD O
! O

The O
exterior O
is O
mostly O
black O
neoprene O
, O
guessing O
3 O
mm O
thick O
. O

For O
me O
it O
's O
not O
the O
looks O
that O
are O
an O
issue O
, O
but O
the O
case O
itself O
has O
some O
odd O
angles O
which O
I O
personally O
find O
can O
make O
for O
occasional O
uncomfortable O
wrist O
positions O
when O
trying O
to O
type O
. O

I O
've O
been O
searching O
for O
a O
case O
this O
size O
for O
awhile O
and O
when O
I O
would O
find O
it O
would O
be O
so O
over O
priced O
. O

I O
own O
a O
PC O
and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
my O
Toshiba O
15 O
. O

- O
if O
your O
items O
do O
n't O
fit O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
fit O
. O

I O
set O
that O
bad O
boy O
up O
to O
" O
dot11 O
wpa O
handshake O
timeout O
500 O
" O
and O
to O
quote O
Emeril O
, O
BAM O
! O

I O
own O
an O
iPhone O
4S O
and O
an O
iPad O
2 O
and O
I O
am O
totally O
enjoying O
them O
. O

Not O
impossible O
, O
but O
it O
'll O
make O
the O
bag O
bulky O
. O

I O
contacted O
Samsung O
over O
the O
phone O
and O
after O
going O
through O
the O
routine O
with O
the O
tech O
support O
they O
finally O
asked O
me O
to O
send O
it O
for O
repairs O
. O

This O
will O
not O
power O
a O
hair O
dryer O
, O
but O
it O
's O
good O
for O
your O
more O
delicate O
electronics O
. O

6L O
I O
recently O
bought O
does O
n't O
fit O
through O
the O
suspension O
system O
this O
bag O
has O
in O
place O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
buy O
! O

I O
noticed O
a O
review O
that O
tried O
to O
down O
- O
play O
the O
cooling O
capabilities O
of O
this O
cooler O
. O

The O
unit O
is O
rechargeable O
using O
the O
included O
USB O
cable O
. O

Adding O
AirPort O
Express O
to O
another O
AirPort O
bas O
station O
can O
greatly O
increase O
the O
wireless O
coverage O
. O

If O
you O
have O
invested O
heavily O
in O
a O
Macbook O
, O
tablet O
or O
other O
gear O
that O
you O
carry O
with O
you O
all O
the O
time O
, O
invest O
a O
little O
more O
in O
this O
bag O
. O

The O
48Watt O
brick O
charger O
included O
seemed O
big O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
tablet O
device O
. O

; O
On O
Windows O
make O
sure O
that O
bluetooth O
is O
not O
turned O
off O
when O
it O
is O
not O
in O
use O
to O
save O
power O
. O

I O
bought O
an O
inexpensive O
hard O
drive O
enclosure O
( O
thisone O
) O
. O

Other O
users O
online O
claimed O
that O
the O
retina O
display O
give O
them O
image O
retention O
, O
but O
I O
have O
not O
notice O
anything O
on O
mine O
screen O
nor O
do O
I O
see O
any O
screen O
lag O
when O
scrolling O
. O

The O
retractable O
usb O
connector O
on O
this O
pen O
drive O
is O
a O
definite O
plus O
. O

The O
case O
can O
easily O
get O
scratched O
but O
that O
s O
what O
its O
for O
, O
right O
? O

Okay O
, O
but O
no O
thanks O
! O

The O
complaints O
on O
glare O

It O
's O
solid O
, O
light O
, O
and O
well O
laid O
out O
. O

I O
use O
them O
for O
my O
sunglasses O
, O
my O
TV O
's O
my O
laptop O
monitor O
, O
for O
my O
DSLR O
lenses O
. O

Me O
gusta O
mucho O
. O

Guess O
I O
'll O
buy O
another O
for O
the O
wife O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
and O
portable O
USB O
solution O
, O
this O
product O
will O
do O
the O
job O
. O

Given O
that O
it O
has O
essentially O
the O
same O
charging O
specs O
( O
you O
ca O
n't O
use O
standard O
car O
cell O
phone O
, O
USB O
- O
based O
chargers O
with O
the O
Samsung O
Tab O
's O
cables O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
supply O
enough O
current O
; O
both O
the O
Belkin O
and O
the O
OEM O
chargers O
are O
about O
2 O
Amp O
units O
) O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
that O
the O
Belkin O
is O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
OEM O
unit O
. O

In O
a O
60-day O
period O
, O
I O
've O
only O
had O
to O
reset O
once O
. O

Does O
what O
you O
would O
expect O
acceptably O
. O

, O
really O
loaded O
with O
crapware O
( O
but O
that O
is O
typical O
of O
almost O
any O
PC O
notebook O
today O
, O
especially O
HP O
- O
check O
out O
pc O
decrapifier O
) O

( O
I O
upgraded O
it O
to O
8 O
gb O

I O
use O
this O
with O
an O
iPhone O
5 O
and O
either O
a O
pair O
of O
Sony O
MDR O
- O
V700 O
over O
ear O
headphones O
or O
Shure O
SE O
535 O
ear O
buds O
. O

To O
me O
, O
that O
sounds O
like O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
for O
days O
when O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
working O
online O
all O
day O
. O

If O
you O
use O
your O
computer O
for O
photos O
, O
Picasa O
, O
or O
even O
playing O
videos O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
this O
is O
not O
ideal O
. O

I O
currently O
have O
it O
configured O
to O
match O
the O
color O
of O
my O
G105 O
MW3 O

have O
the O
awesome O
nano O
receiver O
, O
laser O
tracking O
, O
and O
storage O
of O
the O
nano O
receiver O
inside O
the O
mouse O
itself O
when O
not O
in O
use O
. O

I&#8217;ve O
sort O
of O
tested O
the O
units O
range O
. O

it O
is O
big O
enough O
. O

I O
like O
the O
back O
compartment O
for O
storing O
USB O
cables O
. O

6 O
GB O
of O
memory O
is O
decent O
, O
but O
the O
5400 O
rpm O
hard O
drive O
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
( O
takes O
programs O
longer O
to O
load O
into O
memory O
, O
including O
Windows O
bootup O
) O
. O

I O
read O
a O
few O
reviews O
here O
that O
hase O
some O
issues O
with O
it O
in O
car O
.... O

There O
were O
some O
complaints O
about O
the O
keyboard O
which O
almost O
made O
me O
skip O
this O
machine O

Can O
not O
say O
how O
this O
service O
compares O
to O
other O
no O
contract O
wireless O
broadband O
service O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
big O
improvement O
over O
dial O
- O
up O
. O

These O
days O
, O
despite O
the O
omnipresence O
of O
wireless O
, O
I O
find O
I O
have O
to O
carry O
many O
more O
cables O
and O
accessories O
, O
and O
this O
bag O
seems O
to O
accommodate O
everything O
with O
no O
trouble O
. O

And O
even O
with O
this O
level O
of O
care O
, O
almost O
one O
third O
of O
the O
key O
presses O
do O
nothing O
. O

Great O
value O
for O
the O
price O
! O

Case O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Good O
for O
the O
money O
compared O
to O
the O
Apple O
one O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
way O
too O
short O
but O
a O
3 O
' O
extension O
cord O
allowed O
me O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
my O
surge O
protector O
. O

The O
USB O
cable O
is O
about O
2 O
feet O
long O
, O
and O
the O
power O
cable O
is O
about O
30 O
inches O
long O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
basic O
mic O
to O
detract O
from O
the O
feedback O
my O
typing O
would O
have O
during O
Google O
Hangouts O
hosted O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

After O
some O
research O
, O
I O
suspect O
it O
is O
a O
faulty O
video O
cable O
that O
passes O
through O
the O
hinges O
. O

It O
's O
difficult O
to O
build O
reliable O
RF O
amplifiers O
that O
perform O
that O
well O
, O
have O
low O
self O
- O
jamming O
noise O
, O
fit O
into O
a O
tiny O
enclosure O
, O
and O
still O
cost O
only O
a O
few O
dollars O
to O
make O
. O

The O
compartments O
are O
useful O
and O
accessible O
when O
needed O
, O
with O
well O
- O
sized O
pockets O
and O
spots O
for O
mp3 O
, O
phone O
, O
calculator O
, O
whatever O
. O

And O
has O
a O
nice O
little O
blue O
light O
on O
it O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
problem O
of O
losing O
pictures O
like O
what O
some O
other O
people O
had O
reported O
. O

It O
does O
power O
USB O
devices O
, O
making O
it O
handy O
for O
charging O
multiple O
USB O
- O
ported O
cellphones O
, O
MP3 O
players O
, O
etc O
, O
when O
on O
the O
road O
. O

There O
's O
also O
a O
great O
video O
that O
shows O
this O
step O
by O
step O
. O

This O
battery O
is O
awesome O
for O
what O
you O
pay O
. O

am O
happy O
with O
this O
Plugable O
adapter O
. O

Problem O
was O
the O
internal O
speakers O
do O
not O
work O
- O
plug O
in O
headphones O
there O
is O
sound O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

This O
was O
purchased O
for O
my O
son O
's O
7&#34 O
; O
tablet O
. O

It O
's O
a O
keyboard O
that O
works O
when O
you O
need O
and O
want O
it O
to O
. O

This O
replacement O
unit O
has O
been O
working O
great O
. O

If O
they O
have O
dedicated O
power O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
over O
thirty O
bucks O
. O

this O
TV O
is O
so O
revealing O
that O
it O
is O
quite O
cruel O
to O
a O
poor O
source O
. O

Adjust O
the O
brightness O
to O
your O
liking O
and O
away O
you O
go O
. O

I O
already O
purchased O
an O
STM O
for O
my O
iPad O
and O
knew O
there O
had O
to O
be O
one O
that O
fits O
the O
Iconia O
W700 O
! O

" O

for O

your O

? O

All O
of O
my O
other O
BT O
keyboards O
connect O
automatically O
. O

The O
Mac O
also O
has O
the O
standard O
USB O
ports O
( O
3 O
of O
them O
, O

USB O
2 O

. O

Hardly O
worth O
complaining O
about O
. O

I O
use O
them O
to O
hold O
iPhone O
& O
iPad O
charging O
cables O
in O
numerous O
areas O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
like O
about O
the O
battery O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
& O
# O
34;foot&#34 O
; O
, O
so O
that O
now O
my O
Dell O
is O
slightly O
( O
not O
much O
) O
inclined O
when O
I O
have O
the O
battery O
in O
place O
. O

I O
ran O
CUPID O
HWMonitor O
and O
the O
temperature O
on O
GPU O

Had O
this O
on O
my O
Mac O
since O
Oct O
and O
makes O
it O
look O
good O
however O
the O
rubber O
bumpers O
on O
the O
bottom O
came O
off O
( O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
) O
and O
the O
corners O
are O
cracked O
on O
both O
the O
front O
two O
corners O
on O
the O
bottom O
part O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
using O
this O
for O
all O
my O
computing O
functions O
, O
but O
what O
I O
want O
this O
to O
do O
, O
it O
does O
well O
. O

Good O
product O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
. O

On O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
main O
speaker O
is O
an O
" O
audio O
input O
" O
plug O
where O
you O
can O
connect O
an O
external O
audio O
device O
like O
an O
iPod O
, O
or O
a O
computer O
without O
FireWire O
. O

And O
, O
there O
's O
really O
no O
design O
or O
style O
to O
it O
... O

even O
an O
issue O
anyway O
. O

If O
you O
have O
even O
a O
moderate O
breeze O
expect O
your O
image O
to O
be O
shaky O
and O
blurry O
. O

I O
used O
a O
lots O
of O
the O
feedback O
from O
previous O
reviews O
and O
for O
that O
I O
thank O
those O
who O
took O
time O
to O
provide O
the O
info O
. O

The O
XPad O
is O
great O
on O
a O
sofa O
or O
bed O
where O
you O
might O
sit O
the O
notebook O
on O
a O
blanket O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
needed O
to O
get O
the O
10 O
watt O
though O
... O

I O
felt O
of O
the O
bottom O
, O
and O
it O
was O
burning O
hot O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
key O
features O
, O
the O
audio O
port O
toggle O
switch O
and O
the O
power O
saving O
mode O
, O
are O
both O
controlled O
by O
Windows O
specific O
software O
. O

My O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
cord O
between O
the O
& O
# O
34;brick&#34 O
; O
part O
and O
the O
plug O
into O
the O
computer O
is O
extremely O
short O
( O
close O
to O
2 O
feet O
shorter O
than O
my O
old O
PS O
) O
. O

Not O
anything O
amazing O
, O
but O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

A O
great O
product O
at O
a O
great O
price O
, O
along O
with O
fast O
shipping O
! O

The O
interface O
seems O
to O
work O
properly O
but O
the O
drive O
I O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
on O
seems O
more O
damaged O
than O
I O
had O
originally O
thought O
. O

It O
will O
hold O
only O
the O
netbook O
and O
not O
the O
electrical O
adapter O
or O
mouse O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
like O
this O
mouse O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
I O
would O
get O
constant O
disconnects O
. O

and O
I O
wanted O
something O
that O
I O
could O
just O
plug O
and O
play O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
searching O
for O
drivers O
. O

The O
price O
is O
second O
to O
none O
and O
the O
box O
it O
comes O
in O
was O
nice O
for O
gift O
- O
giving O
. O

In O
summation O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
great O
piece O
of O
equipment O
for O
any O
person O
that O
is O
willing O
to O
work O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
it O
right O
. O

It O
says O
" O
not O
optimized O
for O
this O
accessory O
" O
and O
that O
little O
warning O
that O
pops O
up O
on O
the O
iPhone O

The O
unit O
has O
excellent O
audio O
for O
a O
TV O
, O
especially O
after O
you O
take O
time O
to O
tweak O
the O
many O
available O
sound O
options O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
mouse O
buttons O
are O
weird O
and O
clicking O
is O
sort O
of O
an O
exercise O
. O

oh O
well O
... O
it O
works O
anyway O
, O
and O
that O
is O
what O
is O
important O

This O
item O
saved O
my O

I O
like O
having O
2 O
hi O

output O
USB O
ports O
plus O
the O
power O
output O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
say O
its O
probably O
better O
than O
the O
2 O

HP O
or O
Kodaks O
. O

but O
the O
memory O
is O
not O
upgradable O

I O
had O

using O

and O
, O
sure O
enough O
, O
the O
result O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O

, O
so O
I O
hereby O
add O
back O
that O
star O
. O

god O
knows O
how O
long O
to O
have O
it O
sent O
back O
. O

I O
mostly O
dabble O
on O
the O

side O

I O
do O

It O
has O
a O

. O

Needs O
small O

but O
better O
than O
using O

this O

a O

Great O

This O
is O
n't O
as O

safe O
as O
an O
actual O
buckle O
( O
in O
case O
you O
forget O
to O
zip O
up O
the O

) O
but O
it O
works O
well O
at O
what O
it O
's O
designed O
to O
do O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O

The O
slight O

makes O
for O
much O
more O
comfortable O
use O

( O
Note O
: O
This O
model O
is O
listed O
several O
times O
on O
Amazon O
at O
various O
prices O
, O
so O
be O
sure O
to O
shop O
for O
best O
price!)This O
review O

Ordered O
a O
new O
product O
. O

the O
sound O
is O
completely O
acceptable O
. O

I O
just O
got O
this O
bag O
in O

Way O
to O
many O
better O
options O
have O
appeared O
in O
the O
past O
3 O
+ O
years O
. O

For O
the O
price O
this O
is O
a O
very O
solid O
laptop O
. O

As O
per O
, O
I O
charged O
the O
battery O
overnight O
with O
the O
laptop O
off O
. O

I O
would O
suggest O
avoiding O
this O
supplier O
if O
you O
have O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
recharged O
the O
speaker O
with O
a O
5V~0 O
. O
85A O
AC O
wall O
charger O
overnight O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
fine O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
change O
is O
I O
would O
add O
a O
detachable O
shoulder O
strap O
. O

Its O
cheap O
chinsy O
plastic O
, O
and O
has O
terrible O
drivers O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
as O
a O
connection O
between O
an O
XBOX O
One O
console O
and O
the O
controller O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
such O
unit O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

I O
've O
NEVER O
had O
a O
dropped O
connection O
( O
hopefully O
this O
review O
wo O
n't O
jinx O
it O
! O
) O
. O

It O
could O
be O
infant O
mortality O
of O
the O
card O
but O
, O
be O
wary O
if O
you O
need O
reliability O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
how O
long O
the O
second O
lasts O
. O

I O
have O
an O
18 O
" O
laptop O
and O
it O
fit O
in O
the O
pocket O

That O
thing O
is O
still O
miles O
ahead O
of O
what O
HP O
is O
trying O
to O
do O
now O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
WiinRemote O
application O
worked O
properly O
. O

And O
I O
even O
took O
it O
off O
, O
just O
to O
test O
, O
no O
problem O
. O

The O
pack O
seems O
to O
fit O
my O
6D O
and O
G1X O
, O
lenses O
, O
filters O
, O
batteries O
etc O

I. O
e. O
, O
the O
ER6 O
are O
a O
lot O
more O
of O
an O
improvement O
over O
the O
Sony O
in O
- O
ear O
phones O
, O
or O
stock O
earbuds O
, O
than O
the O
Etymotic O
ER4 O
or O
Shure O
E4c/5c O
are O
over O
the O
ER6 O
's O
. O

I O
have O
done O
network O
audits O
of O
the O
available O
networks O
outside O
my O
place O
& O
the O
ones O
I O
know O
the O
password O
to O
connect O
at O
either O
1Mbps O
or O
54Mbps O
& O
it O
will O
fluctuate O
in O
between O
. O

And O
to O
put O
things O
in O
perspective O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
product O
because O
my O
keys O
to O
my O
Eclipse O
got O
misplaced O
.... O

I O
am O
now O
VERY O
happy O
with O
my O
setup O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
Satechi O
4-Port O
hub O
works O

It O
's O
held O
up O
well O
and O
it O
has O
extra O
storage O
. O

Everything O
is O
easy O
to O
get O
to O
, O
and O
my O
laptop O
-- O
a O
15 O
. O
5 O
inch O
model O
-- O
fits O
snugly O
, O
does O
n't O
jostle O
around O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
was O
easy O
to O
get O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
bag O
( O
I O
do O
n't O
yet O
have O
a O
tablet O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
speak O
to O
that O
) O
. O

but O
I O
can O
see O
that O
it O
might O
. O

I O
only O
intend O
to O
take O
one O
electronic O
device O
, O
the O
recharger O
for O
my O
camera O
batteries O
, O
on O
this O
trip O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
very O
user O
friendly O
. O

see O
if O
it O
is O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
things O
I O
've O
read O
about O
sending O
the O
computer O
to O
them O
show O
they O
frequently O
find O
something O
else O
wrong O
and O
end O
up O
charging O
you O
large O
amounts O
to O
repair O
the O
computer O
, O
many O
of O
them O
being O
things O
that O
were O
n't O
broken O
when O
you O
sent O
the O
computer O
in O
. O

Want O
to O
buy O
more O
colors O
. O

My O
thinking O
is O
that O
a O
cheap O
tool O
will O
usually O
do O
the O
job O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
also O
not O
very O
picky O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
audio O
. O

But O
that O
's O
all O
you O
get O
... O
a O
touch O
screen O
. O

One O
nice O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
detaches O
easily O
. O

This O
was O
a O
present O
for O
my O
Girlfriend O
's O
daughter O
. O

It O
's O
great O
quality O
and O
it O
saved O
me O
loads O
of O
bucks O
instead O
of O
ordering O
this O
direct O
from O
Acer O
. O

and O
it O
comes O
in O
handy O
all O
the O
time O
, O
like O
when O
I O
want O
to O
type O
things O
up O
while O
in O
bed O
or O
take O
a O
lightweight O
computer O
with O
me O
when O
I O
travel O
but O
do O
n't O
need O
it O
to O
do O
anything O
fancy O
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
* O
know O

In O
speed O
, O
it O
actually O
slowed O
me O
down O
. O

Enhanced O
software O
features O
includes:- O
More O
customization O

Has O
gotten O
me O
through O
two O
years O
so O
far O
, O
I O
expect O
it O
will O
get O
me O
through O
many O
more O
. O

I O
have O
bought O
several O
of O
these O
about O
9 O
months O
and O
they O
do O
charge O
at O
high O
speed O
. O

but O
much O
to O
my O
surprise O
it O
sounds O
just O
as O
good O
if O
not O
better O
than O
my O
on O
stage O
... O
this O
is O
a O
great O
unit O

In O
the O
laptop O
compartment O
, O
there O
is O
enough O
room O
left O
over O
for O
the O
power O
cords O
using O
the O
velcro O
divider O
. O

MegaPixel O
's O
as O
I O
imagine O
it O
but O
the O
audio O
is O
n't O
bad O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
computer O
having O
high O
expectations O
--- O
excellent O
battery O
life O
, O
optimus O
technology O
with O
a O
video O
card O
( O
512 O
mg O
) O
and O
an O
optical O
driver O
. O

It O
is O
soft O
and O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

It O
does O
come O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
bloatware O
, O
but O
( O
I O
think O
) O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
those O
that O
came O
with O
other O
laptops O
I O
've O
bought O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
very O
good O
, O
the O
price O
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
color O
is O
absolutely O
lovely O

So O
I O
switched O
it O
to O
the O
FireWire O
selection O
and O
immediately O
music O
poured O
loudly O
from O
these O
little O
gems O
. O

I O
found O
something O
similar O
but O
not O
as O
compact O
and O
it O
worked O
fine O
. O

A O

, O

Looks O
great O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
& O
included O
everything O
needed O
to O
get O
started O
( O
some O
do O
n't O
include O
the O
ac O
adapter O
! O
) O
. O

I O
like O
that O
this O
will O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
outlets O
and O
it O
provides O
a O
couple O
of O
USB O
charging O
ports O
. O

Boy O
do O
these O
little O
speakers O
pack O
a O
HUGE O
punch O
! O

That O
's O
a O
massive O
improvement O
. O

FYI O
: O
the O
repair O
requests O
form O
no O
longer O
works O
and O
you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
call O
or O
contact O
them O
in O
any O
way O
undoubtedly O
because O
their O
products O
suck O
and O
are O
all O
breaking O
. O

A O
Raspberry O
Pi O
plus O
this O
neat O
little O
device O
let O
me O
hook O
up O
to O
my O
older O
monitor O
, O
and O
everythingworks O
perfectly O
. O

In O
all O
three O
cases O
, O
the O
TV O
arrived O
on O
the O
scheduled O
date O
or O
earlier O
, O
with O
no O
damage O
. O

Which O
not O
to O
mention O
, O
was O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
neck O
. O

Oh O
well O
not O
our O
issue O
you O
need O
to O
contact O
FedEX O
" O
and O
gave O
me O
the O
opinion O
they O
could O
care O
less O
about O
it O
. O

The O
price O
is O
RIGHT O
! O

I O
've O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
Divx O
movies O
, O
youtube O
, O
Hulu O
full O
screen O
struggles O
a O
little O
, O
Mp3 O
's O
are O
no O
problem O
, O
and O
running O
a O
slingplayer O
app O
perfectly O
with O
no O
hiccups O
from O
a O
slingbox O
streaming O
a O
cable O
box O
9500 O
miles O
away O
and O
also O
netflix O
sd O
streaming O
works O
great O
. O

Well O
build O
. O

But O
I O
've O
learned O
to O
live O
with O
it O
and O
my O
back O
and O
neck O
thank O
me O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
1 O
. O
45 O
hours O
is O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
. O

If O
you O
need O
to O
carry O
an O
average O
about O
of O
items O
with O
your O
laptop O
, O
I O
suggest O
the O
top O
- O
loader O
( O
my O
person O
favorite O
) O
, O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
carrying O
little O
more O
than O
your O
computer O
itself O
, O
the O
slim O
design O
of O
the O
front O
- O
loader O
might O
be O
your O
best O
bet O
. O

After O
months O
of O
troubleshooting O
and O
talking O
to O
others O
with O
the O
same O
phone O
, O
I O
have O
traced O
the O
problem O
to O
the O
Belkin O
USB O
ports O
. O

Anyway O
, O
the O
MSI O
heads O
back O
for O
repair O
early O
next O
week O
( O
early O
February O
) O
and O
I O
'll O
note O
what O
the O
resolution O
was O
after O
it O
comes O
back O
. O

A O
great O
way O
to O
give O
an O
11 O
years O
old O

more O
life O
and O
make O
it O
work O

is O

This O
is O
B. O

As O
of O

it O

still O
not O

Once O

Unlike O
some O
of O
the O
covers O
I O
've O
used O
I O
like O
the O
way O
this O
one O
lets O
you O
lay O
it O
down O

tilted O

you O

was O
a O
reason O
I O
always O
built O
my O

the O

I O
have O

in O

Southern O

under O

with O
good O

About O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
's O
good O
about O
this O
is O
the O
aesthetic O
design O
. O

For O
the O
third O

the O

failed O

although O
we O

the O

would O
hold O

it O

what O

more O
can O
a O
man O
possibly O
ask O
? O

It O

I O
was O
really O
on O
the O
fence O
about O
buying O
this O
given O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
long O
this O
device O
will O
last O

The O
cords O
that O
came O
worked O
flawlessly O
to O
get O
the O
information O
of O
a O
drive O
I O
lost O
during O
a O
recent O
house O
fire O
. O

I O
needed O
this O
because O
the O
original O
charger O
that O
came O
with O
my O
HP O
laptop O
had O
a O
wire O
break O
and O
was O
no O
longer O
charging O
my O
laptop O
unless O
I O
held O
the O
cable O
in O
a O
specific O
position O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
expect O
more O
. O

Its O
great O
my O
brothers O
can O
see O
my O
family O
when O
we O
chat O
, O
and O
that O
rocks O

I O
use O
the O
computer O
mostly O
for O
web O
page O
editing O
, O
picture O
editing O
and O
entertainment O
purposes O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
carrying O
it O
most O
of O

It O

a O
fairly O
thin O

When O
I O

the O
first O
thing O
I O
noticed O
is O
the O
differences O
between O
it O
and O
the O
Original O

Price O
was O
great O
, O
shipping O
was O

I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
prefer O
this O

the O

a O

This O
extra O
3/4 O

is O
really O
nice O
to O
have O

The O
hardware O
and O
included O

do O
work O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

The O
usual O
wait O
time O
on O
hold O
is O
over O
15 O
minutes O
, O
and O
this O
is O
AFTER O
the O
offshore O

up O
the O

and O
makes O
some O
time O
- O
wasting O
, O
unneeded O
and O
annoying O

Furthermore O
, O
as O
I O
had O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
the O

can O
collapse O

My O
only O
criticism O
of O
the O
cooler O
is O
the O
fan O
noise O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
noticeable O
than O
I O
expected O

Great O
product O

I O
can O
get O
it O
to O
a O
point O
where O
there O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
one O
inch O
band O
on O
the O
top O
and O
bottom O
of O
the O

that O
looks O
like O

If O
your O

has O
a O

it O
will O
work O
for O
you O
as O
well O
. O

but O
then O
again O
that O
's O
why O
people O
choose O
this O
over O
ipod O
touch O
right O
? O
for O
flash O
? O

The O
lid O
slid O
on O
where O
the O
old O
lid O
was O
... O

Even O
then O
, O
the O
edges O
were O
difficult O
to O
line O
up O
properly O
. O

On O
Windows O
, O
I O
would O
expect O
about O
an O
hour O
less O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
stored O
on O
the O
outside O
wall O
of O
the O
case O
with O
just O
one O
layer O
of O
padding O
, O
which O
does O
n't O
give O
as O
much O
protection O
as O
it O
could O
if O
the O
big O
, O
padded O
flaps O
were O
attached O
to O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
case O
. O

I O
love O
the O
felt O
lined O
quick O
access O
pocket O
that O
was O
lacking O
on O
my O
Targus O
. O

It O
's O
turned O
a O
sleek O
piece O
of O
engineering O
design O
into O
something O
dreadful O
. O

The O
micro O

seems O
to O
be O
a O
tighter O

every O

The O

, O
in O

Fantastic O
price O
for O
an O
item O
that O
looks O
and O
feels O
like O
a O
brand O
- O
new O
- O
never O
- O
been O
- O
used O
unit O
. O

The O
lock O
itself O
felt O
loose O
and O
had O
a O
rubber O
gasket O
that O
did O
n't O
fit O
and O
fell O
out O
. O

Anyone O
know O
of O
a O
7 O
inch O
case O
just O
like O
this O
one O
with O
carry O
handles O
? O

It O
allows O
m O
e O
to O
control O
transmit O
power O
as O
well O
as O
other O
parameters O
. O

Fits O
almost O
perfectly O
( O
98 O

) O
and O
the O
slightly O
shorter O

actually O
fixed O

warped O
a O
bit O
after O
7 O

1/2 O
years O
of O
service O
! O
) O

I O
just O
needed O
something O
small O
that O
can O
run O
Windows O
. O

My O
fix O
for O
this O
was O
simple O
. O

I O
spent O
all O
of O
this O
money O
on O
this O
laptop O
to O
find O
out O
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
crap O
since O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

i O
really O
like O
it O

This O
computer O
is O
for O
performance O
group O
so O
it O
gets O
pretty O
banged O
around O
and O
this O
added O
cover O
makes O
me O
feel O
better O
about O
it O
's O
protection O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
, O
the O
power O
cord O
is O
LONG O
, O
not O
some O
cheap O
2 O
' O
cord O
as O
others O
are O
. O

The O
LCD O
protector O
was O
fast O
and O
easy O
. O

Add O
says O
it O
works O
on O
android O
. O

After O
a O
couple O
weeks O
the O
suction O
cups O
began O
to O
give O
out O
. O

The O
15 O
inch O
Vizio O
is O
perhaps O
the O
closest O
competition O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
even O
have O
an O
SD O
card O
slot O
to O
view O
pics O
from O
your O
camera O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
drive O
does O
n't O
seem O
eligible O
for O
ReadyBoost O
in O
Windows O
7 O
, O
but O
it O
's O
certainly O
worth O
the O
price O
for O
16 O
gb O
of O
pure O
USB O
Mass O
Storage O
. O

Originally O
, O
I O
avoided O
the O
MacBook O
Airs O
because O
I O
felt O
they O
were O
underpowered O
, O
but O
this O
latest O
version O
remedies O
most O
of O
those O
concerns O
. O

You O
will O
invest O
a O
lot O
of O
quality O
time O
getting O
Windows O
7 O
up O
to O
date.- O

I O
bought O
this O
one O

I O
am O
curious O
to O
see O
where O
" O
Cloud O
Computing O
" O
goes O
, O
and O
it O
does O
a O
good O
job O
at O
surfing O
the O
web O
, O
email O
, O
and O
chat O
, O
which O
is O
what O
most O
people O
use O
their O
computer O
's O
for O
, O
anyway O
. O

A O
great O
advantage O
is O
detachable O
battery O
pack O
, O
something O
not O
very O
common O
in O
ultrabooks O
. O

I O
posted O
a O
long O
review O
of O
the O
current O
crop O
of O
DV6 O
- O
21xx O
series O
of O
notebooks O
here O
: O

The O
extra O
keys O
on O
the O
side O
are O
nice O
for O
quickly O
opening O
your O
internet O
browser O
, O
printing O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
although O
they O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
for O
the O
placement O
of O
your O
hands O
while O
typing O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
this O
speaker O
if O
you O
want O
something O
simple O

I O
was O
n't O
sure O
that O
I O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
that O
only O
interfaced O
the O
web O
, O
with O
no O
ability O
to O
customize O
or O
install O
normal O
software O
. O

I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
3 O
out O
of O
5 O
for O
operational O
performance O
. O

It O
has O
a O
nice O
range O
too O
, O
to O
enable O
you O
to O
move O
around O
, O
without O
losing O
contact O
. O

I O
have O
three O
so O
far O
, O
make O
's O
a O
good O
gifts O
for O
friends O
. O

Just O
purchased O
this O
bag O
after O
a O
year O
of O
coveting O
it O
. O

It O
's O
just O
fraught O
with O
a O
few O
small O
things O
that O
make O
it O
obvious O
where O
the O
corners O
were O
cut O
-- O
namely O
, O
the O
nuances O
of O
the O
design O
, O
and O
the O
testing O
/ O
QA O
. O

Search O
the O
Internet O
for O
Samsung O
" O
distorted O
sound O
" O
and O
" O
robotic O
audio O
" O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
problem O
. O

It O
's O
a O
battery O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
the O
screen O
of O
my O
mac O
but O
its O
not O
easy O
put O
them O

Overall O
I O
really O
like O
this O
bag O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
messenger O
bag O
that O
is O
totally O
utilitarian O
and O
looks O
cool O
too O
. O
^_^ O

I O
've O
only O
used O
this O
one O
a O
few O
of O
times O
, O
but O
the O
results O
were O
decent O
enough O
. O

I O
strongly O
suggest O
using O
the O
power O
source O
included O
, O
as O
a O
usb O
port O
alone O
can O
only O
provide O
~500mA O
, O
whereas O
the O
power O
source O
is O
rated O
for O
~2000mA. O

The O
top O
loading O
suspension O
system O
make O
retrieving O
and O
storing O
the O
camera O
easy O
, O
quick O
, O
and O
secure O
. O

right O
it O
can O
be O
frustrating O
trying O
to O
feel O
for O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
pad O
. O

Speakers O
are O
terrible O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
it O
's O
really O
good O
for O
general O
gestures O
( O
ie O
. O
swiping O
screens O
etc O
) O
but O
not O
good O
for O
fine O
movement O
like O
say O
with O
an O
iPad O
. O

This O
could O
be O
any O
external O
drive O
types O
, O
printers O
, O
speaker O
systems O
and O
external O
displays O
that O
you O
wish O
to O
use O
. O

For O
the O
price O
of O
the O
best O
model O
, O
you O
could O
buy O
an O
ultrabook O
with O
similar O
specs O
( O
around O
$ O
1000 O
) O
, O
a O
much O
more O
powerful O
desktop O
with O
dual O
24 O
in O
monitors O
( O
around O
$ O
1000+$300 O
) O
, O
and O
a O
tablet O
( O
around O
$ O
500 O
) O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
a O
great O
screen O
, O
runs O
fast O
and O
therefore O
should O
be O
great O
for O
video O
editing O
on O
the O
road O
, O
but O
I O
use O
the O
10 O
key O
portion O
of O
a O
keyboard O
when O
video O
editing O
, O
and O
this O
laptop O
does O
not O
have O
one O
. O

There O
are O
no O
panels O
to O
manually O
install O
or O
set O
hardware O
that O
does O
not O
mount O
automatically O
, O
unless O
it O
registers O
in O
the O
audio O
mixer O
( O
which O
it O
did O
not O
) O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
very O
nice O
while O
in O
hand O
, O
and O
hooks O
up O
via O
HDMI O
to O
present O
dazzling O
visual O
displays O
on O
monitors O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
detailed O
review O
as O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
actual O
runtime O
for O
you O
. O

I O
never O
had O
this O
issue O
with O
the O
app O
before O
, O
so O

if O
you O
seen O
one O
you O
know O
its O
a O
tank O
and O
its O
heavy O
laptop O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
this O
is O
a O
decent O
device O
. O

A O
slightly O
padded O
rear O
compartment O
with O
a O
velcro O
latch O
houses O
your O
laptop O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
amazing O
. O

I O
have O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
using O
OS O
X O
10 O
. O
5 O
. O
6 O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
using O
Time O
Machine O
( O
supplied O
software O
) O
with O
Apple O
's O
Time O
Capsule O
( O
wireless O
router O
and O
backup O
system O
) O
to O
wirelessly O
backup O
my O
laptop O
automatically O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
know O
why O
MS O
and O
other O
brand O
names O
sell O
the O
exact O
same O
product O
at O
four O
times O
the O
price O
. O

so O
I O
do O
not O
have O
to O
undock O
to O
sync O
with O
my O
PC O
. O

Great O
warranty O
, O
came O
with O
one O
free O
year O
of O
accidental O
damage O
protection O
. O

The O
NotePal O
X O
- O
Slim O
appears O
to O
be O
well O
constructed O
, O
and O
it O
's O
definitely O
meeting O
my O
expectations O
for O
a O
cooling O
pad O
. O

If O
they O
last O
over O
time O
they O
will O
be O
worth O
the O
price O
which O
was O
n't O
that O
much O
. O

You O
might O
want O
to O
get O
some O
of O
the O
6-foot O
Apple O
charger O
cables O
, O
then O
you O
can O
use O
the O
device O
while O
it O
is O
charging O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
speaker O
setup O
! O

but O
it O
is O
secure O
and O
wo O
n't O
move O
around O
while O
in O
transit O
. O

Anyways O
i O
signed O
it O
and O
prayed O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
use O
mine O
for O
both O
travel O
( O
once O
I O
can O
travel O
again O
) O
and O
at O
school O
. O

Nice O
look O

nice O

, O
take O
some O
getting O
used O

smaller O
than O
what O

It O

I O
'm O
super O
happy O
with O
this O
buy O
. O

I O
calibrated O
the O
lcd O
, O
but O
the O
blue O
tint O
kept O
coming O
back O
. O

Wow O
, O
I O
was O
impressed O
. O

However O
, O
the O
charging O
will O
have O
to O
be O
done O
with O
the O
flap O
down O
to O
charge O
it O
, O
which O
to O
me O
, O
is O
not O
a O
big O
issue O
, O
I O
charge O
my O
devices O
at O
night O
while O
I O
am O
asleep O
. O

I O
plug O
this O
thing O
in O
, O
and O
everything O
sounds O
much O
better O
and O
even O
louder O
. O

I O
also O
thread O
my O
head O
phones O
and O
ethernet O
cables O
through O
the O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
have O
whatever O
it O
is O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
cool O
sitting O
direcly O
on O
these O

It O
smells O
strongly O
of O
a O
mixture O
of O
turpentine O
and O
some O
other O
toxic O
chemical O

I O
did O

want O
in O

and O
then O
I O
sold O

Nothing O
missed O
! O

, O
I O
was O
expecting O
it O
to O
be O
light O
as O
a O
feather O
, O
have O
no O
weight O
and O
feel O
cheap O
, O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
, O
this O
thing O
feels O
quality O
and O
to O
me O
that O
means O
alot O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
ACER O
laptop O
and O
both O
have O
and O
are O
giving O
me O
good O
service O
. O

and O
it O
worked O
great O
so O
far O
. O

Clone O
takes O
me O
about O
6 O
hours O
on O
a O
500 O
gb O
drive O
with O
300 O
gb O
of O
data O
. O

Several O
reboots O
got O
it O
back O
up O
and O
running O
, O
so O
I O
was O
nervous O
but O
decided O
not O
to O
sweat O
it O
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
RAM O
( O
memory O
operations O
per O
second O
) O
, O
the O
Graphics O
( O
desktop O
performance O
for O
Windows O
Aero O
) O
, O
and O
the O
gaming O
graphics O
( O
3D O
business O
and O
gaming O
graphics O
performance O
) O
. O

Hope O
it O
dissipates O
. O

The O
thumb O
buttons O
are O
extremely O
poorly O
placed O
, O
and O
do O
not O
have O
a O
very O
user O
friendly O
actuation O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
did O
n't O
spend O
much O
$ O
on O
it O
. O

The O
resulting O
bulge O
is O
so O
subtle O
it O
does O
n't O
cause O
any O
problem O
when O
typing O
on O
a O
table O
or O
even O
when O
placing O
the O
GS4 O
on O
the O
charging O
pad O
. O

It O
also O
has O
the O
2-speed O
switch O
on O
the O
side O
for O
either O
High O
or O
Low O
speed O
operations O
. O

I O
choose O
white O
because O
had O
enough O
black O
. O

Touchscreen O
response O
is O
good O
but O
sometimes O
can O
over O
compensate O
. O

This O
one O
after O
installation O
of O
software O
from O
CD O
and O
plugging O
in O
the O
USB O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

While O
I O
liked O
the O
design O
and O
portability O
of O
some O
of O
those O
speakers O
, O
it O
bugged O
me O
that O
they O
all O
featured O
docks O
for O
the O
various O
iPod O
models O
. O

Each O
device O
detected O
and O
installed O
, O
and O
once O
that O
was O
finished O
the O
computer O
asked O
for O
a O
reboot O
which O
completed O
the O
installation O
. O

Would O
probably O
be O
the O
perfect O
laptop O
at O
this O
price O
point O
. O

There O
's O
also O
Microsoft O
Works O
and O
a O
trial O
version O
of O
Norton O
Security O
and O
Microsoft O
Office O
. O

So O
far O
I O
think O
this O
case O
is O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
my O
Acer O
Chromebook O
, O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
and O
provides O
the O
protection O
I O
wanted O
for O
the O
unit O
. O

It O
's O
a O
five O
- O
button O
mouse O
with O
probably O
the O
best O
scroll O
wheel O
available O
on O
a O
mouse O
. O

Good O
construction O
. O

Great O
for O
those O
long O
trips O
in O
the O
car O
. O

I O
understand O
now O
that O
is O
to O
protect O
a O
glass O
screen O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O

which O
is O
a O
problem O
i O
had O
with O
the O
cables O
to O
go O
splitter O
... O

I O
was O
mislead O
by O
all O
the O
good O
comments O
. O

We O
picked O
up O
some O
nice O
looking O
, O
shoeboxed O
size O
cloth O
covered O
boxes O
locally O
and O
it O
's O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O
the O
ProSleeve O
's O
and O
the O
Storage O
Guides O
. O

It O
supplies O
all O
the O
light O
this O
thing O
needs O
! O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
all O
the O
tools O
needed O
, O
including O
the O
plastic O
needed O
to O
unplug O
the O
delicate O
cables O
. O

A O
little O
floppy O
around O
the O
edges O
, O
and O
it O
took O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
to O
get O
used O
to O
having O
to O
be O
sort O
of O
careful O
when O
picking O
it O
up O
, O
but O
I O
like O
it O
now O
. O

after O
having O
previously O
been O
burned O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
buying O
cheap O
, O
knock O
- O
off O
cables O
on O
Amazon O
. O

There O
are O
no O
equivalent O
programs O
for O
what O
I O
am O
doing O
on O
Mac O
and O
the O
requirements O

The O
aluminum O
is O
n't O
a O
glossy O
shiny O
finish O
but O
more O
of O
a O
matte O
finish O
. O

This O
is O
an O
ideal O
little O
desk O
stereo O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
, O
and O
my O
friend O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

I O
imagine O
this O
one O
will O
last O
a O
good O
long O
time O
. O

of O
the O
case O
it O
was O
killing O
my O
back O
/ O
shoulder O
/ O
neck O
. O

and O
I O
find O
it O
comes O
off O
very O
easily O
. O

so O
I O
can O
watch O
TV O
and O
wear O
headphones O
while O
I O
run O
. O

so O
I O
run O
the O
Dell O
Diagnostic O
software O
to O
find O
the O
root O
cause O
, O
and O
to O
my O
surprise O
the O
new O
fan O
did O
n't O
pass O
the O
test O
it O
gave O
me O
the O
error O
code O
3700:011B O
, O
which O
means O
FAN O
FAILURE O
, O
I O
could O
not O
believe O
they O
sent O
me O
a O
bad O
fan O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
the O
old O
fan O
that O
I O
was O
replacing O
and O
this O
one O
passed O
the O
diagnostic O
test O
without O
a O
problem O
, O
so O
I O
ended O
up O
cleaning O
my O
old O
fan O
and O
using O
it O
again O

It O
is O
on O
the O
side O
and O
can O
be O
highly O
inconvenient O
. O

It O
looks O
more O
like O
the O
deluxe O
high O
end O
expensive O
version O
to O
me O
. O

but O
it O
also O
has O
very O
comfortable O
handles O

This O
cable O
-- O
mouse O
freezes O
and O
have O
to O
reboot O
. O

I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
AC O
adapter O
. O

But O
it O
's O
also O
very O
light O
. O

In O
Mediabridge O
's O
defense O
they O
did O
reach O
out O
to O
me O
to O
ask O
how O
my O
purchase O
was O
I O
have O
n't O
gotten O
back O
to O
them O
yet O
, O
if O
they O
replace O
the O
item O
with O
little O
trouble O
I O
'll O
increase O
the O
stars O
somewhat O
but O
for O
right O
now O
I O
can O
not O
recommend O
, O
TB O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
to O
all O
. O

I O
did O
a O
battery O
reset O
, O
still O
no O
luck O
. O

Loud O
enough O
to O
share O
your O
music O
or O
audio O
- O
books O
with O
those O
around O
you O
. O

It O
turns O
it O
to O
sleep O
mode O
or O
wake O
mode O
automatically O
. O

It O
's O
brilliant O
and O
sharp O
. O

Hopefully O
, O
in O
the O
not O
- O
too O
- O
distant O
future O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
plop O
a O
3D O
disk O
in O
the O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
3D O
drive O
, O
take O
out O
our O
3D O
glasses O
( O
with O
magnified O
lenses O
) O
and O
watch O
3D O
movies O
on O
a O
laptop O
; O
those O
days O
, O
however O
, O
are O
still O
in O
the O
future O
( O
2 O
- O
3 O
years O
) O
. O

The O
space O
bar O
is O
difficult O
to O
hit O
, O
which O
slows O
you O
down O
, O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
after O
a O
while O
. O

We O
both O
own O
Toshiba O
laptops O
and O
the O
touchpads O
there O
work O
smoothly O
without O
a O
glitch O
. O

Exterior O
Finish O
- O
I O
had O
to O
rule O
out O
the O
Inspiron O

because O
of O
the O
fingerprint O
magnet O
black O
shiny O
finish O
that O
is O
all O
the O
( O
dumb O
) O
rage O
in O
electronics O
these O

Non O
of O
the O
product O
info O
had O
mentioned O
this O
feature O
prior O
to O
my O
purchase O
, O
so O
this O
was O
just O
a O
great O
little O
bonus O
which O
I O
find O
to O
be O
very O
useful O
. O

So O
far O
no O
complaints O
from O
my O
niece O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sure O
winner O
- O
lightweight O
, O
very O

and O
even O
has O

There O

if O
not O
real O
problems O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
VGA O
cable O
pictured O
is O
n't O
what O
you O
get O
in O
the O
box O
. O

This O
product O
is O
designed O
to O
hold O
your O
computer O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
your O
iPad O
, O
and O
your O
iPhone O
, O
and O
additional O
personal O
flotsam O
and O
jetsam O
( O
chargers O
, O
headphones O
, O
etc.).In O
other O
words O
, O
it O
is O
big O
. O

does O
what O
it O
should O
, O
nice O
crisp O
video O
and O
the O
audio O
is O
good O
as O
well O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
it O
to O
browse O
internet O
and O
to O
write O
blogs O
in O
Russian O
. O

Both O
cracked O
in O
the O
rear O
corners O
of O
the O
bottom O
cover O
after O
a O
couple O
months O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
this O
bag O
is O
my O
fave O
on O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
shove O
all O
of O
these O
things O
into O
the O
one O
supplemental O
opening O
. O

It O
's O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
a O
radio O
that O
hangs O
in O
the O
shower O
itself O
, O
and O
the O
option O
of O
playing O
your O
own O
music O
from O
flash O
drives O
/ O
cards O
is O
hard O
to O
pass O
up O
. O

I O
could O
cram O
it O
in O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
fit O
my O
book O
and O
8 O
. O

While O
these O
are O
listed O
as O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
, O
they O
certainly O
did O
n't O
act O
the O
part O
. O

Strangely O
, O
Ubuntu O
was O
also O
able O
to O
resurrect O
the O
" O
broken O
" O
internal O
WiFi O
NIC O
on O
the O
laptop O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
the O
USB O
stick O
any O
more O
. O

Bought O
to O
emulate O
Wii O
- O
mote O
on O
PC O
. O

" O
I O
do O
nt O
normally O
use O
auto O
- O
correct O

With O
that O
being O
said O
, O
the O
cord O
is O
a O
bit O
shorter O
than O
I O
would O
like O
. O

Without O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
warped O
disc O
and O
no O
ability O
to O
obtain O
Nero O
8 O
software O
, O
this O
would O
receive O
a O
3-star O
rating O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
this O
pad O
. O

OLD O
REVIEW O
of O
original O
product O
. O

This O
Amp O
seems O
reasonably O
priced O
and O
i O
wanted O
a O
desktop O
unit O
, O
did O
not O
need O
tht O
DAC O

So O
, O
yes O
, O
it O
will O
do O
the O
job O
but O
be O
aware O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
limitations O
. O

I O
used O
my O
Sony O
Vaio O
for O
long O
time O
and O
this O
replacement O
battery O
does O
the O
job O
. O

The O
external O
pockets O
are O
all O
good O
sized O
and O
close O
pretty O
securely O
with O
buttons O
. O

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
improvements O
and O
the O
styling O
is O
nice O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
headphone O
specifically O
to O
use O
with O
Dragon O
Naturally O
Speaking O
10 O
, O
which O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
with O
it O
. O

5lbs O
you O
get O
superdrive O
, O
changeable O
battery O
, O
up O
to O
4gigs O
of O
ram O
, O
bigger O
hard O
drive O
, O
and O
it O
fells O
almost O
as O
small O
as O
the O
macbook O
air O
. O

The O
use O
of O
it O
is O
good O
, O
screen O
very O
nice O
. O

I O
was O
using O
only O
a O
three O
- O
prong O
grounded O
plug O
from O
the O
US O
. O

I O
'd O
buy O
it O
again O
and O
recommend O
it O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Visit O
Lenovo O
, O
Asus O
, O
HP O
, O
Dell O
, O
Toshiba O
websites O
and O
research O
their O
latest O
budget O
model O
lines O
as O
those O
models O
will O
have O
the O
must O
updates O
CPUs O
in O
them O
. O

Would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
that O
likes O
to O
run O
different O
operating O
systems O
. O

Until O
someone O
invents O
the O
self O
cleaning O
, O
vaporizing O
trackball O
.... O
they O
should O
remain O
removable O
. O

I O
had O
mentioned O
there O
was O
a O
scratch O
on O
the O
case O

I O
was O
wary O
of O
the O
glossy O
screen O
from O
the O
getgo O
, O
because O
I O
MUCH O
MUCh O
prefer O
matte O
screens O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
battery O
. O

It O
replaced O
a O
Toshiba O
that O
went O
thru O
3 O
hard O
drives O
and O
died O
after O
2 O
years O
. O

The O
cover O
folds O
up O
to O
be O
used O
as O
a O
stand O
and O
is O
very O
sturdy O
( O
does O
n't O
unfurl O
while O
being O
used O
, O
even O
with O
some O
nasty O
turbulence O
on O
the O
last O
flight O
) O
. O

Do O
n't O
try O
using O
it O
while O
eating O
some O
left O
over O
fried O
chicken O
! O

When O
I O
ordered O
a O
new O
Mac O
laptop O
one O
of O
the O
reviews O
said O
the O
silver O
finish O
on O
it O
was O
easily O
scratched O
and O
mentioned O
getting O
a O
cover O
. O

I O
had O
aTargus O

Notebook O
Chill O
PadI O
used O
. O

9 O
" O
tablet O
, O
which O
charges O
very O
slowly O
. O

It O
takes O
very O
little O
space O
on O
the O
table O
and O
looks O
great O
on O
my O
mac O
! O

It O
works O
perfectly O
and O
passed O

I O
was O
surprised O
with O
everything O
that O
it O
came O
with O
. O

I O
had O
a O
Canon O
S95 O
and O
put O
CHDK O
on O
it O
, O
which O
while O
a O
bit O
rough O
around O
the O
edges O
, O
provided O
me O
with O
an O
endlessly O
programmable O
intervalometer O
. O

The O
front O
pocket O
lets O
me O
store O
some O
random O
pens O
, O
styluses O
, O
and O
a O
small O
notebook O
. O

I O
ordered O
it O
on O
a O
Friday O
afternoon O
. O

The O
leg O
stand O
for O
the O
case O
is O
a O
added O
bonus O
. O

The O
D525 O
's O
embedded O
memory O
controller O
limits O
usable O
RAM O
to O
2 O
. O
8 O
GB O
, O
meaning O
that O
it O
is O
probably O
NOT O
advisable O
to O
purchase O
the O
4 O
GB O
version O
of O
the O
1215N. O

For O
the O
price O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
. O

This O
mouse O
will O
blind O
you O
at O
night O
. O

The O
distance O
is O
just O
barely O
long O
enough O
but O
I O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
close O
when O
I O
ordered O
it O
. O

friends O
of O
mine O
have O
this O
, O
and O
I O
got O
the O
chance O
to O
use O
it O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
came O
away O
impressed O
. O

But O
I O
think O
it O
actually O
helps O
stabilize O
it O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
. O

If O
not O
go O
spend O
59 O
. O
95 O
and O
get O
the O
shaft O
. O

However O
, O
if O
the O
magnet O
( O
that O
keeps O
it O
shut O
) O
touches O
your O
tablet O
's O
front O
, O
it O
will O
turn O
the O
tablet O
off O
and O
has O
possible O
adverse O
affects O
if O
done O
continuously O
. O

I O
like O
the O
extra O
lip O
that O
goes O
around O
it O
although O
it O
does O
increase O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

You O
can O
add O
an O
handle O
if O
you O
want O
. O

The O
mouse O
itself O
is O
3 O
3/4 O
inches O
long O
, O
with O
contoured O
, O
rubberized O
sides O
for O
a O
comfortable O
grip O
. O

Comes O
complete O
with O
a O
short O
USB O
extension O
cable O
and O
the O
2 O
GB O
SD O
card O
-- O
both O
nice O
bonuses O
on O
top O
of O
a O
useful O
reader O
. O

I O
tried O
this O
on O
my O
brother O
's O
PC O
and O
it O
still O
does O
not O
really O
receive O
any O
signal O
, O
however O
an O
additional O
light O
lit O
up O
this O
time O
on O
the O
PC O
. O

I O
multitasked O
with O
a O
live O
audio O
stream O
, O
a O
program O
download O
, O
and O
a O
few O
open O
programs O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
notice O
much O
slowdown O
. O

I O
downloaded O
all O
the O
programs O
we O
like O
to O
use O
Firefox O
, O
CCleaner O
, O
Microsoft O
Security O
Essentials O
and O
got O
rid O
of O
Norton O
security O
which O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
at O
all O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
notebook O
case O
, O
good O
material O
& O
construction O
. O

Many O
thanks O
to O
AnkerDirect O
for O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
right O
. O

Here O
is O
how O
to O
use O
the O
speaker O
and O
controls O
: O
Pair O
your O
BT O
audio O
to O
it O
. O

This O
case O
works O
great O
for O
it O
. O

But O
seeing O
a O
SoundLink O
at O
the O
Apple O
store O
, O
I O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
size O
and O
quality O
. O

It O
works O
great O
! O

It O
appears O
that O
there O
has O
not O
been O
a O
new O
customer O
review O
of O
the O
11 O
. O

It O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
am O
using O
Kanex O
dongles O
for O
both O
the O
VGA O
and O
HDMI O
. O

I O
love O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
while O
I O
shower O
and O
get O
ready O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
this O
is O
my O
new O
go O
- O
to O
speaker O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
if O
you O
allow O
your O
computer O
to O
run O
a O
battery O
to O
calculate O
how O
long O
it O
takes O
to O
shutdown O
your O
computer O
properly O
. O

( O
I O
'd O
also O
like O
an O
alternative O
to O
Apple O
's O
problematic O
AC O
adapters O
. O
) O

The O
wireless O
connected O
easily O
with O
my O
home O
network O
. O

I O
move O
around O
with O
my O
laptop O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
've O
had O
it O
a O
month O
and O
traveled O
in O
the O
US O
and O
Canada O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

It O
's O
more O
of O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
than O
a O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
fine O
for O
me O
because O
I O
wanted O
a O
slender O
bag O
for O
ease O
of O
carrying O
on O
public O
transit O
. O

Definitely O
a O
good O
( O
and O
nice O
looking O
) O
unit O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Only O
downfall O
of O
this O
is O
that O
if O
you O
download O
low O
quality O
music O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
how O
bad O
anything O
less O
than O
192 O
K O
bit O
rate O
really O
is O
..... O

yes O
, O
the O
box O
itself O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
lot O
longer O
.... O
and O
flatter O
... O
than O
expected O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
people O
have O
complained O
about O
the O
build O
quality O
on O
these O
- O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
anything O
that O
even O
hints O
at O
poor O
quality O
with O
this O
model O
. O

Precise O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

The O
optical O
drive O
sounds O
, O
at O
times O
, O
like O
the O
Enterprise O
spinning O
up O
on O
the O
original O
Star O
Trek O
. O

Durable O
and O
affordable O
. O

While O
this O
product O
is O
clunky O
, O
it O
works O
as O
described O
and O
provided O
much O
needed O
temporary O
power O
during O
outage O
over O
several O
days O
. O

HDMI O
for O
video O
is O
pretty O
standard O
and O
an O
SSD O
slot O
for O
transfering O
pictures O
is O
also O
welcomed O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
device O
to O
pair O
with O
a O
HTPC O
for O
casual O
couch O
web O
/ O
channel O
surfing O
. O

It O
was O
crap O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
taking O
it O
back O
and O
picking O
up O
a O
Logitech O
( O
coincidently O
) O
wireless O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
. O

I O
am O
very O
sorry O
about O
recommending O
that O
plastic O
sleeve O
. O

I O
further O
tested O
it O
by O
plugging O
in O
all O
manner O
of O
USB O
devices O
. O

Using O
these O
will O
help O
you O
gain O
experience O
with O
the O
tablet O
and O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
pen O
. O

These O
are O
not O
on O
the O
screen O
but O
in O
the O
black O
area O
bordering O
the O
screen O
. O

Wow O
, O
the O
bump O
in O
speed O
is O
incredible O
. O

I O
've O
played O
some O
movies O
in O
1080p O
off O
the O
hard O
drive O
and O
they O
all O
play O
fine O
with O
the O
onboard O
Intel O
HD O
Graphics O
4400 O
. O

It O
starts O
zooming O
in O
without O
you O
touching O
any O
control O
. O

I O
'm O
writing O
the O
review O
from O
this O
laptop O
. O

They O
do O
not O
require O
plugging O
in O
, O
so O
one O
less O
item O
in O
the O
power O
strip O
, O
and O
I O
reclaimed O
some O
desktop O
space O
, O
as O
they O
mounted O
nicely O
behind O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
got O
turned O
on O
to O
this O
handy O
- O
dandy O
little O
thing O
when O
my O
wife O
bought O
one O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
. O

I O
can O
only O
tighten O
the O
straps O
about O
an O
inch O
or O

For O
what O
it O
is O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
system O
, O
but O
will O
likely O
appeal O
to O
those O
who O
want O
a O
two O
speaker O

system O
with O
limited O

and O
an O
industrial O
style O
. O

It O
worked O
well O
with O
my O

and O
allowed O
me O
an O
extra O
3 O
ports O
than O
I O
would O
have O

. O

The O

I O
have O
a O
wireless O
4 O
G O
card O
which O
worked O
perfectly O
and O
this O
laptop O
worked O
perfectly O
on O
wired O

I O
am O
hoping O
that O
it O
will O
not O
come O
off O
later O
but O
we O
will O
see O
. O

I O
sure O
wo O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
at O
regular O
prices O
. O

These O
speakers O
sound O
very O
good O
: O
well O
balanced O
from O
bass O
to O
treble O
, O
including O
very O
clear O
and O
warm O
mid O

. O

I O
'd O
rate O
it O
4 O
. O
5 O
stars O
if O
possible O
. O

Bass O
is O
enough O
, O
and O
overall O
sound O
is O
cool O
i O
can O
get O
all O

I O
've O
had O
mediabridge O
before O
and O
never O

: O
I O
wish O
it O
came O

a O
rain O

and O
, O
I O
wish O
the O
telescope O

locked O
in O

but O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
very O
secure O
. O

No O

the O

shows O

and O
every O

I O
just O
wish O
the O
design O
was O
n't O
so O
quirky O
. O

However O
, O
for O
this O
price O
it O
is O
acceptable O
. O

It O
took O
a O
little O
bit O
to O
install O
the O
software O
on O
Windows O
7 O
, O
but O
nonetheless O
it O
worked O
. O

I O

time O
, O

that O
is O
wonderful O
. O

The O

an O
Athlon O

I O
was O
very O
concerned O
that O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
handle O
the O

at O
all O
. O

This O
works O
perfectly O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
is O
properly O
grounded O
. O

No O
ability O
to O
change O
the O
angle O
that O
it O
is O
held O
at O
. O

The O
display O
is O
wonderful O
, O
very O
sharp O
. O

Rather O
than O
go O
to O
a O
big O
box O
store O
and O
try O
to O
find O
a O
cap O
that O
fit O
, O
I O
found O
these O
caps O
online O
that O
arrived O
quickly O
. O

Given O
my O
heavy O
use O
, O
I O
typically O
get O
about O
4 O
. O
5 O
to O
5 O
hours O
battery O

which O
is O
more O
than O
enough O

nothing O
happened O
... O

It O
runs O
smoother O
and O
has O
more O
features O
. O

We O
used O
this O
on O
trip O
to O
Africa O
, O
where O
many O
lodgings O
had O
only O
one O
outlet O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
item O
for O
a O
while O
now O
( O
less O
than O
a O
year O
) O
and O
it O
's O
had O
some O
issues O
, O
mostly O
with O
the O
rubber O
pads O
that O
should O
keep O
the O
laptop O
from O
sliding O
off O
. O

The O
Pros O
of O
this O
gadget O
bring O
it O
very O
near O
perfection O
, O
especially O
compared O
to O
similar O
devices O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
bag O
for O
my O
new O
17 O
. O

He O
bought O
this O
laptop O
and O
a O
backpackCase O
Logic O
DLBP-116 O

On O
the O
positive O
side O
: O
the O
bag O
is O
light O
and O
does O
seem O
to O
provide O
enough O
padding O
and O
protection O
. O

Great O
for O
toting O
your O
laptop O
and O
phone O
along O
. O

I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
new O
battery O
since O
the O
original O
died O
. O

No O
Delete O
key O
( O
which O
may O
or O
may O
not O
bother O
you).As O
a O
technical O
writer O
, O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
my O
keyboard O
layout O
. O

Luckily O
it O
did O
n't O
toast O
out O
MacBookPro O
. O

Good O
quality O
picture O
. O

and O
I O
traveled O
twice O
on O
a O
train O
with O
it O
and O
would O
not O
recommend O
carrying O
it O
on O
your O
back O
for O
long O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
in O
it O
. O

Then O
one O
day O
, O
a O
sleek O
, O
sexy O
chick O
/ O
dude O
catches O
your O
eye O
& O
you O
start O
hanging O
out O
with O
her O
/ O
him O
& O
pretty O
soon O
you O
're O
kicking O
that O
old O
broad O
/ O
bum O
out O
on O
the O
street O
. O

The O
rear O
pocket O
is O
well O
organized O
with O
locations O
for O
individual O
laptop O
cords O
. O

Inside O
the O
front O
compartment O
itself O
, O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
zippered O
pocket O
at O
the O
top O
half O
of O
the O
compartment O
. O

Definitely O
not O
! O
! O
! O
! O
Do O
I O
think O
that O
if O
you O
use O
the O
laptop O
for O
the O
same O
things O
as O
me O
that O
you O
should O
consider O
purchasing O
one O
? O

It O
was O
also O
rated O
# O
1 O
overall O
LCD O
by O
Consumer O
Reports O
and O
received O
very O
high O
ratings O
by O
cNet O
- O
I O
would O
definitely O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
refers O
to O
the O
cable O
as O
" O
dangerous O
garbage O
. O
" O

But O
how O
long O
is O
the O
life O
of O
the O
battery O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
sped O
up O
my O
Canon O
MX860 O
printer O
( O
using O
a O
IOGEAR O
BT2 O
. O

( O
all O

goal O

that O
, O
at O
minimum O

we O

) O

But O
until O
they O
are O
more O
affordable O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
know O
personally O
. O

The O
picture O
is O
n't O
quite O
as O
stunning O
as O
their O
120Hz O
1080P O
models O
, O
but O
still O
very O
, O
very O
good O
and O
at O
a O
much O
lower O
price O
. O

works O
great O

But O
even O
though O
this O
pack O
is O
very O
useful O
, O
I O
can O
not O
give O
it O
more O
than O
3 O
stars O
. O

and O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
like O

I O
'll O
never O
go O

Other O
times O

there O
is O
no O

I O
'll O

the O
" O
triple O
ball O
effect O
. O
" O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
cause O
you O
can O
turn O
the O
speed O
down O
on O
it O
. O

That O
thing O
was O
bulletproof O
for O
years O
. O

It O
's O
not O
the O
best O
sounding O
speaker O

Super O
simple O
to O
install O
no O
drivers O
needed O
on O
windows O
7 O
just O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
it O
loads O
everything O
on O
its O
own O
. O

But O
, O
do O
to O
the O
greater O
number O
of O
channels O
in O
the O
5 O
GHz O
band O
and O
slightly O
less O
distance O
for O
transmission O
in O
this O
band O
, O
I O
can O
receive O
excellent O
5 O

in O
my O
home O

The O
back O
, O
sides O
, O
and O
bottom O
of O
the O
sleeve O
are O
constructed O
from O
a O
vinyl O
mesh O
material O
and O
there O
is O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
padding O
on O
the O
front O
and O
back O
( O
the O
sides O
and O
bottom O
have O
thinner O
padding O
) O
. O

It O
is O
a O
red O
laser O
optical O
mouse O
so O
there O
are O
no O
roller O
balls O
to O
clean O
or O
remove- O

Battery O
came O
in O
very O
good O
condtion O
( O
NEW O
) O
, O
package O
very O
well O
, O
and O
came O
very O
quickly O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
charge O
all O
of O
my O
electronic O
things O
with O
it O
. O

I O
must O
end O
by O
commending O
AnkerDirect O
for O
the O
great O
after O
sales O
service O
received O
. O

For O
those O
who O
may O
have O
issues O
with O
pop O
- O
ups O
, O
just O
go O
into O
Control O
Panel O
and O
to O
UnInstall O
Programs O
, O
or O
restor O
to O
factory O
settings O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
back O

up O
personal O

, O
and O
softwear O
. O

I O
would O
have O
preferred O
a O
way O
to O
keep O
the O
cord O
from O
getting O
near O
the O
fans O
. O

but O
it O
really O
bugged O
me O
when O
i O
would O
pick O
up O
some O
other O
laptops O
and O
the O
screen O
would O
be O
wobbling O
back O
and O
fourth O
... O

I O
believe O
it O
was O
a O
trial O
version O
of O
Norton O
Antivirus O
that O
was O
annoying.*****6 O
months O
into O
ownership O
this O
laptop O
is O
everything O
I O
expected O
and O
more O
. O

The O
fan O
works O
pretty O
good O
, O
almost O
no O
noise O
at O
all O
. O

Dell O
offers O
these O
batteries O
for O
upward O
of O
$ O
100 O
and O
still O
can O
not O
promise O
more O
than O
a O
2 O
year O
life O
. O

I O
never O
got O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Tuning O
speed O
variation O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
the O
idea O
is O
well O
thought O
out O
. O

This O
Chromebook O
is O
excellent O
! O

If O
all O
you O
do O
is O
websurf O
and O
write O
letters O
to O
grandmom O
, O
you O
will O
be O
ok O
with O
1 O
gb O
. O

Works O
well O
and O
has O
not O
dropped O
a O
connection O
since O
I O
installed O
it O
3 O
months O
ago O
. O

I O
guess O
that O
's O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
dream O
of O
alien O
abduction O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
buy O
this O
again O
. O

I O
've O
been O
through O
all O
the O
recent O
WiFi O
receivers O
, O
and O
none O
of O
them O
ever O
worked O
reliably O
. O

The O
reason O
why O
I O
purchased O
it O
was O
because O
I O
needed O
a O
small O
and O
light O
laptop O
for O
dictation O
/ O
notes O
while O
in O
my O
classes O
. O

These O
plug O
adapters O
seem O
perfect O
. O

Otherwise O
its O
holding O
up O
pretty O
good O
. O

Its O
been O
predicted O
for O
decades O
. O

I O
really O
rate O
this O
item O
2 O
1/2 O
stars O
. O

The O
price O
is O
high O
, O
but O
get O
it O
, O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
you O
wo O
nt O
be O
sorry O
. O

Great O
for O
students O
, O
the O
office O
, O
and O
everyday O
life O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
bothered O
by O
these O
things O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
getting O
this O
battery O
. O

This O
same O
effect O
showed O
up O
when O
viewing O
images O
or O
video O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
dark O
colors O
. O

so O
I O
took O
the O
plunge O
and O
was O
hugely O
surprised O
at O
the O
sound O
this O
thing O
pumps O
out O

Happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
the O
tablet O
looks O
& O
works O
great O
. O

Done O
.... O
works O
fine O
now O
. O

The O
speed O
and O
power O
of O
this O
computer O
is O
amazing O
. O

Run O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
cable O
up O
and O
out O
by O
your O
belly O
button O
and O
to O
your O
laptop O
, O
then O
start O
computing O
! O

but O
I O
would O
n't O
count O
on O
this O
lasting O
. O

The O
second O
I O
plug O
my O
factory O
power O
supply O
into O
my O
laptop O
the O
light O
on O
the O
transformer O
instantly O
goes O
out O
requiring O
me O
to O
unplug O
and O
plug O
back O
in O
the O
power O
supply O
in O
order O
to O
regain O
power O
. O

Just O
in O
case O
others O
wonder O
about O
other O
language O
support O
... O

The O
back O
of O
it O
and O
the O
straps O
are O
more O
cushoined O
then O
other O
backpacks O
I O
have O
owned O
, O
I O
could O
tell O
the O
difference O
right O
away O
. O

In O
this O
cable O
, O
I O
believe O
the O
conversion O
from O
hdmi O
to O
DVI O
happens O
in O
the O
end O
with O
the O
DVI O
plug O
. O

Due O
to O
some O
of O
the O
obvious O
design O
compromises O
, O
I O
reluctantly O
give O
this O
product O
4 O
stars O
. O

The O
front O
compartment O
has O
spots O
for O
pens O
, O
note O
pads O
, O
electronics O
or O
whatever O
you O
might O
need O
to O
carry O
and O
the O
little O
slot O
inside O
of O
the O
laptop O
compartment O
holds O
my O
small O
bamboo O
and O
stylus O
perfectly O
. O

2 O
. O
0 O
is O
becoming O
more O
common O
) O
. O

It O
also O
fits O
nicely O
onto O
the O
top O
of O
roll O
aboard O
luggage O
. O

So O
fast O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
some O
times O
just O
booting O
up O
and O
reading O
my O
emails O
will O
already O
have O
used O
up O
75 O
% O
battery!!Minor O
trouble O
; O
the O
D O
- O
link O
utility O
does O
the O
exact O
samething O
that O
Windows O
XP O
wireless O
connection O
manager O
does O
. O

I O
have O
had O
one O
of O
these O
for O
each O
of O
my O
laptops O
for O
three O
years O
now O
. O

So O
I O
have O
to O
have O
a O
separate O
DVD O
player O
to O
read O
DVD O

Perfect O
size O
for O
toting O
around O
for O
an O
all O
day O
photo O
shoot O
! O

I O
purchased O
this O
unit O
after O
months O
of O
searching O
for O
a O
way O
to O
add O
extra O
USB O
ports O
which O
did O
n't O
involve O
using O
a O
USB O
hub O
and O
external O
power O
supply O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
yesterday O
when O
I O
attempted O
to O
use O
the O
setup O
I O
found O
that O
the O
E5 O
sound O
output O
died O
. O

PRO O
: O
Comfy O
. O

One O
unforgivable O
annoyance O
is O
that O
often O
, O
when O
I O
'm O
typing O
, O
I O
'll O
get O
double O
letters O
even O
though O
I O
've O
only O
pushed O
a O
key O
once O
. O

It O
is O
used O
for O
gaming O
only O
, O
so O
in O
that O
respect O
it O
's O
an O
okay O
piece O
of O
technology O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
trackpad O
on O
my O
mini O
9 O
better O
than O
the O
Acer O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
last O
as O
long O
as O
one O
would O
hope O
. O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
gaming O
laptop O

Absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

As O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
electronics O
these O
days O
, O
I O
cover O
most O
of O
it O
with O
electric O
tape O
and O
just O
leave O
a O
tiny O
area O
exposed O
. O

Then O
after O
it O
focused O
in O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
spots O
( O
green O
squares O
show O
this O
on O
the O
lcd O
screen O
) O
it O
took O
the O
shot O
. O

Came O
with O
75 O
% O
of O
full O
charge O
, O
booted O
and O
ran O
my O
laptop O
just O
fine O
, O
took O
charging O
well O
, O
ran O
laptop O
several O
hours O
on O
a O
charge O
and O
still O
had O
plenty O
of O
juice O
left O
. O

Sent O
it O
back O
to O
Amazon O
free O
of O
charge O
and O
my O
money O
was O
quickly O
refunded O
for O
the O
defective O
in O
- O
line O
port O
. O

Great O
buy O
. O

Did O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
recognizing O
the O
charger O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
screen O
is O
a O
50&#34 O
; O

No O
matter O
how O
I O
positioned O
it O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
very O
clear O
. O

If O
a O
DVI O
- O
equipped O
device O
is O
used O
, O
separate O
audio O
cables O
will O
also O
be O
needed O
from O
the O
device O
to O
the O
" O
DVI O

had O
one O
for O
my O
macbook O
13 O
and O
had O
to O
get O
one O
for O
my O
mac O
book O
15 O
..... O
this O
is O
the O
best O
cover O
a O
macbook O
can O
ever O
get O
... O

The O
not O
- O
so O
- O
good O
: O
figuring O
out O
how O
the O
backpack O
straps O
work O
should O
not O
be O
this O
hard O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
inside O
at O
night O
at O
fairly O
low O
light O
conditions O
, O
and O
it O
works O
well O
, O
just O
not O
stunning O
. O

The O
keys O
are O
also O
slightly O
bigger O
than O
the O
original O
key O
on O
Macbook O
Air O
so O
a O
little O
bit O
confused O
. O

My O
bag O
still O
works O
though O
, O
I O
just O
use O
it O
less O
these O
days O
. O

i O
spent O
a O
lot O
less O
time O
wiping O
down O
my O
hdtv O
screen O
with O
it O
to O
remove O
the O
streaks O
. O

But O
it O
is O
far O
from O
the O
best O
. O

This O
can O
be O
done O
with O
the O
unit O
powered O
on O
or O
off O
. O

I O
've O
got O
it O
installed O
in O
a O
Dell O
Latitude O
D600 O
laptop O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

It O
is O
excellent O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
type O
on O
, O
and O
like O
other O
users O
have O
commented O
, O
it O
can O
go O
on O
forever O
before O
you O
need O
to O
recharge O
it O
by O
hooking O
it O
up O
to O
a O
computer O
via O
USB O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
stay O
in O
place O
either O
. O

It O
does O
make O
the O
iPad O
wider O
, O
but O
to O
my O
hands O
, O
not O
so O
much O
so O
as O
to O
be O
unduly O
large O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
solid O
netbook O
with O
plenty O
of O
battery O
life O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O
. O

and O
I O
was O
dissatisfied O
with O
their O
customer O
service O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
case O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O

I O
taught O
her O
how O
to O
use O
the O
web O
browser O
and O
Facebook O
. O

that O
laser O
light O
turns O
off O
after O
awhile O
, O
will O
save O

The O
only O
issue O
is O
making O
sure O
that O
the O
front O
end O
is O
elevated O
on O
something O
, O
or O
some O
sort O
of O
' O
traction O
' O
is O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
slide O
off O
. O

like O
I O
did O
with O
the O
last O
one O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
display O
pictures O
make O
it O
seem O
extra O
glossy O
when O
it O
's O
not O
. O

Small O
, O
rechargable O
, O
no O
hum O
or O
noise O
, O
does O
n't O
make O
audio O
tinny O
, O
very O
happy O
for O
price O
. O

Its O
design O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

It O
's O
running O
at O
a O
comfortable O
66 O
C O
at O
the O
moment O
and O
never O
gets O
over O
100 O
with O
this O

Al O
stood O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O

, O
helpless O

What O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
. O

Works O
well O
for O

too O
. O

This O

is O

is O
worth O

Fairly O
easy O
to O

setup O
and O
operate O
. O

Since O
I O
'm O
installing O
on O
an O
ASUS O
net O
- O
book O
, O
I O
dug O
out O
the O
USB O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
drive O
, O
hooked O
it O
up O
and O
inserted O
the O
CD O
that O
came O
with O
the O
unit O
. O

It O
is O
a O
total O
rip O
- O
off O
. O

With O
the O
laptop O
in O
place O
and O
the O
case O
closed O
, O
it O
measures O
8 O
in O
wide O
, O
12 O
. O
75 O
in O
in O
length O
. O

I O
love O
that O
feature O
. O

This O
bag O
could O
n't O
be O
better O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
's O
perfectly O
small O
but O
with O
enough O
pocket O
space O
to O
hold O
my O
wall O
charger O
, O
mouse O
pad O
, O
mouse O
, O
and O
miscellaneous O
cables O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
do O
FireWire O
downloading O
to O
your O
Mac O
, O
get O
an O
iMac O
or O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Backlit O
keyboard O
is O
very O
useful O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
bore O
anyone O
to O
tears O
with O
a O
long O
review O
, O
since O
pretty O
much O
all O
that O
was O
said O
on O
the O
tv O
has O
been O
said O
. O

I O
also O
like O
doing O
business O
with O
Amazon O
. O

The O
picture O
quality O
is O
really O
good O

Its O
like O
286 O
slow O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
auto O
- O
on O
feature O
really O
works O

Also O
make O
the O
side O
pocket O
expand O
more O
to O
accommodate O
the O
power O
supply O
and O
mouse O
. O

I O
'm O
delighted O
with O
the O
Alpatronix O
. O

I O
have O
tentatively O
tried O
the O
search O
and O
it O
recognized O
my O
hen O
scratching O
quite O
well O
. O

I O
have O
also O
bought O
the O
Moshi O
keyboard O
cover O
which O
I O
happen O
to O
really O
like O
too O
. O

This O
is O
why O
this O
particular O
battery O
is O
listed O
as O
' O
no O
disc O
required O
' O
. O

I O
recommend O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
computer O
before O
buying O
, O
look O
at O
support O
reviews O
first O
, O
then O
you O
will O
not O
waste O
your O
hard O
earned O
money O
and O
make O
a O
good O
decision O
. O

So O
when O
opening O
and O
closing O
the O
screen O
, O
it O
rubs O
against O
it O
. O

anytime O
I O
use O
them O
. O

While O
not O
audiophile O
, O
it O
will O
boost O
any O
little O
speaker O
built O
in O
to O
expand O
a O
space O
, O
and O
to O
make O
sound O
more O
lifelike O
, O
less O
tinny O
. O

It O
even O
weighs O
less O
than O
my O
everyday O
bag O
, O
which O
only O
has O
925 O
cu O
. O
in O
. O
of O
storage O
space O
. O

It O
was O
superior O
to O

because O
I O
could O
wander O
into O
a O
nearby O
room O

place O
this O
speaker O
near O
the O
door O
( O
to O
minimize O
distance O
and O
obstructions O
of O
the O
signal O
) O
and O
then O
wander O
around O

if O
you O
have O
a O

This O

If O
you O
need O

out O
for O

you O
may O
want O
something O
bigger O

something O
in O

this O
. O

I O
use O
my O
Itouch O
but O
the O
Apple O
Clarity O
HD O
version O
looks O
much O
worse O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Sorry O
, O
I O
know O
it O
sounds O
more O
like O
I O
'm O
reviewing O
the O
headset O
vs O
the O
adapter O
. O

This O
Asus O
laptop O
really O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
a O
microphone O
included O
in O
the O
camera O
, O
skype O
communications O
ran O
crisp O
and O
clear O

it O
scales O

extends O

She O

order O
this O
one O

Even O
after O
these O

the O

What O
is O
a O
Digital O

? O

Canon O
FS31 O
fails O
miserably O
. O

After O
reading O
the O
positive O
reviews O
on O
this O
small O
bluetooth O
speaker O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
for O
kitchen O
listening O
, O
sharing O
phone O
calls O
from O
grandmom O
and O
enhancing O
the O
sound O
when O
I O
stream O
movies O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
want O
, O
I O
need O
compartments O
for O
everything O
. O

Unfortunately O
many O
apps O
, O
like O
Pandora O
have O
no O
equalizer O
, O
but O
for O
these O
tiny O
of O
speakers O
, O
it O
really O
is O
n't O
super O
crucial O
as O
these O
sound O
10 O
times O
better O
than O
the O
built O
- O
in O
speakers O
without O
using O
an O
equalizer O
. O

Last O
word O
. O

No O
Pandora O
or O
Rhapsody O
or O
Airplay O
or O
anything O
else O
. O

Seems O
to O
work O
just O
fine O
( O
according O
to O
them O
) O
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

It O
plays O
your O
music O
whether O
from O
a O
Bluetooth O
source O
, O
a O
MicroSD O
Card O
, O
or O
from O
most O
devices O
via O
AUX O
jack O
. O

Web O
Chatting O
: O
Picture O
is O
decent O
, O
but O
nothing O
special O
. O

The O
redesign O
of O
this O
port O
on O
the O
newer O
Blackberry O
is O
much O
stronger O
than O
the O
previous O
generation O
of O
this O
smart O
phone O
. O

so O
I O
gave O
it O
five O
stars O
. O

The O
only O
cons O
are O
with O
Windows O
8 O
-- O
which O
are O
only O
cons O
if O
you O
live O
in O
an O
area O
like O
ours O
where O
there O
's O
no O
luxury O
of O
high O
- O
speed O
internet O
( O
SE O
Ohio O
) O
: O
You O
'll O
need O
to O
uninstall O
all O
of O
the O
pre O
- O
loaded O
aps O
so O
they O
do O
n't O
eat O
your O
bandwidth O
. O

it O
's O
full O
potential O
. O

It O
's O
just O
small O
enough O
to O
make O
it O
through O
the O
carry O
on O
of O
an O
airplane O
. O

It O
is O
very O
good O
workmanship O
with O
thick O
, O
nice O
looking O
aluminum O
housing O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
deal O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
! O

Whatever O
happened O
to O
those O
? O

The O
yellow O
RCA O
cable O
is O
not O
that O
good O
though O
. O

I O
could O
NOT O
be O
happier O
with O
that O
speaker O
! O

Setting O
down O
this O
bag O
too O
hard O
seems O
like O
it O
could O
result O
in O
significant O
shock O
on O
a O
heavy O
laptop O
in O
this O
area O
, O
especially O
a O
corner O
strike O
. O

Works O
well O
for O
my O
2008 O
model O
, O
why O
? O

The O
mouse O
itself O
is O
pretty O
sturdy O
, O
tracks O
better O
than O
the O
Apple O
mouse O
that O
came O
with O
my O
computer O
( O
an O
Imac O
) O
, O
and O
it O
DOES O
work O
from O
over O
10 O
feet O
away O
. O

This O
Transformer O
pad O
is O
so O
intuitive O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
auto O
updating O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
light O
duty O
. O

I O
took O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
mine O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
they O
have O
changed O
it O
to O
all O
metal O
. O

They O
will O
refuse O
to O
honor O
claims O
and O
then O
delay O
the O
payment O
of O
the O
claim O
until O
your O
contract O
expires O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
very O
decent O
. O

The O
Nvidia O
GT O
620 O
M O
is O
very O
nice O
to O
have O
and O
makes O
work O
much O
smoother O
within O
applications O
like O
Photoshop O
, O
however O
it O
still O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
muscle O
of O
my O
old O
GTX O
260M. O

The O
zippered O
pouches O
on O
the O
outside O
are O
nice O
, O
but O
could O
also O
use O
some O
more O
room O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
choose O
the O
color O
of O
the O
backlighting O
, O
and O
the O
lighting O
across O
the O
keys O
is O
n't O
terribly O
consistent O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
simple O
brand O

I O
've O
had O
the O
bag O
for O
about O
1 O
year O
. O

On O
my O
other O
computer O
I O
am O
using O
a O
3 O
year O
old O
power O
cord O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

On O
a O
full O
charge O
, O
it O
reports O
about O
7 O
. O
5 O
- O
8 O
hrs O
. O

But O
due O
to O
the O
large O
" O
Caps O
Lock O
" O
key O
, O
every O
thing O
seems O
to O
be O
shifted O
a O
little O
bit O
to O
the O
right O
, O
then O
your O
normal O
keyboard O
. O

Masking O
tape O
is O
just O
the O
trick O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
sound O
. O

As O
a O
bonus O
, O
the O
receiver O
slides O
into O
the O
mouse O

I O
'm O
serious O
when O
I O
say O
this O
is O
my O
favorite O
feature.- O

This O
particular O
TV O
caught O
my O
eye O
right O
away O
as O
the O
best O
looking O
one O
of O
the O
40-inchers O
. O

Recently O
, O
I O
received O
a O
new O
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
have O
the O
DVI O
connection O
on O
my O
docking O
station O
. O

You O
can O
choose O
your O
options O
from O
points O
of O
interest O
and O
the O
Garmin O
will O
continue O
to O
update O
showing O
you O
the O
direction O
and O
distance O
of O
all O
the O
valid O
choices O
. O

Tech O
support O
is O
aware O
of O
the O
random O
occurrence O
of O
the O
issue O
and O
says O
they O
are O
working O
on O
it O
. O

The O
only O
flaw O
I O
discovered O
occurred O
when O
I O
opened O
the O
back O
of O
the O
mouse O
while O
the O
transmitter O
was O
still O
plugged O
into O
my O
laptop O
's O
USB O
port O
, O
which O
turned O
off O
the O
mouse O
power O
; O
my O
laptop O
displayed O
a O
message O
that O
it O
needed O
to O
be O
rebooted O
, O
and O
the O
screen O
was O
completely O
frozen O
, O
disabling O
the O
normal O
restart O
/ O
shut O
down O
menus O
. O

There O
is O
the O
standard O
beverage O
compartment O
. O

This O
tiny O
mouse O
comes O
with O
no O
instructions O
. O

The O
other O
two O
cameras O
would O
not O
work O
with O
my O
AT&T O
; O
e O
- O
mail O
, O
which O
like O
gmail O
requires O
SSL O
to O
connect O
and O
send O
mail O
. O

I O
can O
get O
a O
much O
cheaper O
alternative O
to O
replace O
the O
$ O
117 O
battery O
the O
Apple O
store O
wants O
-- O

Small O
and O
inconspicuous O
are O
major O
advantages O
. O

It O
is O
a O
beautiful O
, O
well O
built O
unit O
and O
would O
compliment O
any O
decor O
. O

look O
distinctly O
green O
. O

Then O
, O
you O
could O
hear O
from O
her O
voice O
that O
she O
started O
thinking O
you O
are O
a O
' O
stupid O
woman O
' O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
generic O
and O
aftermarket O
batteries O
had O
many O
negative O
reviews O
and/or O
the O
vendors O
seemed O
sketchy O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
seem O
as O
pronounced O
with O
classical O
music O
to O
me O
. O

I O
found O
the O
bag O
very O
comfortable O
.. O

This O
was O
fixed O
, O
though O
, O
when O
I O
got O
tired O
of O
changing O
file O
settings O
individually O
and O
just O
copied O
everything O
to O
my O
desktop O

The O
wires O
for O
the O
fans O
underneath O
are O
exposed O
and O
can O
pull O
out O
easy O
. O

fades O
in O
and O
out O
frequently O
. O

This O
sleeve O
is O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O
the O
Dell O
Mini O
9 O
. O

Thus O
the O
three O
stars O
. O

I O
love O
the O
separate O
pocket O
on O
top O
strictly O
for O
the O
camera O
for O
quick O
access O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
buy O
a O
few O
notebooks O
for O
my O
nephews O
for O
Xmas O
. O

Chromebook O
optimized O
page O
, O
similar O
to O
how O
MSN O
is O
completely O
different O
in O
Windows O
8 O
from O
any O
other O
Windows O
version O
, O
even O
on O
a O
PC O
in O
desktop O
mode O
. O

When O
I O
sold O
it O
and O
replaced O
it O
with O
an O
MSI O
GT70 O
I O
continued O
to O
use O
it O
for O
the O
GT70 O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
much O
cooler O
laptop O

It O
fits O
my O
Macbook O
air O
like O
a O
glove O
, O
offering O
great O
protection O
in O
a O
very O
classy O
sleeve O
. O

The O
new O
Ipad3 O
is O
rumored O
to O
be O
out O
in O
early O
March O
and O
I O
am O
going O
to O
wait O
to O
see O
what O
the O
offerings O
are O
and O
either O
buy O
the O
Ipad2 O
if O
the O
prices O
are O
dropped O
or O

There O
are O
no O
crooked O
seams O
or O
so O
much O
as O
a O
loose O
thread O
. O

Well O
I O
am O
only O
giving O
this O
item O
4 O
stars O
because O
I O
have O
nt O
really O
had O
it O
long O
enough O
to O
say O
its O
great O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
to O
score O
it O
low O
for O
any O
reason O
. O

you O
want O
like O
pedals O
, O
amps O
, O
etc O
. O

it O
's O
like O
I O
'm O
working O
on O
a O
desktop O
with O
the O
laptop O
out O
of O
mind O
- O
out O
of O
site O
. O

I O
also O
use O
it O
for O
my O
media O
center O
computer O
. O

Also O
the O
menu O
system O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
I O
've O
ever O
used O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
ordered O
it O
with O
Amazon O
2 O
day O
shipping O
( O
free O
for O
Prime O
members O
) O
and O
it O
was O
delivered O
by O
the O
USPS O
on O
a O
Sunday O
! O
Impressive O
! O

For O
a O
$ O
2 O
, O
200 O
laptop O
this O
is O
unacceptable O
. O

She O
uses O
the O
laptop O
like O
a O
typical O
teenager O
and O
she O
has O
n't O
complained O
about O
it O
not O
holding O
a O
charge O
in O
the O
about O
3 O
months O
she O
has O
had O
it O
. O

But O
this O
more O
" O
traditional O
phone O
" O
designed O
to O
hold O
an O
iPhone O
looked O
perfect O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
fits O
YOUR O
sony O
walkman O
! O

And O
you O
get O
three O
large O
pockets O
, O
good O
for O
really O
loading O
up O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
selection O
of O
smaller O
pockets O
. O

It O
has O
a O
3 O
- O
5 O
hour O
battery O
life O
( O
dependent O
upon O
type O
of O
use O
) O
and O
with O
its O
17 O
" O
screen O
is O
rather O
large O
to O
haul O
around O
. O

Full O
HD O
videos O
are O
great O
but O
they O
are O
best O
played O
using O
the O
camcorder O
and O
mini O
HDMI O
cable O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
price O
of O
a O
Mac O
is O
higher O
, O
but O
if O
you O
combine O
the O
better O
stability O
along O
with O
the O
better O
support O
from O
Apple O
, O
its O
money O
well O
spent O
. O

The O
unit O
itself O
is O
compact O
, O
square O
, O
shiny O
and O
nice O
looking O
- O
the O
black O
color O
works O
in O
well O
with O
our O
Mac O
's O
black O
areas O
bordering O
the O
monitor O
and O
the O
Apple O
logo O
on O
front O
which O
is O
also O
black O
, O
so O
it O
all O
looks O
very O
nice O
together O
. O

The O
keyboard O
feels O
great O
, O
but O
I O
realize O
everyone O
's O
tastes O
differ O
on O
keyboards O
. O

I O
returned O
all O
those O
, O
and O
my O
mini O
, O
cuz O
the O
word O
app O
iPages O
is O
terrible O
IMO O
. O

Cons:- O
Stops O
charging O
once O
phone O
is O
fully O
charged O
and O
does O
not O
top O
off O
, O
thus O
if O
you O
charge O
overnight O
the O
phone O
will O
be O
draining O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
after O
it O
initially O
charges O
. O

Great O
sound O
from O
this O
small O
device O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
stick O
with O
1333MHz O
since O
this O
laptop O
( O
and O
most O
others O
) O
apparently O
ca O
n't O
go O
any O
faster O
, O
thus O
no O
reason O
to O
spend O
more O
on O
1600MHz O
. O

I O
have O
it O
paired O
with O
a O
27&#34 O
; O
iMac O
btw O
. O

but O
it O
only O
connected O
at O
54 O
Mbps O
even O
when O
it O
was O
the O
only O
device O
on O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
inclusive O
of O
the O
secret O
compartment O
that O
rests O
against O
your O
back O
. O

Negative O
: O
No O
driver O
for O
Windows O
8 O
Pro O
that O
is O
reliable O
or O
functional O
in O
all O
cases O
. O

TheiDsonix O

0 O

Item O
arrived O
quickly O
. O

I O
'm O
working O
solely O
in O
the O
Win7 O
desktop O
mode O
. O

If O
this O
laptop O
had O
lasted O
3 O
years O
or O
so O
( O
the O
average O
replacement O
rate O
for O
me O
) O

Even O
though O
I O
think O
this O
was O
the O
first O
modem O
available O
that O
offered O
4 O
G O
reception O
years O
ago O
, O
it O
is O
proving O
to O
be O
quite O
reliable O
so O
far O
. O

None O
of O
them O
really O
did O
the O
job O
well O
enough O
. O

This O
unit O
can O
acquire O
and O
maintain O
a O
position O
fix O
when O
inside O
my O
house O
on O
my O
kitchen O
counter O
. O

Dropped O
this O
in O
the O
hot O
tub O
and O
once O
it O
dried O
out O
, O
it O
still O
worked O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

All O
in O
all O
they O
are O
worth O
the O
$ O
63 O
i O
spent O
, O
but O
i O
think O
if O
i O
could O
make O
my O
decision O
again O
i O
would O
try O
looking O
for O
something O
with O
a O
little O
more O
bass O
, O
even O
with O
having O
a O
great O
system O
already O
in O
my O
room O
something O
just O
seems O
wrong O
about O
a O
subwoofer O
speaker O
being O
only O
3 O
" O
with O
15 O
watts O
of O

Excellent O
audio O
quality O

hard O
to O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
bluetooth O
and O
a O
direct O
connection O

It O

not O
loud O

but O
you O
know O
it O

running O

the O

me O

At O
some O
point O
in O
the O
future O
, O
I O
may O
upgrade O
, O
but O
my O
only O
reason O
for O
replacing O
them O
will O
be O
when O
even O
larger O
monitors O
with O
more O
pixels O
are O
available O
at O
comparable O
prices O

I O
needed O
to O
replace O
battery O
so O
went O
with O
extended O
life O
and O
it O
is O
living O
up O
to O
my O
hope O
and O
expectation O
. O

Although O
it O
has O
been O
used O
a O
lot O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
for O
anything O
too O
stressful O

When O

it O
will O
be O

My O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
calendar O
is O
buried O
in O
the O
email O
program O
- O
this O
means O
no O
direct O
access O
and O
no O
sync O
with O
iCal O
. O

It O
is O
very O
impressive O
and O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
excellent O
. O

In O
the O
4 O
months O
it O
worked O
the O
drive O
made O
booting O
and O
certain O
common O
tasks O
very O
quick O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
product O
for O
over O
a O
month O
now O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fantastic O
router O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
it O
for O
5 O
months O
now O
and O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
thus O
far O
. O

This O
device O
works O
very O
well O
. O

The O
laser O
is O
red O
and O
when O
I O
turn O
the O
switch O
on O
the O
bottom O
, O
it O
glows O
red O
by O
the O
roller O
too O
! O

It O
was O
so O
frustrating O
to O
disconnect O
it O
when O
I O
want O
to O
take O
my O
laptop O
somewhere O
. O

managed O
to O

up O
pretty O
well O
by O
now O
. O

Once O
it O

engaged O
, O
it O
works O
great O
. O

Ca O
nt O
complain O
. O

I O
just O
charge O
my O
tablet O
overnight O
so O
no O
one O
messes O
with O
the O
cord O
. O

It O
is O
used O
constantly O
and O
I O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O

are O
relatively O
inexpensive O
these O

anyways O
. O

USB2 O

will O
work O
but O
they O
're O
much O
slower O
. O

Bluetooth O
is O
finicky O
, O
be O
patient O
and O
read O
the O
instructions O
. O

* O
Comes O
with O
VGA O
, O

, O
and O

I O
personally O
searched O
far O
and O
wide O
to O
find O
a O
bag O
that O
could O
fit O
my O
iPad O
encased O
in O
Otter O
as O
well O
as O
hold O
my O
external O
hard O
drive O
and O

. O

Also O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
Android O
games O
is O
definitely O
on O
the O
rise O
, O
but O
is O
still O
no O
where O
near O
PS3 O
, O
Xbox O
360 O
or O
PC O

. O

It O
works O
without O
any O
hassles O
from O
my O
mac O
book O
air O
to O
HDMI O
input O
on O
the O
projector O
. O

A O
very O
good O

with O

very O
good O

There O
is O
a O

March O

, O
2012I O
got O
contacted O
by O
Laptopmate O
in O
the O
comments O
section O
. O

For O
sound O
transfer O
to O
headset O
, O
I O
connect O
it O
to O
Sony O
Ericsson O
MW600 O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
's O
not O
sensitive O
enough O
, O
and O
when O
you O
apply O
slightly O
more O
pressure O
, O
it O
's O
still O
not O
enough O
.. O

The O
mid O
and O
high O
range O
speaker O
on O
the O
WOWee O
One O
is O
surprisingly O
tinny O
, O
much O
like O
you O
'd O
expect O
from O
a O
child O
's O
boom O
box O
. O

My O
laptop O
would O
get O
so O
hot O
it O
would O
turn O
off O
and O
with O
this O
cooling O
pad O
that O
no O
longer O
happens O
. O

It O
does O
a O
good O
job O
, O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anything O
else O
! O

They O
have O
their O
place O
and O
applications O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
shopping O
for O
a O
quality O
video O
camera O
that O
delivers O
stunning O
footage O
, O
then O
HD O
resolution O
alone O
is O
n't O
enough O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
smaller O
, O
portable O
, O
underarm O
type O
briefcase O
for O
a O
small O
paper O
notebook O
, O
book O
, O
pens O
and O
some O
other O
gear O
/ O
gadgets O
. O

My O
son O
in O
Hawaii O
can O
see O
us O
clearly O
on O
his O
HD O
TV O
and O
the O
video O
is O
smooth O
when O
our O
internet O
connection O
is O
up O
to O
speed O
. O

It O
is O
less O
than O
an O
inch O
and O
a O
half O
thick O
. O

The O
seller O
delivered O
it O
within O
the O
promised O
time O
and O
offered O
a O
100 O
% O
no O
questions O
asked O
guarantee O
if O
not O
completely O
satisfied O
. O

All O
in O
all O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
device O
. O

and O
I O
get O
three O
plus O
hours O
of O
life O
out O
of O
it O
, O

It O
's O
got O
a O
very O
soft O
, O
protecting O
lining O
in O
the O
interior O
so O
it O
wo O
n't O
scratch O
your O
computer O
. O

compare O
to O
ace O

at O
$ O
79 O

Setup O
is O
virtually O
nonexistent O
; O
just O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
you O
're O
pretty O
much O
good O
to O
go O
. O

The O
antenna O
is O
only O
big O
enough O
to O
capture O
very O
local O
( O
over O
the O
air O
) O
stations O
but O
you O
can O
set O
the O
tuner O
to O
cable O
and O
when O
you O
hookup O
local O
analog O
cable O
you O
get O
all O
those O
stations O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
$ O
20 O
+ O
dollars O
. O

My O
inspiron O
takes O
the O
X284 O
G O
series O
of O
batteries O
, O
so O
this O
fit O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

The O
HP O
software O
is O
not O
really O
making O
the O
netbook O
slow O
, O
Norton O
security O
is O
very O
nice O
I O
must O
add O
, O
every O
time O
the O
machine O
did O
a O
google O
search O
, O
it O
tells O
me O
if O
the O
link O
is O
safe O
. O

The O
transfer O
speed O
is O
good O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
and O
protective O
case O
for O
a O
tablet O
. O

This O
solution O
is O
great O
since O
you O
can O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
MP3 O
player O
or O
just O
use O
the O
Micro O
SD O
card O
option O
. O

I O
was O
prepared O
for O
that O
and O
not O
an O
issue O
. O

SD O
CARDAn O
inserted O
SD O
card O
sticks O
out O
more O
than O
1/2 O
way O
! O

When O
the O
price O
is O
right O
, O
SanDisk O
's O
memory O
sticks O
are O
my O
first O
preference O
. O

I O
( O
obviously O
) O
had O
to O
cut O
mine O
to O
fit O
since O
it O
's O
designed O
for O
a O
55&#34 O
; O
but O
there O
are O
' O
cut O
' O
lines O
on O
the O
strip O
that O
are O
easily O
identified O
so O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
cut O
it O
in O
the O
wrong O
spot O
. O

Try O
to O
find O
a O
model O
with O
Win-7 O
and O
thank O
me O
later O
. O

I O
've O
used O
other O
wireless O
pay O
- O
as O
- O
you O
- O
go O
connections O
at O
airports O
and O
resorts O
with O
more O
bandwidth O
and O
for O
a O
lot O
less O
money O
. O

HP O
's O
Sleekbooks O
are O
very O
handsome O
devices O
. O

but O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
price O
he O
said O
absolutely O
get O
them O

So O
are O
the O
clips O
/ O
rings O
for O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
, O
but O
not O
cheap O
in O
quality O
. O

And O
it O
sounds O
great O
. O

KEYBOARD O
: O
blows O
. O

It O
fits O
well O
into O
my O
HTC O

. O

But O
when O
using O
D O
- O
cell O
batteries O
, O
they O
slides O
do O
not O
easily O
move O
out O
that O
far O
. O

For O
a O
while O
I O
could O
n't O
decide O
between O
this O
laptop O
and O
the O
Toshiba O
at O
staples O
( O
it O
has O
i7 O
quad O
core O
) O
, O
but O
what O
ultimately O
led O
me O
to O
picking O
this O
laptop O
can O
be O
described O
below O
. O

degrees O
are O
in O
F O
the O
USA O
standard O
temp O
thermal O
units O
measurements O
. O

There O
are O
circumstances O
where O
this O
device O
would O
be O
ideal O
. O

The O
translation O
tool O
, O
i O
'll O
probably O
definitely O
get O
. O

In O
5 O
years O
of O
buying O
- O
and O
2 O
years O
of O
being O
a O
heavy O
Amazon O
buyer O
- O
this O
is O
my O
first O
review O
. O

The O
speaker O
quality O
is O
good O
, O
but O
does O
n't O
really O
stand O
out O
. O

Seems O
to O
work O
well O
eith O
Autocad O
Sketchbook O
Pro O
that O
I O
bought O
the O
same O
time O
along O
with O
this O
. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
answer O
when O
my O
wife O
needed O
a O
longer O
cable O
for O
her O
Galaxy O
Tab O
7 O
. O
7 O
. O

It O
got O
a O
bit O
warm O
once O
( O
with O
Crysis O
played O
maxed O
out O
) O
but O
I O
just O
turned O
up O
the O
fan O
for O
a O
minute O
or O
so O
( O
to O
test O
how O
well O
it O
cooled O
) O
and O
the O
machine O
immediately O
cooled O
( O
again O
, O
it O
was O
not O
blistering O
hot O
, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
see O
if O
the O
extra O
cooling O
worked O
) O
. O

Since O
I O
keep O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
neoprene O
sleeve O
, O
I O
cut O
out O
the O
padded O
compartment O
, O
which O
took O
up O
~ O
1/2 O
of O
the O
compartment O
volume O
. O

The O
game O
play O
is O
smooth O
with O
midium O
resolution O
. O

If O
it O
could O
n't O
, O
I O
would O
most O
likely O
have O
returned O
it O
b O
/ O
c O
it O
can O
be O
a O
major O
distraction O
during O
some O
movies O
/ O
shows O
. O

I O
probably O
missed O
something O
in O
who O
to O
call O
, O
but O
I O
started O
off O
with O
HP O
customer O
support O
, O
and O
had O
to O
talk O
to O
three O
people O
before O
someone O
realized O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
service O
this O
device O

The O
performance O
, O
installation O
and O
design O
of O
the O
keyboard O
otherwise O
is O
flawless O
. O

There O
are O
stupid O
air O
bubbles O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
out O
! O

This O
is O
fine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
shuffle O
through O
a O
homemade O
MP3 O
CD O
each O
with O
hundreds O
of O
songs O
, O
but O
not O
so O
good O
for O
plain O
old O
audio O
CDs O
. O

Would O
I O
recommend O
this O
to O
a O
friend O
, O
not O
at O
this O
time O
. O

It O
is O
so O
loud O
, O
that O
it O
drowns O
out O
music O
when O
the O
volume O
is O
set O
to O
50 O
% O
. O

Shoots O
astoundingly O
great O
photos O
and O
can O
even O
do O
continuous O
- O
mode O
8-megapixel O
snapshots O
at O
5 O
frames O
/ O
second O
. O

The O
addition O
of O
an O
inside O
compartment O
for O
holding O
a O
folder O
or O
some O
papers O
would O
be O
a O
definite O
plus O
. O

unless O
you O
're O
a O
boombox O
junkie O
or O
a O
high O
fidelity O
concert O
fundi O
these O
desktop O
pc O
speakers O
will O
give O
you O
countless O
hours O
of O
crisp O
& O
clean O
listening O
pleasure O

plus O
the O
speed O
, O
ram O
and O
other O
features O
make O
it O
outstanding O
and O
with O
the O
price O
in O
my O
range O
, O
made O
it O
a O
no O
- O
brainer O
... O

Display O
is O
matte O
but O
not O
very O
bright O
and O
not O
very O
contrasty O
, O
so O
the O
the O
matte O
quality O
goes O
to O
waste O
in O
bright O
sun O
anyway O
. O

They O
offered O
me O
a O
different O
product O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
for O
tablets O
specifically O
and O
it O
is O
amazing O
. O

The O
backpack O
is O
nt O
cumbersome O
but O
for O
everyday O
use O
you O
may O
want O
something O
smaller O
to O
carry O
just O
the O
camera O
body O
a O
flash O
and O
a O
few O
lenses O
. O

It O
does O
not O
just O
snap O
on O
into O
place O
! O

Battery O
life O
is O
pretty O
decent O
. O

As O
for O
this O
product O
, O
it O
either O
meets O
expectations O
or O
does O
n't O
. O

Chromebook O
which O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

I O
can O
not O
make O
any O
comment O
on O
the O
durability O
of O
this O
product O
, O
since O
I O
the O
product O
just O
arrived O
today O
. O

Once O
that O
happens O
they O
load O
as O
fast O
as O
or O
faster O
than O
the O
San O
Disk O
. O

I O
have O
not O
used O
these O
adapters O
but O
their O
quality O
is O
not O
the O
best O
, O
for O
example O
, O
its O
coating O
is O
of O
different O
sizes O
for O
the O
same O
adapter O
, O
I O
hope O
they O
perform O
well O
when O
I O
will O
use O
them O
. O

It O
might O
not O
be O
100 O
% O
environmentally O
friendly O

the O
good O
thing O
is O
... O
air O
bubbles O
are O
hard O
to O
see O
after O
you O
turn O
on O
the O
display O
, O
but O
once O
the O
display O
is O
off O
.. O

did O
, O
and O
assigned O
the O
mounted O

The O
sticky O
is O
the O
same O
type O
of O
repositionable O
glue O
that O
's O
on O
thePost O
- O
it O

Does O
not O
interfere O
when O
I O
type O
( O
and O
I O
type O
a O
lot O
) O
, O
does O
not O
' O
jump O
' O
. O

Connections O
are O
tight O
and O
the O
cable O
used O
seems O
of O
high O
quality O
. O

With O
the O
OEM O
power O
supply O
, O
plugging O
in O
would O
accelerate O
the O
processor O
and O
help O
keep O
wireless O
streaming O
( O
Netflix O
, O
Hulu O
, O
etc O
) O
happy O
. O

Overall O
, O
you O
really O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
for O
the O
price O
. O

so O
I O
do O
not O
have O
to O
be O
right O
next O
to O
the O
stereo O

BUT O
the O
Cyberlink O
Power O
DVD10 O
sofware O
is O
outdated O

Very O
reasonable O
price O
for O
such O
good O
quality O
! O

In O
the O
end O
the O
laptop O
does O
provide O
the O
user O
with O
a O
smooth O
experience O
with O
a O
few O
quirks O
. O

- O
Medialink O
Wireless O
N O
USB O

The O
on O
- O
off O
switch O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
as O
well O
. O

; O
MBP O
w/ O
Retina O
Display O
. O

But O
since O
I O
intended O
to O
completely O
re O
- O
install O
the O
OS O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
bloatware O
it O
did O
n't O
matter.--Obviously O
you O
'll O
need O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
OS O
media O
/ O
DVD O
( O
and O
external O
drive!)/boot O
USB O
key O
to O
do O
a O
complete O
re O
- O
install O
as O
it O
does O
not O
come O
with O
the O
machine O
. O

Two O
of O
three O
of O
these O
that O
I O
bought O
arrived O
DOA O
. O

I O
still O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
this O
stupid O
compaq O
notebook O
wants O
! O
! O
! O

It O
is O
cheap O
in O
price O
but O
made O
well O
. O

Then O
visited O
the O
big O
boxes O
for O
hands O
on O
and O
comparisons O
. O

( O
Hint O
: O
make O
sure O
the O
new O
sticks O
are O
fully O
seated O
in O
the O
DIMM O
carrier O
, O
otherwise O
you O
'll O
get O
the O
Beeps O
of O
Despair O
. O
) O

It O
really O
feels O
like O
having O
a O
pillow O
on O
your O
back O
. O

Then O
adjust O
it O
to O
get O
the O
best O
view O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
quick O
replacement O
for O
my O
HP O
Pavilion O
desktop O
that O
died O
on O
me O
. O

May O
anf O
this O
cord O
died O
... O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
very O
fast O
. O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
cross O
that O
line O
. O

It O
's O
very O
masculine O
bag O
, O
which O
is O
something O
he O
was O
worried O
about O
, O
being O
a O
teen O
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
over O
1 O
pound O
. O

Our O
last O
XP O
machine O
died O
recently O
. O

When O
you O
tighten O
the O
screw O
more O
( O
not O
a O
lot O
) O
, O
the O
plastic O
breaks O
and O
it O
will O
never O
again O
stay O
where O
you O
want O
it O
. O

so O
I O
could O
manually O
set O
up O
the O
router O
it O
would O
n't O
do O
that O
again O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
on O
a O
tablet O
until O
I O
got O
better O
at O
it O

If O
the O
code O
is O
needed O
use O
0000 O
( O
four O
zeros).&#10004 O
; O
If O
you O
have O
tried O
this O
mouse O
on O
multiple O
devices O
, O
turn O
off O
bluetooth O
on O
all O
devices O
other O
than O
the O
one O
you O
are O
currently O
trying O
to O
configure O
so O
the O
mouse O
bluetooth O
will O
not O
try O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
previous O
device O
instead&#10004 O

I O
either O
had O
a O
really O
low O
batter O
on O
my O
Logitech O
Harmony O
remote O
or O
the O
IR O
blaster O
fell O
off O
of O
the O
device O
being O
controlled O
. O

I O
used O
the O
instructions O
from O
ifixit O
to O
help O
with O
the O
install O
. O

I O
give O
these O
the O
highest O
recommendation O
. O

Software O
bundle O
it O
comes O
with O
is O
basically O
useless O
. O

Microsoft O
forever O
! O
! O

This O
adapter O
fits O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
. O

The O
exterior O
leather O
feels O
nice O
and O
looks O
good O
. O

Thus O
causing O
me O
to O
come O
here O
and O
find O
this O
charger O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
check O
this O
when O
my O
new O
battery O
gets O
here O
for O
my O
Dell O
XPS O
M1530 O
. O

I O
thought O
getting O
a O
thin O
, O
lightweight O
laptop O
meant O
I O
had O
to O
settle O
for O
a O
slower O
one O
with O
less O
capability O
. O

Turned O
by O
100 O
GB O
SATA O
hardrive O
otherwise O
useless O
into O
a O
USB O
hardrive O
storage O
. O

This O
thing O
rocks O
, O
you O
can O
use O
it O
in O
many O
ways O
, O
you O
can O
use O
your O
mobile O
phone O
3 O
g O
to O
create O
a O
wide O
range O
wi O
- O
fi O
hotspot O
on O
the O
go O
, O
perfect O
for O
Recreational O
vehicles O
or O
places O
where O
you O
ca O
n't O
get O
cable O
of O
even O
a O
phone O
land O
line O
, O
also O
to O
repeat O
any O
wifi O
signal O
, O
between O
us O
, O
if O
you O
want O
hack O
a O
wifi O
signal O
, O
like O
neighbors O
or O
hotels O
nearby O
and O
use O
it O
, O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
gadget O

I O
let O
it O
drain O
to O
1 O
% O
then O
shut O
down2 O
) O

But O
again O
, O
I O
have O
no O
guarantee O
that O
the O
battery O
will O
hold O
a O
charge O
once O
it O
's O
unplugged O
from O
the O
outlet O
, O
or O
for O
how O
long O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
depend O
on O
it O
even O
if O
I O
charge O
it O
in O
advance O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
more O
useful O
and O
multifeatured O
device O
on O
the O
market O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

I O
have O
the O
TV O
for O
2 O
weeks O
now O
. O

My O
Bose O
SoundDock O
could O
n't O
use O
batteries O
, O
and O
neither O
could O
this O
, O
as O
it O
requires O
more O
power O
of O
an O
electrical O
outlet O
to O
do O
what O
it O
does O
. O

I O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
sister O
as O
a O
birthday O
gift O
, O
and O
a O
month O
later O
, O
I O
bought O
another O
one O
for O
my O
home O
office O
! O

I O
'm O
part O
of O
the O
group O
that O
has O
had O
no O
luck O
with O
these O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
you O
, O
but O
I O
hate O
having O
to O
contact O
people O
about O
this O
. O

It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
just O
fine O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
overly O
sturdy O
. O

When O
I O
would O
try O
to O
use O
it O
the O
machine O
would O
give O
an O
error O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
product O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

In O
the O
future O
, O
do O
n't O
trust O
your O
laptop O
with O
your O
mates O
unless O
you O
are O
BFFs O
, O
or O
you O
buy O
an O
ASUS O
;) O

This O
was O
despite O
being O
told O
by O
Electronica O
that O
they O
would O
send O
her O
a O
prepaid O
shipping O
label O
- O
they O
never O
sent O
the O
label O
. O

they O
are O
good O
enough O
. O

Not O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Body O
Glove O
, O
you O
only O
need O
15 O
. O

works O
great O
and O
backlight O
is O
great O
at O
night O
. O

Rather O
than O
duplicate O
peripherals O
, O
I O
got O
this O
device O
and O
the O
two O
computers O
to O
one O
set O
of O
peripherals O
. O

As O
for O
battery O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
solid O
. O

25 O
hours O
, O
beating O
on O
it O
the O
whole O
time O
pretty O
much O
. O

This O
works O
well O
. O

A O
screen O
resolution O
of O
at O
least O
1920x10802 O
) O

I O
am O
so O
disappointed O
with O
this O
product O
. O

THE O
DOCK O
LOOKS O

Suremost O
walkie O
talkie O
are O
better O
than O
these O
... O
but O
for O
what O
they O
are O
... O
there O
worth O
it O
. O

" O
Disable O
All O
Sound O
Effects O
" O
and O
" O
Immediate O
Mode O
" O
are O
both O
UNchecked O
. O

Though O
I O
am O
still O
getting O
used O
to O
Windows O
8 O
, O
I O
use O
this O
computer O
for O
everything O
. O

It O
fits O
the O
camera O
, O
and O
accessories O
, O
and O
then O
some O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sweet O
deal O
and O
the O
ram O
functions O
perfectly O
. O

Screen O
is O
really O
bright O
and O
clear O
; O

so O
she O
does O
n't O
have O
up O
unplug O
it O
every O
single O
time O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
a O
dock O
, O
but O
the O
power O
cord O
plugs O
in O
to O
the O
bottom O
easily O
with O
this O
cover O
on O
. O

Pretty O
easy O
setup O
. O

Its O
not O
that O
I O
feel O
cheated O
by O
3 O
inches O
, O
just O
that O
the O
cable O
is O
short O
and O
pulls O
everytime O

Well O
, O
I O
loved O
my O
bag O
so O
much O
-- O
and O
got O
so O
used O
to O
tucking O
items O
into O
specific O
pockets O
-- O
that O
it O
made O
sense O
to O
buy O
the O
same O
bag O
. O

I O
have O
the O
full O
HD O
screen O
and O
a O
blu O
ray O
writer O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
why O
others O
have O
had O
difficulties O
.... O
it O
could O
not O
have O
been O
easier O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
'll O
give O
me O
the O
chance O
to O
see O
how O
we O
can O
rectify O
the O
situation O
. O

Although O
AppleCare O
may O
not O
have O
paid O
for O
itself O
by O
just O
those O
, O
it O
feels O
good O
not O
to O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
failure O
of O
the O
motherboard O
or O
display O
. O

It O
connects O
easily O
and O
quickly O
. O

Other O
popular O
browsers O
, O
such O
as O
Google O
's O
Chrome O
, O
run O
pretty O
poorly O
on O
the O
TPT2 O
. O

I O
'd O
rather O
keep O
my O
iPhone O
closer O
to O
me O
, O
in O
my O
pocket O
. O

While O
editing O
videos O
in O
Sony O
Vegas O

Platinum O
, O
I O
found O
that O
the O
AMD O
graphics O
card O
likes O
to O
crash O
then O
it O
would O
say O

There O
is O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
discussion O
about O
the O
software O
that O
came O
with O
it O
not O
allowing O
you O
to O
transfer O

, O
but O
because O
I O
am O
not O
using O
that O

only O
using O
it O
in O
my O

EDITED O

I O
considered O
the O
tri O

. O

If O
you O
check O
out O
the O
reviews O
for O
these O
two O
individually O
you O
'd O
see O
that O
people O
are O
generally O
very O
happy O
with O
them O
. O

I O
'll O
start O
my O
cordless O
operation O
with O
a O
full O
charge O

This O
Targus O
takes O
it O
a O
step O
further O
by O
allowing O
use O
on O
your O

without O
blocking O

If O
I O
do O
I O

it O

I O
connected O
it O
to O
the O
usb O
on O
my O
laptop O
and O
was O
blown O
away O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
easy O
to O
type O
on O
. O

I O
have O
checked O
around O
for O
something O
which O
would O
state O
whether O
or O
not O
this O
is O
a O
Class O
1 O
or O
Class O
2 O
device O
, O
but O
just O
ca O
n't O
get O
anything O
to O
positive O
identify O
it O
. O

If O
anything O
, O
they O
are O
not O
high O
enough O
. O

I O
have O
used O
this O
daily O
for O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
years O
and O
it O
's O
been O
great O
. O

only O
2 O
high O
graphic O
games O
and O
maybe O
8 O
smaller O
games O
. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
hot O
keys O
set O
up O
for O
players O
, O
it O
will O
work O
great O
without O
even O
messing O
with O
the O
software O
. O

They O
certainly O
beat O
the O
built O

in O
my O

Mounted O
this O
to O
my O

to O
control O

no O
issues O
so O
far O
with O
it O
! O

( O
Let O
's O
just O
say O
that O
that O
machine O
was O
a O
massive O
compromise).XP O

that O

I O
finally O
attempted O
a O
Windows O

re O

install O
and O
things O
seem O
to O
be O
running O
ok O
, O
though O
with O
1 O
crash O
since O
the O
redo O
it O
makes O
me O
question O
it O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
really O
used O
it O
too O
much O
as O
I O
NEED O
reliability O
. O

Ca O
n't O
find O
a O
female O
to O
female O
adapter O
30 O
pin O
to O
usb O
. O

, O
I O
received O
two O
, O
maybe O
was O
3 O
emails O
from O
this O
company O
/ O
seller O
. O

The O
design O
is O
hard O
plastic O
on O
the O
top O
, O
with O
a O
curved O
dip O
from O
front O
to O
back O
. O

This O
USB O
adapter O
works O
great O
and O
allows O
me O
to O
connect O
both O
the O
keyboard O
and O
touch O
pad O
of O
the O
Adesso O
rackmount O
keyboard O
/ O
touchpad O
connectors O
in O
one O
USB O
port O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
give O
it O
3 O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
fits O
really O
tight O
in O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
I O
have O

The O

flushed O
( O

- O
there O
is O
no O

I O

m O
sooooooooooooooo O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
because O
now O
that O
means O
I O
can O
continue O
to O
use O
my O
laptop O
. O

And O
last O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
tabs O
open O
, O
it O
slows O
down O
, O
but O
all O
computers O
would O
do O
that O
. O

Have O
only O
had O
one O
LaCie O
problem O
in O
6 O
years O
, O
and O
that O
drive O
was O
bad O
from O
the O
start O
, O
so O
nothing O
was O
lost O
. O

Holy O
cow O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
believe O
it O
when O
I O
read O
these O
reviews O

Think O
of O
it O
the O

. O

Loves O
having O
the O
water O
bottle O
holder O
. O

And O
being O
able O
to O
program O
the O
buttons O
is O
a O
nice O
amenity O
. O

The O
case O
is O
not O
worth O
$ O
40 O
. O

Works O
fine O
on O
my O
old O
Win7 O
laptopAnother O
drawback O
is O
that O
Lenovo O
does O
not O
include O
or O
offer O
any O
software O
specific O
to O
this O
machine O
which O
can O
update O
your O
drivers O
and O
at O
least O
tell O
you O
if O
your O
BIOS O
is O
up O
to O
date O
and O
your O
machine O
has O
the O
most O
current O

This O

( O

just O

Highly O
recommended O

They O
are O

and O
they O
are O
more O
expensive O
. O

then O
you O
snap O
it O
down O

place O
) O
. O

It O
's O
really O
too O
small O
for O
a O
17&#34 O

. O

It O
looks O
pretty O
decent O
for O
such O
an O
economical O
buy O
and O
met O
my O
expectations O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

What O
can O
I O
say O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
said O
about O
intuos4 O
? O

That O
said O
, O
you O
do O
have O
to O
tug O
at O
the O
opening O
in O
the O
back O
to O
pull O
it O
over O
your O
laptop O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
nicer O
had O
they O
simply O
had O
an O
opening O
at O
one O
end O
. O

That O
being O
said O
this O
will O
sound O
much O
better O
than O
the O
speakers O
on O
your O
laptop O
or O
monitor O
speakers O
. O

; O
laptop O
fits O
great O
inside O
, O
with O
room O
for O
a O
book O
or O
two O
, O
and O
other O
small O
objects O
like O
a O
laptop O
charger O
, O

, O

, O
etc O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
definitely O
good O
enough O
for O
travel O
and O
boosts O
the O
volume O
more O
than O
enough O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
one O
complaint O
, O
the O

works O
very O
well O

up O

I O
rated O
it O
4 O

just O
for O
the O
reason O
above O
. O

The O
colors O
are O
cool O
and O
sure O
catches O

attention O

It O
simply O
works O
as O

perhaps O
even O
better O
. O

UNGODLY O
SLOW O
! O

The O
keyboard O
works O
well O
, O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
keys O
were O
curved O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
end O
( O
it O
makes O
for O
more O
accurate O
typing O
) O
, O
but O
they O
consistently O
work O
and O
the O

gets O
bonus O

DRIVERS O

The O
adjustable O
and O
easily O
removable O
black O
shoulder O
strap O
is O
optional O
, O
you O
might O
like O
to O
use O
the O
sleeve O
by O
placing O
it O
inside O
another O
bag O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
stuff O
, O
and O
the O
strap O
would O
be O
in O
the O
way O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
a O
bit O
smaller O
than O
a O
full O

size O
keyboard O
but O
I O
was O
quickly O
able O
to O
adjust O

one O
on O

gets O
dirty O
pretty O
fast O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
hot O
to O
clean O
it O
without O
damaging O
it O
. O

It O
charges O
quickly O
and O
seems O
to O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

After O
thinking O
about O
why O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
do O
you O
really O
want O
to O
be O
staring O
at O
your O
monitor O
for O
a O
long O
time O
in O
low O
lighting O
? O

However O
exchange O
for O
a O
new O
one O
went O
flawlessly O
. O

I O
also O
bought O
the O
recommended O
battery O
and O
for O
the O
two O
items O
approx O
35 O

However O
the O
second O
day O

had O
it O
, O
he O
keyboard O
fell O
right O
out O

This O

works O
great O
for O

and O
pics O
to O
your O

for O
use O
in O
your O
smart O

. O

The O
blacks O
are O
deliciously O
deep O
. O

I O
have O
experienced O
dropouts O
with O
, O
much O
cheaper O
, O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
, O

. O

I O
chose O
this O
rating O
because O
it O
works O
excellent O
and O
like O
the O
original O
one O
. O

Making O

is O
a O
breeze O
. O

and O
you O
are O
ready O
to O
go O
again O
- O
no O
deterioration O
in O
effectiveness O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
keeping O
the O
cooler O
since O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
too O
much O
of O
an O
overheating O
problem O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
but O
if O
my O
laptop O
ran O
hotter O
I O
'd O
definitely O
return O
this O
. O

I O
read O
some O
people O
mentioning O
that O
the O
battery O
does O
not O
charge O
up O
to O
the O
mAh O
rating O
stated O
by O
the O
item O
description O
. O

Have O
n't O
done O
any O
kind O
of O
real O

world O
testing O
just O
yet O
, O
but O
it O
's O
lasting O
more O
than O
5mins O
which O
is O
more O
than O
I O
can O
say O
for O
the O
old O
one O
! O

Would O
recommend O
to O
friends O
and O
family O
. O

I O
had O
already O
put O
up O
a O
mount O
and O
run O
the O
coax O
cable O
to O
it O
. O

Overall O
though O
, O
its O
really O
good O
for O
a O
laptop O
, O
you O
can O
watch O

and O
play O
games O
and O
you O
do O
nt O
have O
to O
turn O

up O

but O
then O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
ANY O
touch O
pad O

if O
not O
then O
replace O
with O
this O
great O
part O
it O
is O
n't O
the O
top O
of O
the O
line O
but O
worked O
perfect O
and O
came O
super O
fast O

I O
carry O
one O
for O
my O
iPhone O
, O

and O
cables O
, O
a O
portable O

backup O
power O

and O
other O
assorted O
attachments O
. O

I O
took O
a O
chance O
and O
it O
did O
not O
pay O
off O
. O

This O
should O
be O
sold O
in O
a O
package O
with O
the O
IPAD O
Mini O
-After O
you O
use O
it O
- O
you O
wonder O
why O
Apple O
does O
n't O
offer O
it O
-Easy O
to O
use O
and O
comfortable O
keyboard O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
good O
. O

Yes O
, O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
fans O
slightly O
but O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
at O
all O
for O
me O
. O

Once O
you O
've O
done O
that O
you O
're O
good O
to O
go O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
the O
extender O
will O
read O
" O
limited O
/ O
no O

just O
installed O
one O
for O
my O
boss O
to O
work O
with O
his O
TIVO O
which O
was O
only O
getting O
about O
58 O
% O
-65 O
% O
signal O
strength O
. O

But O
for O
movies O
with O
a O
1 O
. O
85 O
aspect O
ratio O
, O
they O
should O
fill O
this O
screen O
. O

Shipping O
was O
fast O
. O

and O
it O
was O
already O
below O
50 O
percent O
. O

I O
was O
replacing O
a O
broken O
laptop O
and O
had O
lost O
enough O
productivity O
without O
adding O
the O
learning O
curve O
to O
the O
issue O
! O

( O
you O
have O
to O
unplug O
the O
cord O
or O
turn O
the O
volume O
down O
) O
. O

Yea O
it O
is O
a O
small O
Bluetooth O
keyboard O
that O
works O
like O
it O
says O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
use O
these O
to O
make O
phone O
calls O
, O
and O
to O
do O
VOIP O
during O
multiplayer O
gaming O
. O

Finally O
got O
some O
functionality O
in O

, O
the O
upgrade O
to O

Exactly O
like O
the O

3 O
times O

. O
0 O
ports O
are O
extremely O
helpful O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
that O
machines O
like O
this O
come O
with O
an O
HDMI O
port O
that O
transmit O
audio O
along O
with O

. O

you O
find O
gear O
and O
things O
that O
fall O
easily O
. O

I O
can O
find O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
this O
monitor O
. O

very O
good O
, O
, O
excellent O

It O
has O
a O
very O
small O
form O
factor O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
a O
worry O
when O
you O
use O
your O
computer O

, O
but O
it O
can O
become O
a O

' O
leather O
' O
would O
bulge O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
3-fold O
thickness O
. O

The O
LCD O
screen O
is O
crap O
. O

And O
Barely O
Any O
Warm O
Air O
Coming O
Out O

But O
I O
already O
carry O
a O
couple O
of O
micro O
- O
fiber O
cloths O
when O
I O
travel O
. O

This O
sleeve O
is O
fitting O
my O
Toshiba O
Protege O
like O
a O
glove O
. O

I O
had O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
adapters O
to O
use O
in O
conjunction O
with O
docking O
station O
Plugable O
UD-3000 O
. O

but O
I O
like O
it O
compared O
to O
my O
Dell O
. O

I O
run O
a O
couple O
of O
websites O
and O
own O
a O
book O
review O
site O
, O
and O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
administrative O
work O
that O
has O
me O
tiling O
two O
applications O
side O
by O
side O
on O
my O
monitor O
screen O
, O
so O
being O
able O
to O
use O
a O
split O
screen O
will O
help O
me O
tremendously O
. O

San O
Disk O
's O
tech O
support O
spent O
some O
time O
trying O
to O
help O
. O

Works O
much O
better O
on O
the O
14 O
- O
45 O
mm O
kit O
lens O
than O
the O
original O
OEM O
lens O
cap O
. O

Free O
wireless O
in O
the O
building O
, O
but O
her O
computer O
has O
no O
wireless O
hardware O
. O

But O
ran O
better O
under O
Seven O
. O

It O
does O
work O
as O
expected O
but O
I O
did O
not O
find O
the O
exterior O
walls O
of O
the O
case O
to O
be O
very O
thick O
to O
support O
the O
unit O
as O
you O
carry O
or O
store O
. O

The O
price O
is O
right O
, O
and O
the O
battery O
works O
well O
. O

So O
I O
bought O
this O
from O
another O
website O
because O
i O
wanted O
more O
costumizationsAnd O

However O
, O
I O
find O
myself O
hitting O
the O
trackpad O
constantly O
, O
shrinking O
my O
Outlook O
windows O
or O
typing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
some O
paragraph O
I O
had O
already O
started O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
glitch O
on O
the O
net O
its O
not O
the O
computer O
but O
the O
browser O
. O

It O
fits O
very O
snuggly O
andprovides O
a O
non O
- O
skid O
surface O
. O

Does O
the O
company O
care O
to O
make O
things O
right O
or O
do O
they O
tell O
you O
to O
take O
a O
hike O
? O

The O
Presenter O
mouse O
is O
a O
full O
- O
fledged O
bluetooth O
Powerpoint O
presenter O
with O
a O
60-ft O
range O
. O

If O
you O
do O
decide O
to O
purchase O
this O
camera O
, O
be O
prepared O
for O
a O
fairly O
lengthy O
installation O
. O

However O
, O
this O
model O
is O
designed O
so O
that O
with O
or O
without O
the O
fan O
running O
, O
it O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
from O
warming O
up O
. O

My O
Mac O
fits O
inside O
it O
perfectly O
and O
it O
provides O
the O
ultimate O
protection O
. O

Amazing O
, O
right??Best O
of O
all O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
everything O
is O
well O
protected O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
as O
with O
almost O
all O
such O
speaker O
systems O
, O
the O
specifications O
( O
other O
than O
the O
dimensions O
! O
) O
are O
mostly O
meaningless O
. O

does O
it O
change O
your O
songs O
? O

You O
have O
to O
learn O
it O
as O
you O
go O
. O

I O
thought O
about O
playing O
the O
return O
for O
replacement O
lottery O
until O
I O
got O
a O
working O
unit O
, O
but O
decided O
poor O
initial O
quality O
had O
a O
high O
likelihood O
of O
translating O
into O
poor O
lifetime O
quality O
. O

The O
hardware O
is O
metal O
and O
the O
buckles O
are O
mounted O
on O
swivels O
making O
the O
adjustable O
shoulder O
strap O
very O
functional O
and O
fairly O
comfortable O
. O

knowm O
better O
. O

Thread O
PSU O
cables O
through O
PSU O
opening O
and O
attach O
to O
mobo O
and O
drives O
. O

I O
might O
upgrade O
these O
in O
the O
future O
, O
but O
I O
feel O
for O
the O
price O
, O
size O
and O
form O
factor O
these O
are O
an O
excellent O
buy O
. O

This O
works O
perfectly O
. O

I O
tried O
it O
on O
my O
phone O
, O
and O
at O
first O
it O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
work O
. O

Worked O
decent O
for O
a O
day O
, O
then O
on O
day O
2 O
I O
started O
having O
issues O
with O
it O
dropping O
completely O
and O
not O
responding O
. O

when O
I O
run O
my O
nail O
along O
the O
teeth O
, O
they O
're O
not O
warping O
. O

Very O
superficial O
complaint O
, O
and O
its O
probably O
just O
my O
unit O
. O

I O
saw O
this O
battery O
and O
figured O
for O
$ O
25 O
it O
might O
last O
a O
few O
months O
. O

This O
is O
a O
quality O
PS O
. O

I O
would O
like O
it O
more O
if O
they O
add O
an O
extra O
feature O
of O
adjustable O
height O
to O
this O
one O
. O

Overall O
this O
is O
a O
good O
product O
. O

Good O
packaging O
and O
with O
sufficient O
information O
. O

but O
if O
you O
plan O
on O
pairing O
it O
with O
ear O
buds O
or O
a O
headset O

They O
do O
decrease O
the O
temperature O
a O
bit O
but O
just O
barely O
. O

DSometimes O
requires O
a O
little O
& O
# O
34;nudging&#34 O
; O
to O
open O
. O

The O
fourth O
just O
recently O
failed O
. O

No O
type O
of O
lens O
cleaning O
solution O
or O
microfiber O
cloth O
will O
do O
nearly O
as O
good O
a O
job O
. O

Honestly O
, O
for O
the O
price O
you O
ca O
n't O
really O
beat O
this O
. O

Now O
if O
only O
the O
larger O
antenna O
was O
n't O
the O
size O
of O

vs O

Slids O
right O
into O
my O
shoulder O
bag O
. O

I O
have O
well O
over O
a O
thousand O
dollars O
worth O
of O
audio O
technology O
in O
my O
car O

Finally O
something O
that O
does O
what O
its O
advertised!. O

Still O
in O
one O
piece O
after O
these O
few O
months O
( O
son O
uses O
it O
in O
college O
) O
... O

I O
rest O
my O
case O
, O
THAT O
is O
reality O
with O
the O
1201N O
, O
not O
5 O
hours O
run O
time O
! O

The O
side O
pocket O
is O
roomy O
enough O
for O
a O
travel O
mouse O
and O
the O
charging O
cord O
/ O
brick O
. O

what O
could O
i O
loose O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
bag O
will O
not O
fit O
in O
the O
overhead O
of O
Embraer O
3-seat O
- O
per O
- O
row O
regional O
jets O
. O

Went O
through O
two O
of O
those O
replaceable O
head O
' O
power O
most O
laptop O
' O
power O
adapters O
, O
They O
were O
horrible O
. O

so O
i O
think O
the O
speed O
is O
irrelevant O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
it O
's O
a O
stylish O
, O
durable O
, O
practical O
bag O
and O
I O
'd O
happily O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

It O
is O
very O
well O
made O
and O
looks O
great O
. O

The O
outer O
top O
finish O
is O
almost O
like O
a O
rubber O
/ O
plastic O
and O
not O
a O
fingerprint O
magnet O
like O
my O
HP O
's O
are O
. O

Roll O
up O
excess O
and O
ties O
with O
the O
twist O
tie O
. O

And O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

so O
i O
'm O
staring O
at O
it O
perhaps O
longer O
than O
was O
intended O
by O
asusflash O
video O
playback O

Works O
well O
. O

Bought O
these O
for O
my O
MacBook O

If O
they O
are O
sitting O
next O
to O
you O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
they O
tend O
to O
have O
a O
darkened O
, O
half O
- O
view O
of O
your O
screen O
. O

Making O
a O
phone O
call O
was O
easy O
, O
too O
, O
once O
I O
got O
used O
to O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
controls O
. O

The O
clips O
closest O
to O
the O
screen O
are O
not O
over O
the O
laptop O
, O
so O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
will O
eventualy O
pop O
off O
or O
break O
easily O
. O

Problems O
: O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
my O
lunch O
:( O

love O
the O
bag O
very O
secure O
and O
customizable O
. O

I O
may O
have O
benn O
able O
to O
try O
a O
little O
harder O
and O
make O
it O
work O

It O
has O
seemed O
to O
occasionally O
miss O
a O
click O
when O
I O
press O
down O
on O
it O
, O
though O
. O

This O
battery O
does O
a O
great O
job O
. O

They O
work O
great O
and O
are O
rock O
solid O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
know O
I O
'd O
get O
better O
battery O
life O
if O
I O
ran O
it O
with O
the O
decreased O
screen O
brightness O
on O
the O
power O
- O
save O
video O
card O
. O

The O
pattern O
is O
nice O
. O

Needed O
a O
replacement O
and O
the O
price O
was O
right O
and O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Does O
n't O
charge O
2 O
iPhone O
's O
or O
iPhone O
and O
iPod O
touch O
at O
same O
time O
using O
USB O
ports O

So O
that O
was O
more O
money O
spent O
on O
a O
dream O
. O

Been O
looking O
for O
a O
dock O
for O
a O
MBAir O
even O
before O
I O
bought O
one O
. O

I O
did O
use O
it O
several O
times O
for O
what O
it O
's O
made O
for O
--- O
carrying O
a O
laptop O
and O
iPad O
. O

This O
mouse O
is O
perfect O
with O
the O
retractable O
cord O
. O

It O
converts O
a O
computers O
VGA O
output O
to O
be O
compatible O
with O
an O
HDMI O
video O
input O
for O
your O
wide O

Hope O
you O
found O
this O
review O
helpful O
, O
feel O
free O
to O
leave O
a O
comment O
if O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
! O

Somewhat O
noisy O
, O
but O
not O
that O
bad O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
will O
find O
a O
better O
value O
than O
this O
device O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
attach O
the O
magnetic O
tip O
to O
it O
. O

Browsing O
the O
Google O
store O
, O
I O
see O
that O
there O
are O
hundreds O
and O
hundreds O
of O
Apps O
, O
games O
, O
movies O
, O
and O
songs O
that O
can O
be O
downloaded O
to O
the O
pad O
. O

The O
chassis O
should O
be O
very O
good O
for O
frequent O
travelers O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
Bang O
& O
Olufsen O
system O
sounds O
better O
than O
most O
of O
the O
HP O
Beats O
systems O
. O

NOW O
the O
bad O
and O
why O
I O
'm O
not O
giving O
it O
full O
stars O
. O

the O
AUA-311 O
pen O
holders O
are O
odd O
sized O
and O
do O
nt O
hold O
pens O
very O
well O
... O
loose O
and O
slide O
out O
and O
around O
. O

However O
every O
time O
I O
reboot O
my O
computer O
it O
fails O
to O
recognize O
the O
adapter O

I O
wo O
n't O
feel O
bad O
if O
it O
somehow O
gets O
damaged O
. O

I O
just O
purchased O
the O
Ipad O
3 O
and O
it O
fits O
with O
the O
smart O
cover O
on O
with O
just O
a O
little O
room O
to O
spare O

i O
try O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
years O
before O
upgrading O
stuff O
- O
glad O

Whether O
you O
should O
go O
with O
a O
Mac O
or O
PC O
largely O
depends O
on O
what O
you O
'll O
use O
it O
for O
. O

I O
felt O
those O
cases O
would O
be O
distracting O
to O
hold O
. O

Music O
is O
crisp O
and O
clear O
even O
up O
in O
the O
higher O
volumes O
. O

The O
reason O
I O
like O
this O
adapter O
is O
because O
the O
plastic O
build O
, O
unlike O
cheaply O
build O
ac O
adapters O
, O
does O
n't O
deform O
from O
all O
the O
extensive O
heat O
that O
is O
produced O
from O
within O
the O
adapter O
. O

LOL).I O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
pictures O
of O
my O
kid O
's O
sports O
activities O
. O

There O
's O
really O
not O
much O
more O
to O
say O
than O
that O
in O
regards O
to O
this O
bag O

Also O
very O
happy O
with O
Amazon O
and O
their O
delivery O
people O
who O
delivered O
the O
TV O
in O
1 O
week O
- O
buying O
online O
from O
this O
place O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
local O
store O
was O
definitely O
a O
great O
decision O
given O
the O
significant O
savings O
Amazon O
offers O
. O

Also O
, O
being O
Kepler O
based O
it O
stay O
much O
cooler O
and O
saves O
on O
energy O
than O
some O
of O
its O
counterparts.- O
Excellent O
ventilation O
. O

The O
case O
is O
snug O
but O
not O
too O
tight O
and O
I O
am O
confident O
my O
MBP O
R. O
is O
protected O
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Despite O
rumors O
to O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
Turbo O
Boost O
and O
hyper O
threading O
capabilities O
were O
NOT O
turned O
off O
in O
the O
Core O
i5 O
CPUs O
. O

For O
the O
past O
nine O
months O
the O
HDD O
has O
been O
failing O
off O
and O
on O
. O

Which O
I O
fastened O
to O
my O
Koss O
UR-20 O
Home O
Headphones O
. O

Lots O
of O
padding O
which O
makes O
this O
a O
great O
case O
to O
protect O
my O
laptop O
. O

It O
holds O
my O
Pentax O
K-5 O
with O
18 O
- O
200 O
lens O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
other O
lenses O
, O
my O

. O
4 O
" O
Macbook O

Retina O
, O
and O
all O
the O
necessary O
accessories O
for O
them O
. O

Though O
not O
deal O
breakers O
, O
I O
would O
offer O
the O
following O
constructive O
criticism O
: O
( O
1 O
) O
the O
bag O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
the O
speaker O
plus O
the O
cord O
-- O
it O
's O
always O
a O
tight O
fit O
and O
takes O
effort O
to O
get O
both O
into O
the O
bag O
, O
but O
, O
having O
the O
bag O
is O
very O
nice O
; O
( O
2 O
) O
it O
would O
be O
cool O
if O
the O
speaker O
had O
its O
own O
short O
( O
for O
example O
, O
8 O
inches O
or O
so O
) O
cable O
that O
wrapped O
up O
neatly O
as O
part O
of O
the O
speaker O
so O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
take O
the O
long O
, O
bulky O
power O
cord O
along O
unless O
you O
knew O
you O
'd O
need O
to O
recharge O
the O
speaker O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
good O
, O
but O
perhaps O
just O
a O
little O
more O
resolution O
and O
brightness O
would O
be O
added O
benefits O
( O
I O
like O
a O
very O
bright O
screen).Performance O
and O
speed O
are O
excellent O
. O

I O
'm O
running O
a O

and O
have O
RoadRunner O

modem O
service O
( O
Toshiba O

) O
. O

Plug O
into O
your O

then O
I O
found O
a O
deal O
on O
the O
i5 O
. O

Artificial O
Intelligence O
15 O
bag O
. O

Fit O
screen O
very O
well O

easy O
to O

Protect O

6).I O
did O
some O
minor O
improvements O
to O
this O
pc O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
( O
like O
swapping O
the O
harddrive O
for O
SSD O
and O
upgrading O
the O
RAM O
from O
4 O
gb O
to O
8) O
, O
but O
that O
only O
cause O
I O
ca O
n't O
have O
anything O
without O
personalizing O
it O
. O

Nothing O
, O
nada O
. O

If O
you O
have O
not O
visited O
the O
avsforums O
, O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
read O
through O
the O
entire O
owner O
's O
thread O
for O
this O
TV O
. O

The O
reception O
is O
strangely O
unpredictable O
, O
at O
times O
dropping O
out O
only O
several O
feet O
away O
from O
the O

at O

thirty O
feet O
or O
so O
and O
separated O
by O
a O
floor O
or O
wall O
. O

Definitely O
met O
expectations O
here O
when O
listening O
to O
music O
. O

I O
used O
the O
previous O
GBU421 O
adapter O
and O
loved O
it O
, O
but O
I O
accidentally O
broke O
it O
. O

just O
in O
case O
you O
have O
the O
whim O
to O
try O
an O
alternative O
color O
. O

Overall O
, O
You O
will O
not O
go O
wrong O
buying O
this O
set O
. O

Compaq O
Presario O
laptop O
and O
linked O
to O
my O
Linksys O
WRT54GX4 O
router O
. O

Feel O
free O
to O
offer O
your O
opinion O
. O

I O
was O
concerned O
without O
actually O
seeing O
this O
case O
that O
it O
might O
be O
to O
bulky O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
very O
sleek O
, O
somewhat O
heavy O
for O
its O
size O
( O
the O
battery O
probably O
makes O
up O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
the O
weight O
gain O
) O
, O
and O
the O
Windows O
7 O
is O
usable O
. O

Received O
item O
just O
as O
expected O
from O
description O
write O
- O
up O
. O

Other O
cable O
brands O
- O
especially O
from O
big O
box O
stores O
- O
can O
run O
at O
$ O
40 O
and O
above O
. O

Somethings O
were O
different O
in O
making O
the O
transfer O
.. O
but O
lets O
go O
over O
some O
things O
for O
those O
not O
to O
savvy O
with O
computers O
. O

I O
love O
their O
product O
line O
and O
in O
- O
fact O
have O
a O
few O
of O
these O
for O
the O
new O
unibody O
designs O
as O
well O
. O

I O
muse O
this O
to O
connecy O
my O
Acer O
to O
a O
repeater O
to O
allow O
us O
to O
maintain O
the O
program O
in O
the O
remote O
unit O
. O

but O
the O
quality O
of O
this O
unit O
and O
the O
service O
is O
much O
lower O
then O
any O
other O
computer O
I O
ever O
had O
. O

, O
I O
lost O
them O
all O
though O
:-( O

Look O
for O
the O
cases O
that O
are O
waterproof O
if O
you O
want O
a O
complement O
to O
your O
leather O
case O
, O
and O
pass O
on O
this O
one O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
and O
nice O
looking O
. O

Gave O
up O
and O
reinstalled O
original O
512 O
mb O
chip O
. O

Great O
price O
and O
fast O
shipping O
. O

but O
I O
put O
a O
book O
over O
it O

I O
liked O
my O
netbook O
, O
but O
I O
LOVE O
this O
laptop O
. O

So O
far O
i O
've O
found O
no O
negatives O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
pouches O
are O
n't O
obtrusive O
and O
lay O
fairly O
flush O
against O
the O
inside O
, O
so O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
use O
them O
, O
you O
barely O
notice O
they O
are O
there O
. O

Occassionally O
, O
the O
mousepad O
will O
just O
turn O
off O
completely O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
rate O
this O
battery O
. O

MOBO O
header O

If O
you O
are O
n't O
up O
for O
prying O
the O
device O
open O
, O
pressing O
a O
& O
# O
34;reset&#34 O
; O
that O
is O
hard O
to O
identify O
, O
and O
downloading O
software O
to O
your O
PC O
that O
is O
all O
in O
foreign O
language O
, O
no O
English O
, O
in O
order O
to O
reload O
software O
on O
the O
device O
, O
then O
you O
should O
save O
your O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
Chromebox O
. O

and O
it O
's O
even O
faster O
. O

( O
You O
may O
not O
think O
this O
is O
huge O
, O
but O
hook O
this O
up O
to O
your O
stereo O
through O
the O
optical O
and O
you O
will O
hear O
a O
major O
difference O
. O

This O
is O
relevant O
because O
IPS O
is O
known O
for O

So O
, O
not O
only O
was O
the O
new O
key O
setup O
getting O
me O
killed O
, O
my O
ability O
to O
kill O
really O
dwindled O
and O
that O
got O
me O
killed O
. O

That O
's O
when O
I O
found O
this O
Belkin O
1 O
Outlet O
Surge O
Protector O
with O
a O
2 O
. O
1 O
Amp O
USB O
Port O
. O

is O
a O
nice O
chicklet O
- O
style O
keyboard O
, O
but O
the O
' O
end O
' O
of O
the O
stroke O
is O
not O
quite O
as O
refined O
as O
I O
'd O
like O
, O
but O
that O
's O
my O
only O
complaint O
about O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
just O
wish O
it O
would O
push O
my O
files O
and O
around O
faster O
. O

I O
used O
my O
earphones O
while O
I O
did O
housework O
and O
gardening O
, O
and O
the O
cord O
was O
so O
long O
that O
I O
constantly O
had O
to O
tuck O
it O
into O
my O
waistband O
or O
pockets O
, O
where O
it O
would O
escape O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

I O
got O
mine O
for O
around O
$ O
950 O
during O
the O
2013 O
holiday O
season O
. O

Ignore O
the O
one O
- O
star O
whiners O
that O
do O
n't O
even O
own O
the O
thing O
. O

When O
people O
mentioned O
how O
poorly O
this O
laptop O
fared O
against O
other O
laptops O
in O
video O
game O
performance O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
fine O
, O
they O
're O
comparing O
this O
laptop O
with O
the O
newly O
released O
2011 O
15 O
" O
ones O
with O
discrete O
graphics O
chips O
. O

Lot O
of O
the O
bubbles O
that O
you O
think O
are O
permanent O
eventually O
fade O
away O
by O
rubbing O
them O
consistently O
, O
but O
not O
to O
rough O
, O
as O
to O
move O
the O
air O
towards O
the O
edges O
. O

Cord O
itself O
seemed O
thick O
and O
durable O
. O

so O
I O
'd O
appreciate O
if O
someone O
would O
tell O
me O
if O
there O
is O
a O
trick O
to O
it O
. O

They O
both O
arrived O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
To O
be O
honest O
, O
if O
both O
brands O
put O
their O
heads O
together O
, O
they O
would O
make O
an O
EXCELLENT O
keyboard O
case O
, O
separately O
, O
they O
are O
merely O
adequate O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
buy O
spurs O
for O
a O
nag O
. O

For O
the O
low O
price O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
. O

This O
laptop O
uses O
the O
Intel O
integrated O
Graphics O
Media O
Accelerator O
4500MHD O
, O
which O
has O
no O
dedicated O
memory O

Check O
out O
the O
Picture O

I O
added O

So O
far O
I O
love O
it O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
instructions O
for O
using O
the O
keyboard O
are O
good O
quality O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
specific O
to O
this O
Samsung O
, O
it O
's O
true O
of O
most O

Again O

After O

As O
one O
other O
reviewer O
mentioned O
, O
most O
( O
if O
not O
all O
) O
the O
reviews O
on O
here O
are O
for O
a O
completely O
different O
item O
, O
a O
giant O
backpack O
that O
has O
little O
in O
common O
with O
the O

Once O
I O
found O
out O
how O
to O
use O
it O
, O
by O
experimenting O
with O
it O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

Keyboard O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
over O
the O
one O
that O
's O
built O
in O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
still O
using O
it O
on O
its O
default O
settings O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
charge O
, O
and O
has O
been O
a O
great O
help O
with O
my O

INCREDIBLE O

The O
card O
does O
n't O
seat O
completely O
flush O
like O
some O
others O
have O
mentioned O
but O
I O
will O
say O
its O
miniscule O
less O
than O
a O
16th O
of O
an O
inch O
. O

The O
battery O
lasts O
just O
over O
3 O
hours O
in O
my O
D600 O
using O
CrunchBang O
Linux O
, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
than O
my O
original O
battery O
( O
it O
should O
last O
just O
as O
long O
in O
Windows O
XP O
. O
) O

By O
design O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
for O
when O
you O
are O
traveling O
light O
, O
and O
that O
's O
one O
thing O

I O
like O
the O
extra O
buttons O
on O
the O
VX O
Revolution O
and O
switch O
to O
that O
when O
I O
need O
the O
extra O
functions O
, O
but O
for O
extended O
use O
, O
it O
is O
less O
comfortable O
since O
it O
has O
a O
higher O
bulge O
profile O
that O
pressures O
my O
palm O
, O
and O
the O
need O
to O
hold O
it O
. O

He O
has O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
, O
and O
loves O
it O

I O

I O

it O

This O

i O
like O
so O
much O

people O
thought O
I O
was O
carrying O
a O
book O
until O
I O
had O
need O
to O
open O
it O
. O

My O
new O
monitor O
came O
with O
two O
HDMI O
ports O
only O
. O

Add O
2 O
AA O
batteries O

This O
cord O
is O
close O
to O
useless O
because O
it O
slips O
out O
of O
my O
Kindle O
Fire O
. O

First O
we O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
cheap O
it O
was O
. O

ca O
n't O
get O
any O
simpler O
than O
that O
. O

I O
realize O
the O
battery O
will O
not O
be O
removed O
often O
, O
but O
my O
experience O
is O
just O
something O
I O
would O
suggest O
being O
aware O
of O
for O
other O
customers O
. O

One O
6 O
cell O
or O
the O
Samsung O
nc10 O

Note O
that O
I O
used O
a O
MacBook O
with O
the O
matte O
screen O
option O
for O
this O
comparison O
. O

Good O
thick O
cords O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
disappointing O
is O
the O
wireless O
range O
. O

And O
that O
's O
a O
load O
of O
B. O
S. O
Reality O

It O
's O
not O
meant O
to O
take O
hard O
drops O
( O
neither O
are O
laptop O
hard O
drives O
) O
, O
just O
to O
keep O
it O
clean O
and O
unscratched O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
good O
luck O
. O

then O
do O
whatever O
else O
you O
want O
. O

This O
cable O
gives O
one O
the O
ability O
to O
transfer O
audio O
and O
video O
in O
one O
cable O
. O

Replace O
the O
battery O
, O
it O
falls O
out O
again O
. O

the O
2 O
gb O
that O
came O
with O
my O
camera O
holds O
about O
35 O
minutes O
of O
video O
, O
and O
about O
1200 O
photos O
.. O

Bottom O
line O
: O

Whether O
or O
not O
it O
's O
too O
loud O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
and O
for O
me O
, O
it O
's O
not O
. O

The O
feet O
on O
the O
bottom O
are O
just O
the O
right O
kind O
of O
rubber O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
Asus O
Eee O
netbook O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
now O
. O

Able O
to O
do O
virtual O
OS O
things O
fairly O
well O
on O
the O
1215B O
with O
8 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
too O
but O
sound O
driver O
issues O
in O
virtual O
OS O
mode O
or O
trying O
to O
dual O
boot O
it O
to O
another O
OS O
has O
been O
quirky O
. O

On O
examination O
, O
the O
pockets O
are O
numerous O
and O
well O
thought O
out O
. O

To O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
; O
it O
's O
not O
bad O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
positive O
reviews O
were O
spot O
on O
. O

Use O
it O
at O
work O
mostly O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
champion O
! O

They O
're O
computer O
speakers O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
product O
works O
fine O
for O
both O
my O
PCs O
. O

After O
looking O
online O
at O
netbooks O
we O
decided O
that O
battery O
life O
and O
the O
10 O
. O
2 O
inch O
screen O
size O
were O
important O
. O

Eventually O
software O
makers O
will O
remedy O
this O
problem O
, O
but O
for O
now O
, O
it O
limits O
ease O
of O
use O
. O

6 O
Inspiron O
, O
its O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
. O

My O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
since O
it O
is O
not O
OEM O
product O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
fit O
perfectly O
in O
the O
laptop O
and O
wiggles O
a O
bit O
, O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
unexpected O
shut O
down O
. O

If O
the O
hub O
is O
plugged O
in O
, O
the O
PC O
will O
not O
boot O
-- O
hangs O
at O
the O
Dell O
logo O
screen O
. O

after O
moving O
around O
the O
macbook O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
shift O
off O
from O
the O
keyboard O
itself O
like O
the O
MOSHI O
does O
. O

Last O
one O
broke O
down O
on O
me O
within O
a O
months O
return O
period O
. O

I O
did O
remove O
the O
black O
skin O
and O
replace O
it O
with O
the O
green O
one O
, O
but O
it O
takes O
a O
bit O
of O
effort O
, O
so O
I O
doubt O
if O
anyone O
would O
want O
to O
change O
the O
skins O
regularly O
. O

The O
screen O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
quite O
match O
my O
previous O
HP O
in O
color O
or O
brightness O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
very O
good O
. O

First O
thing O
I O
noticed O
with O
WoW O
is O
the O
high O
- O
res O
screen O
make O
the O
game O
look O
so O
sharp O
and O
vibrant O

Overall O
though O
, O
it O
works O
well O
enough O
to O
watch O
youtube O
or O
short O
clips O
. O

Speakerphone O
quality O
is O
better O
than O
most O
bluetooth O
devices O
I O
've O
heard O
. O

More O
truthfully O
, O
it O
is O
a O
( O
large O
) O
software O
suite O
connected O
to O
a O
big O
volume O
knob O
. O

Tested O
on O
Motorola O
's O
Blackberry O
, O
Samsung O
Note O
2 O
, O
and O
Apple O
Iphone5 O
. O

I O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
not O
reading O
the O
comments O
first O
and O
only O
thought O
about O
it O
after O
over O
a O
month O
of O
waiting O
. O

The O
interior O
is O
just O
too O
big O
for O
it O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
Mac O
. O

i O
replaced O
my O
Macbook O
pro O
CD O
drive O
with O
" O
500 O
GB O
Hard O
Drive O
with O

We O
've O
got O
it O
on O
a O
stand O
right O
now O
, O
but O
will O
be O
buying O
thePeerless O
PA740 O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
so O
many O
compartments O
. O

This O
older O
laptop O
arrived O
with O
a O
replaced O
E O
key O
, O
and O
a O
small O
spot O
of O
fingernail O
polish O
barely O
noticeable O

Explicitly O
supported O
my O
printer O
. O

We O
Skyped O
over O
Christmas O
so O
she O
could O
see O
her O
grandchildren O
, O
in O
CA O
, O
unwrap O
presents O

But O
, O
you O
haveto O
think O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
leave O
your O
computer O
out O
of O
it O
. O

it O
's O
a O
great O
way O
to O
re O
- O
purpose O
a O
Xoom O
as O
a O
music O
player O
. O

You O
can O
use O
the O
same O
charger O
that O
you O
use O
if O
you O
have O
an O
iPhone O
, O
which O
i O
love O
. O

Perfect O
for O
long O
trips O
in O
the O
car O
or O
on O
a O
plane O
. O

Very O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
. O

This O
has O
taken O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
for O
me O

My O
battery O
is O
NOT O
a O
nokia O
- O

but O
it O
works O
well O
for O
me O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
and O
works O
well O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

It O
was O
very O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
use O
one O
of O
these O
drives O
on O
my O
PS3 O
and O
the O
other O
to O
back O
up O
my O
MacBookPro O
. O

Is O
n't O
it O
a O
clue O
when O
your O
unsupported O
list O
is O
larger O
than O
your O
supported O
list O
? O

Have O
everything O
i O
need O
in O
case O
i O
have O
to O
carry O
my O
laptop O
or O
ipad O
or O
any O
other O
gadget O
that O
i O
have O

and O
I O
would O
have O
been O
stuck O
with O
Bluetooth O
2 O
. O
1 O
. O

It O
is O
going O
back O
to O
Amazon O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
a O
router O
upgrade O
will O
help O
since O
the O
connection O
is O
direct O
, O
not O
via O
the O
home O
network O
, O
if O
I O
understand O
correctly O
. O

The O
adapter O
does O
as O
per O
the O
product O
specs O
and O
has O
not O
broken O
down O
yet O
for O
me O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
if O
it O
holds O
up O
. O

Includes O
reduced O
functionality O
versions O
of O
Microsoft O
Word O
and O
Excel O
, O
with O
advertising O
. O

The O
" O
woofer O
" O
opening O
is O
out O
the O
back O
( O
sending O
the O
sound O
away O
from O
the O
user O
) O
and O
measures O
about O
5/8 O
" O
in O
diameter O
... O
not O
really O
large O
enough O
to O
allow O
significant O
room O
for O
the O
sound O
wave O
. O

But O
one O
person O
's O
whisper O
is O
another O
person O
's O
shout O
, O
so O
there O
you O
go O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
perfect O
and O
hats O
saying O
a O
lot O
considering O
how O
great O
their O
products O
are O
already O
. O

I O
chose O
the O
Altec O
Lansings O
over O
the O
Logitech O
and O
other O
offerings O
based O
on O
my O
outstanding O
experience O
with O
AL O
's O
iphone O
/ O
ipod O
docking O
station O
. O

It O
does O
not O
transport O
loose O
papers O
very O
well O
if O
you O
have O
other O
items O
in O
the O
bag O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
distort O
the O
dividers O
. O

I O
looked O
for O
various O
computer O
lap O
pads O
for O
a O
month O
before O
buying O
this O
one O
. O

The O
wireless O
card O
was O
simple O
to O
install O
, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
20 O
+ O
years O
of O
hands O
- O
on O
experience O
installing O
modems O
, O
sound O
cards O
and O
network O
cards O
. O

any O
settings.)The O
USB O
wireless O
connection O
is O
wonderfully O
small O
... O
about O
1/2 O
" O
x O
3/4 O
" O
and O
does O
clip O
easily O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
mouse O
( O
in O
spite O
of O
what O
some O
people O
have O
reported O
. O

What O
I O
would O
have O
to O
way O
is O
this O
products O
Saving O
grace O
is O
the O
seller O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
little O
cord O
to O
see O
if O
could O
charge O
my O
Nexus O
7 O
faster O
. O

Windows O
8 O
is O
a O
mess O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
Acer O
's O
fault O
. O

My O
wife O
accesses O
this O
from O
her O
work O
- O
nice O
feature O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
case O
. O

There O
is O
a O
flip O
out O
USP O
connector O
which O
easily O
plugs O
into O
your O
computer O
for O
charging O
and O
uploading O
purposes O
. O

Pro O
USB O
Audio O
System O
with O
THX O
SB1290 O
. O

Ubuntu O
works O
flawlessly O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
boot O
with O
the O
new O
Intel O
card O
, O
Win O
8 O
is O
a O
real O
headache O
as O
all O
Windows O
systems O
are O
. O

This O
may O
be O
more O
preference O
than O
anything O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
comment O
shared O
by O
many O
. O

It O
's O
for O
someone O
who O
already O
has O
Mac O
tech O
somewhere O
else O
in O
their O
life O
and O
want O
a O
pricey O
, O
portable O
addition O
to O
that O
tech O
. O

I O
am O
using O
the O
batteries O
to O
power O
it O
( O
it O
is O
available O
with O
a O
few O
more O
options O
) O
and O
it O
is O
behind O
my O
television O
. O

This O
mouse O
is O
good O
for O
when O
you O
are O
on O
the O
go O
. O

so O
i O
set O
my O
PS3 O
to O
1080p O
in O
the O
display O
options O
menu O
thinking O
the O
screen O
would O
just O
go O
black O
or O
blank O
or O
would O
say O
" O
mode O
not O
supported O
" O
but O

Wegner O
should O
list O
it O
as O
New O
Old O
Stock O
and O
be O
honest O
about O
their O
description O
. O

My O
gaming O
/ O
computer O
station O
has O
never O
looked O
so O
good O
before O
until O
i O
got O
these O
. O

Super O
easy O
to O
instal O
, O
just O
put O
in O
the O
CD O
, O
followed O
the O
directions O
and O
I O
was O
up O
and O
running O
in O
a O
few O
short O
minutes O
. O

, O
it O
is O
much O
longer O
than O
the O
original O
charger O
and O
adapter O

This O
is O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
because O
I O
can O
use O
the O
software O
to O
use O
remote O
to O
open O
Front O
Row O
, O
iTunes O
, O
QuickTime O
and O
other O
programs O
I O
choose O
. O

but O
we O
will O
see O
how O
long O
the O
wire O
lasts O
it O
seems O
kind O
of O
flimsy O
and O
there O
is O
no O
place O
on O
the O
case O
to O
store O
the O
wire O
to O
protect O
it O
when O
its O
not O
in O
use O

Forget O
what O
the O
customer O
thinks O
as O
long O
as O
he O
or O
she O
is O
dishing O
out O
the O
dough O
. O

The O
OS O
checks O
for O
updates O
for O
you O
, O
so O
for O
better O
or O
worse O
you O
just O
get O
notifications O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
protect O
my O
Kindle O
while O
I O
was O
deployed O
in O
Afghanistan O
with O
the O
Army O
. O

also O
it O
charges O
far O
slower O
. O

The O
best O
part O
is O
the O
picture O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
time O
learning O
the O
Windows O
8 O
operating O
system O
. O

IF O
ANYONE O
has O
ANY O
issues O
with O
this O
laptop O
.. O
simply O
go O
to O
notebookreview O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
that O
storage O
is O
the O
area O
above O
it O
. O

Lighter O
than O
it O
looks O
. O

It O
should O
retail O
for O
much O
less O
since O
it O
is O
just O
another O
knock O
- O
off O
from O
China O
. O

so O
I O
'll O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

Bass O
and O
highs O
over O
mids O
. O

They O
are O
including O
the O
netbook O
sleeves O
with O
these O
products O
on O
amazon- O

In O
a O
year O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
if O
it O
is O
still O
alive O
:) O
. O

Gave O
it O
a O
third O
try O
and O
ordered O
another O
one O
. O

protect O
my O
mac O
book O

My O
friend O
suggested O
it O
to O
me O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
's O
what O
it O
's O
been O
designed O
for O
. O

Worse O
, O
the O
device O
is O
a O
potential O
fire O
and O
electrocution O
hazard O
. O

Seems O
that O
all O
netbooks O
are O
nearly O
the O
same O
hardware O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Without O
this O
device O
and O
a O
usb O
wireless O
adapter O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
successfully O
use O
my O
Dell O
Venue O
8 O
pro O
without O
constantly O
having O
to O
reboot O
to O
fix O
its O
wireless O
problems O
. O

I O
'm O
guessing O
this O
happens O
because O
the O
convertor O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
built O
- O
in O
' O
hardware O
video O
scaler O
' O
, O
so O

Hence O
4 O
stars O
and O
not O
5 O
. O

If O
I O
could O
rate O
this O
product O
10 O
stars O
, O
I O
would O
! O

are O
no O
connections O
on O
the O
back O
edge O
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
be O
buying O
asus O
again O
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser O
, O
the O
Asus O
offers O
the O
option O
of O
rendering O
web O
pages O
like O
a O
desktop O
computer O
, O
which O
works O
beautifully O
. O

Transfering O
my O
files O
over O
from O
my O
old O
computer O
was O
no O
problem O
. O

and O
I O
love O
it O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
my O
original O
charger O
. O

third O
, O
having O
7 O
usb O
slots O
is O
just O
fantastic O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
that O
anything O
I O
did O
would O
've O
taxed O
the O
computer O
very O
much O
. O

I O
had O
been O
on O
the O
fence O
between O
just O
the O
pen O
tablet O
, O
instead O
of O
this O
combo O
. O

good O
product O
support O
a O
lot O
of O
scracth O
its O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
remove O
it O
, O
the O
material O
constructions O
feels O
hard O
but O
is O
practice O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
mine O
several O
hours O
per O
day O

No O
matter O
the O
weight O
fits O
very O
good O
on O
your O
back O
and O
you O
can O
not O
fill O
the O
weight O
. O

It O
still O
works O
, O
however O
, O
it O
" O
goes O
to O
sleep O
" O
to O
soon O
causing O
the O
first O
letter O
of O
what O
you O
are O
typing O
to O
be O
ignored O
until O
it O
wakes O
up O
if O
you O
pause O
to O

something O
else O

A O

Lenovo O

comes O
in O

The O
G6 O
Pro O
holds O
your O

in O
the O
vertical O
with O
two O
plastic O
" O
arms O
" O
at O
the O
top O
and O
the O
bottom O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
they O
did O
not O
include O
hibernation O
support O
. O

The O
power O
button O
does O
n't O
even O
work O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
had O
to O
uninstall O
Adobe O

( O
uses O

and O
install O
Foxit O

Enemy O

at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
recording O
in O
1080p O
it O
gives O
me O
a O
lower O
and O
unstable O
framerate O
, O
as O
expected O
with O
an O
AMD O
Phenom O
II O

I O
'm O
a O
systems O
engineer O
and O
I O
use O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
do O
simple O
administrative O
tasks O
to O
send O
email O
, O
browse O
the O
internet O
, O
read O
ebooks O
and O
write O
documents O
. O

Excellent O
value O
earphones O
with O
a O
sound O
much O
bigger O
than O
the O
price O
tag O
! O

So O
other O
than O
that O
little O
glitch O
, O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
little O
mic O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
backpack O
comes O
with O
a O
waist O
strap O
and O
a O
chest O
strap O
and O
is O
n't O
pretty O
comfortable O
. O

The O
original O
power O
supply O
from O
Dell O
still O
works O
fine O
. O

Then O
it O
just O
stopped O
working O
all O
together O
2 O
months O
later O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
minor O
issues O
, O
but O
overall O
it O
is O
really O
great O
for O
the O
price O
. O

They O
are O
selling O
at O
different O
prices O
and O
the O
prices O
fluctuate O
so O
you O
will O
definitely O
want O
to O
watch O
them O
carefully O
. O

But O
as O
it O
is O
, O
it O
is O
just O
not O
a O
compelling O
buy O
. O

A O
nice O
PSU O
, O
using O
it O
to O
power O
a O
game O
rig O
. O

I O
just O
got O
mine O
and O
have O
not O
gotten O
a O
good O
look O
at O
it O
yet O
-- O
because O
it O
's O
hanging O
there O
behind O
my O
laptop O
monitor O
, O
completely O
out O
of O
my O
way O
. O

Installed O
this O
last O
week O
and O
so O
far O
no O
problems O
. O

No O
backlight O
on O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
had O
a O
tech O
come O
out O

But O
it O
charges O
fine O
, O
is O
stable O
enough O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
some O
little O
bump O
knocking O
over O
the O
tablet O
. O

So O
I O
elected O
this O
baby O
at O
discount O
and O
the O
set O
- O
up O
was O
seamless O
- O
after O
all O
, O
they O
're O
making O
them O
to O
go O
together O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
my O
old O
cord- O

Almost O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
months O
later O
I O
regret O
nothing O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
holiday O
rush O
, O
Amazon O
and O
the O
USPS O
got O
it O
delivered O
to O
my O
home O
in O
four O
days O
. O

And O
again O
the O
trade O
- O
off O
to O
rapid O
installation O
is O
no O
additional O
software O
to O
zoom O
, O
adjust O
resolution O
, O
make O
small O
scene O
adjustments O
, O
and O
focus O
. O

Speeds O
are O
slightly O
faster O
via O
this O
adapter O
than O
using O
my O
Netgear O
Powerline O
Ethernet O
adapter O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
noise O
it O
can O
make O
- O
a O
very O
soft O
, O
high O
frequency O
noise O
. O

But O
Windows O
, O
just O
the O
fact O
its O
turned O
on O
will O
turn O
the O
computer O
into O
a O
molten O
piece O
of O
metal O
. O

Screen O
resolution O
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
boots O
up O
fast O
and O
keyboard O
is O
plenty O
big O
! O

So O
if O
you O
drop O
your O
laptop O
on O
it O
's O
edge O
, O
there O
is O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
protection O
, O
but O
dropping O
something O
on O
the O
flat O
parts O
wo O
n't O
go O
over O
well O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
no O
laptop O
case O
will O
protect O
against O
dropping O
heavy O
objects O
on O
the O
flat O
parts O
unless O
you O
get O
a O
hard O
case O
. O

Works O
great O
with O
my O
Compaq O
laptop O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
last O
year O
after O
much O
research O
. O

The O
instruction O
sheet O
is O
very O
vague O
& O
limited O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
it O
has O
held O
up O
quite O
well O
. O

So O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
now O
what O
is O
wrong O
. O

The O
drivers O
work O
with O
Windows O
Server O
2008 O
as O
well O
. O

But O
for O
her O
and O
people O
like O
her O
, O
it O
is O
a O
perfect O
solution O
. O

Now O
the O
product O
it O
self O
feels O
cheap O
but O
it O
is O
solid O
. O

Laptop O
tells O
me O
it O
has O
26 O
% O
power O
. O

The O
other O
bag O
on O
my O
short O
list O
was O
the O
Tumi O
small O
cordura O
brief O
. O

and O
I O
also O
picked O
upAGPtek O
7200mAh O
Laptop O
Battery O

One O
thing O

I O
could O
n't O
stand O
using O
her O
laptop O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
hardware O
, O
this O
is O
way O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
laptop O
. O

They O
look O
AWESOME O
, O
have O
cool O
touch O
- O
panel O
controls O
and O
are O
easy O
to O
setup O
. O

this O
isnot O
only O
MY O
opinion O

Vista O
cleaned O
up O
? O
) O
, O
pretty O
nice O
speakers O
* O
, O
long O
battery O
life O
( O
though O
I O
get O
only O
5 O
- O
6 O
hours O
, O

I O
was O
just O
about O
to O
spend O
$ O
130 O
on O
a O
new O
router O
, O
but O
I O
found O
out O
that O
it O
's O
actually O
just O
this O
adapter O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
make O
MBP O
go O
to O
sleep O
. O

This O
one O
failed O
suddenly O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
no O
noise O
coming O
from O
the O
adapter O
, O
and O
it O
allows O
the O
CoolerMaster O
to O
have O
full O
USB O
power O
, O
rather O
than O
simply O
drawing O
from O
the O
built O
- O
in O
laptop O
USB O
power O
source O
. O

Read O
a O
little O
while O
you O
're O
working O
with O
the O
computer O

Recommended O
for O
anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
stylish O
product O
to O
protect O
their O
costly O
investment O
. O

, O
it O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Luckily O
, O
I O
never O
purchased O
this O
camera O
. O

It O
gets O
finger O
prints O
, O
dog O
and O
cat O
hair O
, O
sand O
, O
dust O
, O
glitter O
, O
and O
who O
know O
what O
ever O
else O
I O
have O
come O
across O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
the O
ONE O
accessory O
you O
need O
! O

I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
booster O
, O
since O
it O
has O
not O
resolved O
my O
poor O
cell O
phone O
signal O
issue O
. O

It O
plugged O
in O
via O
USB O
, O
had O
an O
extendable O
or O
retractable O
cord O
, O
and O
a O
little O
scrolly O
wheel O
. O

I O
'm O
no O
expert O
- O
there O
are O
many O
settings O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
at O
all O
- O
but O
I O
did O
remember O
enough O
to O
get O
it O
going O
. O

The O
BAD O
is O
that O
it O
died O
in O
three O
months O
. O

The O
outside O
appearance O
is O
great O
and O
will O
easily O
fit O
in O
almost O
anywhere O
in O
your O
home O
. O

" O
Apple O
, O
they O
may O
have O
had O
a O
much O
better O
product O
, O
one O
that O
actually O
worked O
. O

When O
I O
carefully O
tried O
to O
peel O
it O
off O
, O
it O
ripped O
. O

You O
can O
use O
it O
as O
a O
stand O
for O
your O
iPad O
to O
watch O
movies O
or O
carry O
it O
around O
attached O
to O
your O
iPad O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
. O

I O
bought O
an O
E545 O
which O
does O
not O
have O
a O
mini O
dock O
option O
. O

There O
is O
no O
link O
from O
Toshiba O
's O
' O
expired O
' O
message O
to O
ANY O
help O
for O
end O
users O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
. O

But O
, O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
know O
I O
have O
that O
option O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
37 O
year O
old O
male O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
quite O
fit O
my O
decor O
, O
but O
maybe O
it O
will O
grow O
on O
me O
. O

OK O
, O
so O
I O
reinstalled O
the O
Corsair O
RAM O
and O
played O
with O
it O
ever O
so O
slightly O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
RAM O
got O
all O
the O
way O
in O
and O
next O
boot O
was O
a O
success O
. O

I O
took O
it O
apart O
, O
cleaned O
the O
dust O
off O
the O
fan O
, O
put O
it O
back O
together O
again O
, O
and O
it O
was O
quiet O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
but O
started O
with O
the O
whirring O
noise O
again O
. O

The O
touchpad O
is O
only O
component O
in O
my O
opinion O
that O
is O
not O
up O
to O
par O
due O
to O
infrequent O
freakouts O
with O
two O
- O
finger O
scrolling O
and O
hopefully O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
newer O
drivers O
. O

It O
only O
has O
three O
games O
on O
it O

I O
did O
not O
keep O
it O
long O
enough O
to O
test O
out O
the O
blu O
- O
ray O
dvd O
drive O
, O
or O
other O
features O
, O
other O
than O
wireless O
( O
which O
worked O
great.)Quick O
update O
- O
The O
seller O
was O
terrific O
and O
quickly O
made O
the O
refund O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
backpack O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O

Using O
this O
thing O
makes O
me O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
bought O
a O
different O
laptop O
, O
with O
a O
REAL O
docking O
solution O
that O
can O
run O
two O
screens O
without O
all O
the O
trouble O
. O

That O
aside O
it O
's O
well O
built O
but O
the O
case O
does O
shows O
scrathes O
easily O
and O
even O
though O
it O
has O
the O
new O
tegra O
3 O

It O
works O
, O
but O
mine O
has O
problems O
with O
several O
letters O
. O

If O
you O
use O
your O
laptop O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
stop O
reading O
this O
review O
and O
buy O
this O
item O
now O
. O

Over O
all O
, O
its O
a O
good O
product O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
with O
regular O
use O

but O
it O
's O
managable O
unless O
you O
wanna O

The O
computer O
is O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
house O
I O
could O
n't O
wire O
and O
this O
has O
served O
well O
. O

mouse O
responsiveness O
is O
great O
. O

I O
like O
the O
confortable O
shoulder O
strap O
, O
wide O
and O
long O
enough O
but O
not O
too O
long O
. O

WORK O
VERY O
WELL O
. O

I O
'm O
100 O
% O
satisfied O
and O
could O
suggest O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
owns O
an O
Asus O
g O
- O
series O
laptop O
or O
has O
to O
haul O
around O
more O
than O
one O
machine O
. O

Their O
service O
is O
second O
to O
none O
. O

I O
am O
off O
to O
order O
a O
couple O
more O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
DO O
NOT O
recommend O
this O
device O
at O
all O
. O

I O
have O
a O
tablet O
PC O
, O
interestingly O
it O
works O
even O
for O
tablets O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
Macintosh O
Powerbooks O
for O
the O
last O
eight O
years O
and O
it O
was O
an O
ergonomic O
gem O
. O

Most O
of O
my O
USB O
devices O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
upgraded O
to O
windows O
8 O
. O
1 O
but O
did O
not O
like O
having O
MSN O
email O
control O
my O
computer O

For O
$ O
20 O
, O
it O
's O
a O
steal O
because O
I O
get O
fast O
quality O
internet O
speed O
with O
no O
problems O
at O
all O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
3D O
gamer O
and O
want O
a O
nice O
looking O
, O
sturdy O
, O
portable O
laptop O
without O
most O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
a O
netbook O
, O
then O
the O
answer O
could O
be O
" O
yes O
" O
. O

The O
fit O
is O
correct O
and O
it O
protects O
my O
Air O
from O
small O
impacts O
( O
chair O
arm O
hitting O
it O
while O
on O
desk O
, O
taking O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

Was O
a O
replacement O
as O
the O
old O
one O
died O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
keyboard O
dock O
would O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
him O
to O
do O
his O
school O
work O
. O

As O
noted O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
due O
to O
fractures O
in O
the O
cable O
although O
the O
last O
time O
this O
happened O
it O
may O
have O
been O
the O
USB O
connector O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

Adding O
more O
displays O
should O
not O
cost O
as O
much O
. O

Lenovo O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
include O
a O
lot O
of O
extra O
software O
on O
its O
hard O
drive O
but O
that O
will O
probably O
not O
bother O
most O
people O
. O

Its O
fast O
, O
reliable O
, O
the O
display O
is O
not O
glaring O
, O
sharp O
and O
perfect O
, O
light O
and O
battery O
life O
is O
great O
. O

If O
you O
have O
an O
installation O
disc O
and O
are O
OK O
with O
doing O
a O
clean O
install O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
laptop O
. O

Maybe O
the O
reviewers O
who O
say O
the O
cover O
does O
not O
fit O
their O
MacAir O
have O
the O
cover O
upside O
down O
. O

( O
Amazon O
is O
great O
about O
returns).The O
scroll O
wheel O
is O
the O
best O
of O
the O
Logitech O
line O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
. O

I O
hooked O
my O
smartphone O
to O
my O
computer O
through O
bluetooth O
. O

No O
additional O
accessories O
neededDislikes:- O

Just O
get O
a O
cheap O
pouch O
at O
the O
dollar O
store O
to O
protect O
from O
dust O
, O
or O
do O
what O
I O
did O
and O
stick O
it O
right O
back O
in O
the O
plastic O
sleeve O
it O
was O
packaged O
in O
. O

However O
, O
this O
issue O
is O
diminished O
after O
the O
internal O
crystals O
or O
whatever O
they O
are O
warm O
and O
deform O
. O

It O
's O
a O
snug O
fit O
for O
my O
Dell O
15 O
. O

When O
I O
got O
the O
tablet O
, O
I O
had O
noticed O
a O
small O
scratch O
on O
the O
Gorilla O
Glass O
screen O
in O
the O
upper O
right O
side O
. O

First O
pack O
. O

They O
provided O
a O
replacement O
of O
the O
original O
size O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

but O
that O
's O
kinda O
my O
fault O
since O
I O
did O
n't O
specify O
which O
color O
... O

I O
noticed O
when O
I O
moved O
my O
monitor O
quickly O

I O
've O
never O
had O
the O
misfortune O
of O
a O
slip O
or O
fall O
with O
any O
of O
my O
laptops O
over O
the O
past O
twenty O
( O
20 O
) O
years O
; O
however O
, O
this O
case O
's O
padding O
is O
the O
best O
I O
've O
had O
to O
date O
and O
should O
provide O
as O
much O
laptop O
damage O
protection O
that O
I O
could O
wish O
for O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
mishap O

there O
are O
two O

on O
the O
base O

may O
make O
great O
products O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
first O
thing O
about O
good O
customer O
service O
after O
the O
sale O

The O

( O
not O
here O
, O
not O
on O
their O
website O
, O
and O
not O
on O
the O
box O
they O
came O
in O
) O
, O
but O
it O
was O
acceptable O
to O
me O
( O
I O
am O
used O
to O
listening O
through O
headphones O
with O
a O
response O
of O
10 O
- O
23000 O
, O
for O
comparison O
) O
. O

I O
loved O
the O
length O
and O
toughness O
of O
this O
product O
. O

This O
is O
a O
standard O
size O
wired O
cable O
not O
a O
heavy O
duty O
which O
is O
what O
I O
wanted O
and O
needed O
since O
it O
is O
plug O
in O
all O
the O
time O
and O
not O
moved O
around O
much O
. O

You O
can O
almost O
duplicate O
this O
price O
at O
Amazon O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
to O
use O
this O
product O
yet O
as O
while O
i O
was O
waiting O
for O
this O
product O
to O
arrive O
i O
decided O
to O
perform O
surgery O
on O
my O
charger O
that O
was O
broken O
and O
actually O
got O
it O
working O
pretty O
good O
so O
this O
item O
will O
have O
to O
sit O
and O
collect O
dust O
until O
the O
day O
comes O
that O
the O
original O
finally O
gives O
way O
. O

Obviously O
, O
laptops O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
semi O
- O
portable O
, O
and O
so O
bringing O
a O
monitor O
everywhere O
is O
n't O
practical O
. O

These O
Goja O
cleaning O
clothes O
are O
excellent O
! O

when O
used O
sideways O
( O
landscape O
) O
, O
it O
was O
made O
for O
upright O
( O
portrait O
) O
holding O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
declare O
victory O
yet O
, O
but O
if O
it O
goes O
a O
few O
days O
without O
the O
issues O
, O
I O
'll O
be O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

Everything O
seems O
to O
be O
going O
well O
with O
the O
battery O
. O

I O
have O
the O
blue O
sensor O
light- O

It O
offers O
unlimited O
customization O
for O
all O
my O
gear O
. O

What O
worries O
me O
is O
actual O
time O
before O
the O
battery O
goes O
permanently O
dead O
because O
it O
's O
internal O
and O
doubtful O
that O
it O
will O
be O
something O
you O
can O
pick O
up O
at O
your O
local O
retail O
store O
. O

I O
upgraded O
from O
this O
one O
to O
a O
3200 O
and O
same O
problems O
and O
low O
transmission O
. O

Granted O
, O
the O
price O
is O
high O
for O
RAM O
, O
but O
you O
'd O
pay O
even O
more O
elsewhere O
. O

Amazing O
how O
much O
difference O
a O
simple O
upgrade O
makes O
. O

BUT O
THREE O
TIMES O
! O
! O
! O
? O
? O

Battery O
its O
really O
small O
, O
you O
will O
get O
battery O
life O
like O
3 O
and O
almost O
4 O
hours O
of O
use O
, O
but O
for O
the O
size O
i O
got O
no O
problem O
. O

He O
absolutely O
loves O
drawing O
" O
creatures O
" O
with O
it O
. O

It O
has O
periods O
where O
it O
will O
just O
boot O
me O
off O
the O
internet O
without O
warning O
. O

( O
it O
has O
since O
gone O
up O
in O
price O
) O
, O
so O
I O
jumped O
. O

Afterwards O
I O
copied O
my O
installed O
programs O
back O
onto O
the O
drive O
and O
now O
both O
my O
C:\ O
and O
D:\ O
drives O
are O
healthy O
and O
functioning O
well O
! O

The O
sound O
out O
of O
this O
little O
hideous O
gray O
wafer O
is O
truly O
, O
truly O
unbelievable O
. O

Note O
that O
this O
product O
is O
marketed O
under O
the O
brand O
names O
Aerb O
and O
QQ O
- O
Tech O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
brand O
name O
has O
lots O
of O
very O
mixed O
reviews O
. O

For O
the O
value O
( O
$ O
55 O
) O
I O
probably O
would O
n't O
buy O
it O
again O
, O
but O
overall O
I O
'm O
satisfied O
. O

i O
found O
this O
first O
and O
bought O
it O
. O

When O
the O
CPU O
is O
idle O
and O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
on O
battery O
, O
there O
is O
a O
medium O
to O
high O
pitch O
sound O
that O
emits O
from O
the O
computer O
. O

Battery O
hold O
only O
around O
2 O
hours O
power O
even O
just O
browsing O
. O

The O
speaker O
clamps O
on O
securely O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
obscure O
any O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

Returned O
it O
at O
first O
after O
a O
couple O
weeks O
of O
usage O
because O
the O
sound O
had O
started O
fade O
up O
and O
down O
. O

The O
remote O
I O
was O
provided O
with O
seems O
to O
work O
fine O
, O
but O
there O
's O
a O
significant O
" O
lag O
" O
between O
using O
it O
and O
having O
the O
WinTV O
7 O
software O
respond O
. O

Overall O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
bag O
that O
will O
do O
the O
job O
for O
you O
. O

A O
good O
docking O
station O
is O
one O
of O
the O
two O
reasons O
why O
I O
buy O
Dell O
business O
notebooks O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
a O
little O
short O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
the O
actually O
plug O
was O
an O
& O
# O
34;elbow&#34 O
; O
as O
pictured O
rather O
than O
a O
straight O
. O

The O
last O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
do O
is O
add O
more O
weight O
by O
carrying O
water O
around O
. O

I O
've O
used O
it O
on O
my O
22 O
" O
ASUS O
matte O
monitor O
, O
15 O
" O
glossy O
Dell O
laptop O
, O
and O
32 O
" O
glossy O
Samsung O
TV O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
my O
family O
's O
laptops O
. O

I O
very O
recently O
scored O
a O
2007-vintage O
Lenovo O
T60 O
ThinkPad O
. O

I O
guess O
I O
would O
not O
run O
or O
exercise O
with O
them O
because O
of O
the O
fit O
is O
not O
pressure O
tight O

As O
is O
the O
case O
for O
quite O
a O
few O
mice O
, O
the O
middle O
scroll O
wheel O
also O
doubles O
as O
a O
button O
that O
can O
be O
pressed O
. O

The O
Tripod O
pocket O
and O
straps O
work O
amazingly O
well O
. O

I O
have O
a O
laptop O
desk O
, O
that O
's O
maybe O
, O
2 O
laptops O
in O
width O
( O
a O
big O
Dell O
15 O
" O
laptop O
, O
that O
is O
) O
. O

If O
you O
can O
get O
it O
cheap O
, O
and O
have O
a O
good O
safe O
climate O
controlled O
place O
to O
use O
it O
, O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
good O
little O
device O
. O

5V O
silver O
oxide O
watch O
battery O
will O
work O
, O
and O
you O
buy O
a O
3 O
pack O
for O
$ O
9 O
at O
your O
local O
drugstore O
. O

I O
also O
go O
an O
external O
HDD O
for O
backups O
and O
movies O
, O
plus O
I O
got O
an O
external O
DVD O
writer O
. O

Once O
you O
have O
done O
this O
click O
on O
sounds O
. O

I O
probably O
have O
1 O
hr O
, O
1 O
. O
5 O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
, O
depending O
on O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
( O
not O
necessarily O
great O
for O
a O
laptop O
, O
but O
about O
what O
I O
had O
with O
the O
original O
battery O
) O
. O

Just O
be O
careful O
of O
the O
extreme O
rides O
that O
require O
you O
to O
use O
a O
locker O
for O
your O
stuff O
. O

They O
cost O
$ O
13 O
each O
and O
they O
're O
sturdier O
than O
most O
but O
very O
light O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
after O
buying O
my O
third O
battery O
( O
$ O
120 O
each O
) O
because O
I O
wanted O
try O
and O
prolong O
the O
life O
of O
my O
new O
battery O
. O

Purchased O
this O
in O
April O
2008 O
. O

Installation O
was O
not O
that O
difficult O
as O
long O
as O
you O
apply O
enough O
application O
fluid O
to O
allow O
the O
protector O
to O
slide O
around O
on O
the O
tablet O
screen O
when O
positioning O
it O
. O

I O
tried O
upgrading O
to O
lion O
but O
it O
did O
not O
help O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
upgrade O
my O
mac O
mini O
ram O
from O
4 O
gb O
to O
8 O
gb O
. O

It O
is O
much O
better O
than O
a O
PDA O
phone O
, O
since O
you O
get O
full O
web O
pages O
displayed O
, O
and O
much O
more O
portable O
than O
my O
laptop O
. O

Nokia O
decided O
to O
put O
the O
toggle O
pads O
on O
the O
left O
- O
side O
which O
is O
, O
frankly O
, O
inconvenient O
. O

One O
of O
the O
bigger O
problems O
is O
when O
the O
left O
button O
is O
clicked O
, O
it O
often O
double O
or O
triple O
clicks O
. O

After O
a O
few O
aftermarket O
failures O
I O
just O
maned O
up O
and O
bought O
the O
ASUS O
replacement O
. O

There O
is O
a O
slight O
delay O
in O
the O
video O
, O
the O
audio O
is O
adequate O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
that O
purpose O
only O
. O

All O
the O
cloning O
process O
took O
about O
2 O
. O
5 O
hours O
. O

This O
case O
is O
tiny O
, O
not O
much O
larger O
than O
the O
drive O
itself O
which O
, O
perfectly O
, O
fits O
like O
a O
glove O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
tablet O
, O
no O
wifi O
issues O
, O
the O
design O
is O
the O
best O
, O
with O
the O
dock O
looks O
really O
nice O
, O
i O
really O
love O
it O
, O
thanks O

Absolutely O

It O
will O
say O
it O

up O
or O
whatever O
when O
plugged O
in O
, O
and O
then O
nothing O
will O
happen O

If O
you O
know O
you O

then O

these O

I O
bought O
this O
bag O
to O
carry O
around O
my O
Asus O
Netbook O

Fits O
perfectly O
. O

and O
I O
can O
already O
tell O
a O
difference O
. O

I O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
remote O

When O
my O

I O
charged O
it O
with O
my O

I O
originally O

great O
purchase O

I O
put O
on O
a O
9dbi O
antenna O
and O
increased O
the O
distance O
to O
about O
1/3 O
mile O
but O
the O
throughput O
increased O
significantly O

I O
RECEIVED O
THIS O
CHARGER O
FOR O
ACER O
ASPIRE O
3680 O

I O
bought O
( O
then O
returned O
) O

Unfortunately O
, O
with O
keyboard O
, O
the O
case O
was O
too O
big O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
this O
before O
, O
so O
it O
is O
n't O
unique O
to O
the O
product O
. O

And O
even O
for O
me O
, O
despite O
being O
a O
IT O
Specialist O
for O
an O
excess O
of O
two O
decades O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
challenge O
doing O
remote O
operations O
, O
given O
my O
entire O
background O
is O
in O
IBM O
/ O
WINDOWs O
. O

Very O
well O
made O
and O
will O
not O
disappoint O
. O

The O
above O
was O
when O
I O
first O
got O
the O
battery O

Having O
the O
touchpad O
on O
the O
keyboard O
dock O
here O
gives O
a O
user O
full O
mouse O
control O
where O
desired O
and O
eliminates O
any O
concern O
about O
having O
to O
lug O
additional O
accessories O
around O
as O
I O
might O
( O
and O
do O
to O
some O
extent O
) O
when O
I O
'm O
carrying O
the O
DV8P O
around O
. O

Disconnecting O
the O
bottom O
two O
( O
towards O
the O
motherboard O
) O
antennae O
did O
not O
alter O
radio O
performance O
. O

But O
overall O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Since O
people O
here O
will O
testify O
to O
that O
, O
let O
me O
write O
more O
about O
a O
few O
of O
the O
things O
that O
have O
bothered O
me:1 O
) O

Same O
product O
, O
same O
seller O
, O
just O
through O
a O
different O
shopping O
site O
. O

sometimes O
really O
blows O
it O
out O
, O
like O
its O
a O
swamp O
boat O
on O
a O
race O
, O
even O
when O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
working O
a O
very O
light O
workload O
. O

If O
you O
get O
one O
that O
works O
, O
it O
's O
a O
fine O
tablet O

It O
's O
too O
roomy O
to O
be O
called O
a O
sleeve O
. O

However O
, O
nothing O
that O
could O
n't O
be O
repaired O
with O
a O
safety O
pin O
... O

Delivery O
time O
was O
good O
and O
excellent O
cust O

follow O
up O
. O

It O
's O
so O
inexpensive O
you O
ca O
n't O
really O
complain O
. O

I O
lost O
$ O
30 O
for O
nothing O
. O

If O
this O
is O
the O
best O
these O
idiots O
can O
do O
, O
I O
'll O
just O
remember O
to O
make O
sure O
everyone O
I O
know O
has O
better O
sense O
than O
to O
make O
the O
mistake O
we O
made O
, O
and O
steer O
them O
away O
from O
these O
NABI O
junk O
toys O
. O

and O
it O
worked O
perfectly O

Not O
the O

it O
was O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
the O
valet O
, O
it O
offered O
surge O
protection O
, O
and O
( O
BONUS O
! O
! O
) O

it O
works O
with O
any O
windows O
version O
as O
well O
with O
any O
program O
that O
uses O
video O
like O
FB O
, O
skype O
or O
yahoo O
messenger O
! O

However O
, O
some O
computers O
just O
might O
not O
work O
with O
the O
drive O
. O

so O
of O
course O
i O
looked O
up O
what O
they O
had O
for O
lap O
tops O
. O

As O
a O
complaint O
, O
the O
reddish O
tint O
near O
the O
trackpad O
has O
worn O
away O
but O
functions O
just O
the O
same O
. O

I O
wrote O
that O
because O
I O
almost O
clicked O
" O
PURCHASE O
" O
on O
the O
AmazonBasics O
bag O
a O
number O
of O
times O
. O

5 O

The O
only O
minor O
problem O
with O
my O
computer O
is O
that O
the O
touchpad O
is O
depressed O
a O
bit O
in O
the O
lower O
right O
corner O
, O
so O
when O
I O
right O
- O
click O
, O
I O
have O
to O
stop O
and O
do O
it O
very O
carefully O
. O

I O
have O
my O
two O
other O
original O
Toshiba O
charges O
for O
a O
long O
time O
- O
one O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
another O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
they O
both O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

and O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

I O
purchased O
it O
to O
create O
full O
backups O
of O
my O
iMac O
( O

) O
that O
I O
can O
store O
in O
my O
safe O
deposit O
box O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Red O
color O
is O
nice O
. O

I O
plugged O
it O
in O
, O
Windows O

found O
it O
, O
started O
it O
, O
ran O
it O
. O

perfectly O
( O
go O
figure O
, O
its O
an O
hp O
laptop O
) O
and O
i O
can O
fit O
all O
of O
my O
books O
too O
. O

They O
admit O
to O
not O
know O
the O
root O
cause O
. O

The O
original O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
turned O
me O
away O
from O
my O
PC O
and O
made O
my O
Toshiba O
Laptop O
basically O
collect O
dust O
. O

There O
is O
no O
shift O
on O
the O
right O
side O
. O

I O
dropped O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
it O
still O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

The O
Vanguard O
name O
and O
logo O
, O
along O
with O
the O
words O
" O
Since O
1986 O
" O
, O
are O
printed O
on O
the O
bag O
. O

The O
901 O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
machine O
just O
as O
it O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

If O
yu O
upgrade O
the O
RAM O
to O
the O
maximum O
16 O
GB O
, O
Intel O
Rapid O
Start O
will O
never O
work O
, O
because O
the O
cache O
is O
too O
small O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
fix O
according O
to O
HP O
tech O
support O
. O

SUPER O

high O
quality O
as O
well O
, O
and O
every O
game O
in O
the O
market O
. O

Usually O
if O
I O
have O
it O
full O
, O
I O
will O
just O
stow O
it O
in O
the O
overhead O
bins O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

Easy O
to O
setup O
using O
the O

. O

Get O
the O
missing O
part O
for O
your O
Laptop O
and O
make O
it O
complete O
. O

You O
're O
then O
left O
with O
a O
normal O
thumbdrive O
with O
no O
intrusive O
software O
trying O
to O
install O
itself O
everytime O

It O
's O
well O
constructed O
, O
looks O
good O
, O
but O
most O
importantly O
, O
it O
's O
pragmatically O
designed O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
huge O
deal O
since O
I O
would O
never O
use O
this O
exclusively O
anyway O
. O

We O
bought O
2 O
of O
this O
8 O
g O
memory O
modular O
for O
our O
two O
iMac-27 O
which O
are O
base O
on O
Intel O
i-7 O
3 O
. O

Ergonomic O
shoulder O
straps4 O
. O

She O
downloads O
her O
embroidery O
designs O
to O
a O
flash O
drive O
which O
we O
can O
view O
on O
our O
desktop O
PC O
. O

I O
am O
recommending O
this O
to O
everybody O
I O
know O
. O

I O
did O
previously O
use O
a O
2 O
dollar O
dongle O
, O
which O
worked O
ok O
some O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
would O
disconnect O
quite O
often O

I O
am O
MOST O
IMPRESSED O
by O
the O
Asus O

Not O
to O
mention O
my O
printer O
drive O
, O
some O
games O
and O
McAfee O
virus O
protection O
. O

It O
charges O
like O
it O
should O

I O
think O
if O
you O
had O
a O
smaller O
bottle O
it O
would O
work O
for O
you O
. O

This O
bag O
has O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
for O
portability O
or O
it O
has O
a O
handle O
where O
you O
can O
tote O
it O
in O
your O
hands O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
easy O
to O
setup O
. O

Netgear O
has O
n't O
updated O
the O
drives O
in O
a O
good O
while O
. O

Looks O
very O
stylish O
. O

Lately O
I O
've O
heard O
about O
PS3 O
systems O
going O
down O
( O
6 O
- O
27 O
- O
12 O
) O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
dvd O
- O
rw O
and O
the O
unit O
would O
not O
even O
try O
to O
work O
, O
however O
, O
Amazon O
was O
so O
kind O
to O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
Graveyard O

I O
Needed O
a O
few O
extra O
USB O
ports O
for O
my O
laptop O
and O
liked O
the O
design O
of O
this O
one O
so O
gave O
it O
a O
try O
and O
am O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
to O
use O
it O
very O
often O
. O

So O
basically O
, O
I O
have O
not O
found O
any O
thing O
that O
this O
product O
can O
not O
do O
! O

At O
work O
from O
your O
co O
- O
workers O
who O
should O
be O
working O
with O
you O
as O
a O
team O
? O

Looking O
forward O
to O
using O
it O
while O
traveling O
... O
in O
hotel O
rooms O
. O

Tip O
: O
try O
to O
elevate O
the O
speaker O
a O
bit O
( O
more O
than O
8cm/3 O
" O
) O
and O
keep O
distance O
from O
the O
wall O
for O
more O
optimized O
bass O
. O

It O
is O
a O
light O
device O
for O
getting O
to O
job O
done O
on O
the O
go O
. O

Under O
normal O
use O
, O
the O
fan O
runs O
less O
, O
so O
the O
battery O
lasts O
a O
little O
longer O
, O
and O
it O
's O
much O
easier O
to O
access O
the O
USB O
ports O
and O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
drive O
because O
of O
the O
added O
height O
. O

WMVHD O
files O
played O
great O
. O

The O
only O
configuration O
I O
had O
to O
perform O
with O
this O
mouse O
on O
Windows O
was O
slowing O
down O
the O
cursor O
speed O
through O
the O
control O
panel O
, O
but O
that O
's O
nothing O
. O

With O
a O
dual O
core O
Intel O
i7 O
, O
8 O
gb O
Ram O
, O
256 O
Gb O
SSD O
, O
the O
specs O
looks O
pretty O
damn O
good O
, O
until O
you O
get O
to O
the O
GPU O
, O
which O
is O
a O
fairly O
mediocre O
GT555 O
m O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
have O
2 O
of O
these O
laptops O
, O
so O
I O
can O
confirm O
its O
a O
design O
thing O
. O

I O
used O
it O
to O
connect O
a O
Western O
Digital O
HD O
to O
a O
DirecTV O
PVR O
. O

Received O
the O
TV O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
days O
the O
TV O
developed O
a O
loud O
intermittent O
buzz O
( O
probably O
from O
the O
power O
supply O
) O
. O

I O
WOULD O
RECOMEND O
IT O
TO O
ANY O
ONE O
. O

I O
will O
start O
this O
review O
by O
saying O
that O
my O
old O
laptop O
was O
beyond O
slow O
and O
well O
past O
its O
prime O
, O
so O
just O
about O
anything O
would O
have O
been O
a O
huge O
improvement O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
the O
batteries O
are O
weak O
, O
the O
sound O
is O
not O
very O
good O
. O

The O
center O
outlet O
is O
blocked O
if O
you O
have O
transformers O
plugged O
in O
there O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
mentioned O
during O
her O
class O
someone O
complimented O
on O
her O
laptop O
stating O
that O
it O
's O
so O
lightweight O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
many O
lightweight O
laptops O
with O
an O
i5 O
processor O
. O

With O
every O
generation O
laptops O
become O
more O
viable O
alternatives O
to O
desktops O
, O
giving O
you O
the O
ability O
to O
use O
them O
as O
a O
desktop O
by O
connecting O
them O
to O
an O
external O
display O
and O
keyboard O

This O
device O
pairs O
, O
connects O
, O
and O
disconnects O
solidly O
with O
anything O
I O
have O
thrown O
at O
it O
. O

Its O
a O
great O
computer O
and O
its O
excellent O
for O
everyday O
use O
but O
it O
lacks O
of O
an O
iluminated O
keyboard O
; O
the O
video O
quality O
of O
the O
camera O
is O
awful O
( O
same O
problem O
with O
every O
Toshiba O
and O
most O
pc O
laptops O
with O
a O
web O
camera O
) O
and O
the O
Intel O
video O
card O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
Nvidia O
or O
Ati O
. O

Pros O
: O
I O
only O
have O
to O
connect O
one O
cable O
to O
my O
laptopSetup O
was O
easyHDMI O
, O
DVI O
, O
Sound O
, O
Network O
, O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
and O
3 O
. O
0 O
connectors O
. O

Buyer O
beware O
- O
this O
cable O
works O
just O
fine O
, O
but O
I O
doubt O
you O
'll O
be O
impressed O
with O
it O
's O
performance O
. O

not O
crap O
.. O
just O
chineese O
qualitynot O
dung O
but O
doneok O
for O
da O
money O

And O
it O
's O
probably O
a O
very O
reasonable O
amount O
, O
considering O
the O
features O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
popular O
external O
amp O
with O
these O
phones O
, O
and O
after O
extensive O
testing O
( O
and O
single O
- O
blind O
testing O
with O
my O
wife O
to O
ensure O
I O
had O
n't O
suddenly O
gone O
deaf O
) O
concluded O
that O
they O
make O
no O
audible O
difference O
, O
on O
any O
genre O
of O
music O
I O
own O
from O
classical O
to O
hip O
hop O
to O
alternative O
, O
on O
any O
bitrates O
from O
160 O
to O
lossless O
. O

Worked O
just O
as O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
. O

You O
need O
a O
USB O
thumb O
drive O
and O
you O
can O
download O
the O
firmware O
to O
it O
from O
Samsung O
's O
site O
. O

An O
additional O
expandable O
band O
keeps O
the O
cover O
closed O
when O
not O
in O
use O
. O

Apple O
clearly O
has O
something O
special O
in O
their O
batteries O
so O
you O
have O
to O
take O
them O
to O
their O
store O
for O
replacement O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
to O
connect O
wirelessly O
and O
it O
was O
much O
slower O
. O

This O
way O
I O
do O
nt O
have O
to O
hear O
it O
and O
they O
can O
both O
play O
and O
listen O
at O
the O
same O
time O
without O
bothering O
me O
.. O

I O
may O
be O
wrong O
, O
but O
why O
ca O
n't O
they O
design O
an O
interface O
for O
the O
older O
operating O
system O
? O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
I O
could O
purchased O
an O
ac O
adaptor O
for O
less O
than O
20 O
dollars O
. O

The O
Surface O
2 O
keyboard O
will O
cost O
you O
$ O
130 O
extra O
, O
plus O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
desktop O
version O
of O
windows O
with O
the O
standard O
Surface O
2 O
which O
costs O
the O
same O
as O
the O
Asus O
Transformer O
Book O
T100 O
. O

Only O
have O
used O
this O
for O
charging O
, O
as O
I O
travel O
on O
the O
charter O
bus O
routes O

with O
- O
two O
screws O
hold O
it O
in O
place O
and O
the O
hard O
drive O
caddy O
slides O
in O
and O
out O
. O

This O
cooling O
pad O
works O
great O
, O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
nice O
and O
cool O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
even O
hear O
the O
fan O
. O

but O
I O
could O
've O
lived O
with O
it O
. O

Tested O
with O
a O
supply O
from O
another O
unit O
. O

On O
the O
new O
version O
, O
the O
USB O
ports O
are O
rated O
at O
double O
the O
older O
power O
capacity O
( O
10 O
watts O
or O
2 O
. O

This O
was O
really O
neat O

The O
battery O
arrived O
undamaged O
and O
I O
charged O
up O
, O
fit O
in O
my O
netbook O
and O
works O
perfectly O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
high O
- O
end O
laptop O
cooler O
then O
pay O
for O
one O
. O

I O
had O
to O
return O
it O
and O
get O
the O
newer O
BlacX O
Duet O
. O

And O
I O
love O
having O
the O
dedicated O
buttons O
on O
top O
for O
pairing O
, O
previous O
/ O
next O
track O
and O
play O
/ O
pause O
. O

For O
scanning O
I O
can O
not O
more O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
Fujitsu O
ScanSnap O
and O
Evernote O
software O
at O
Evernote O
. O

I O
continue O
to O
update O
and O
filter O
through O
the O
entire O
amazon O
laptop O
list O
! O

I O
bought O
the O
iluv O
stereo O
powered O
speaker O
and O
those O
speakers O
are O
the O
same O
size O
as O
these O
and O
it O
can O
get O
very O
loud O
and O
handle O
the O
bass O
nicely O
. O

and O
again O
you O
really O
ca O
n't O
beat O
any O
price O
or O
any O
item O
that O
comes O
from O
AMAZON O
! O
! O

In O
short O
, O
do O
n't O
plan O
on O
switching O
back O
and O
forth O
between O
devices O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
. O

It O
is O
incredibly O
weak O
and O
does O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
cool O
your O
laptop O
. O

For O
a O
total O
of O
~ O
$ O
1700 O
, O
I O
have O
a O
Haswell O
G750 O
laptop O
with O
premium O
graphics O
and O
32 O
GB O
RAM O
, O

While O
it O
is O
n't O
quite O
the O
fastest O
available O
, O
its O
reviews O
indicate O
that O
it O
is O
much O
more O
reliable O
than O
competition O
from O
other O
brands O
. O

There O
s O
a O
few O
small O
scratches O
, O
but O
after O
4 O
years O
I O
wold O
expect O
nothing O
less O
. O

So O
that O
's O
the O
price O
part O
. O

and O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
when O
I O
viewed O
the O
pictures O
on O
my O
computer O
and O
discovered O
the O
poor O
quality O
. O

As O
much O
as O
I O
love O
my O
Samsung O
, O
I O
do O
really O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
touchscreen O
, O
simply O
because O
the O
more O
I O
use O
a O
laptop O
with O
touchscreen O
, O
the O
more O
I O
find O
myself O
reaching O
out O
to O
use O
it O
on O
a O
non O
- O
touch O
device O
like O
my O
MacPro O
or O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
. O

It O
is O
light O
weight O
and O
easy O
to O
carry O
but O
still O
fairly O
sturdy O
. O

i O
guess O
it O
diverted O
all O
the O
power O
to O
itself O
or O
something O
... O
even O
though O
it O
would O
n't O
work O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
deal O

So O
far O
, O
it O
's O
working O
really O
well O
... O

The O
improvement O
in O
the O
use O
of O
this O
computer O
was O
10 O
fold O
. O

The O
Web O
Link O
is O
really O
really O
bad O
. O

-1 O
star O
for O
all O
the O
bloatware O
and O
trackpad O
though O
. O

but O
I O
love O
this O
product O
. O

It O
's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
very O
fast O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
fantastic O
. O

Obviously O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
as O
good O
as O
a O
kickin O
sound O
system O
, O
but O
for O
a O
mono O
speaker O
that O
fits O
in O
the O
palm O
of O
your O
hand O
, O
it O
's O
quite O
impressive O
. O

Using O
this O
enclosure O
with O
aSamsung O
830 O
Series O
128 O
GB O
SSDand O
connecting O
it O
to O
the O
USB3 O
. O
0 O
port O
on O
my O
Windows O
8 O
. O

It O
worked O
with O
my O
iPod O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
my O
phone O
, O
but O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
this O
a O
try O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
all O
it O
does O
is O
provide O
what O
amounts O
to O
LINKS O
which O
may O
or O
may O
not O
work O
, O
to O
websites O
around O
the O
internet O
. O

The O
connecting O
usb O
cable O
is O
short O
. O

Does O
stick O
out O
of O
the O
slot O
a O
bit O
though O
- O
not O
a O
bother O
for O
me O
and O
still O
fits O
fine O
in O
my O
laptop O
bag O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
the O
standard O
camera O
strap O
advertising O
the O
manufascturer O
's O
name O
. O

The O
downside O
of O
this O
case O
is O
what O
several O
others O
have O
noted O
: O
It O
is O
billed O
as O
being O
for O
15 O
. O

These O
stopped O
working O
after O
a O
few O
uses O
. O

The O
keyboard O
has O
a O
nice O
low O
volume O
tactile O
click O
to O
it O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
springy O
and O
responsive O
, O
it O
looks O
SO O
classy O
with O
the O
brushed O
silver O
exterior O
, O
photos O
look O
amazing O
on O
its O
screen O
, O
and O
it O
's O
still O
small O
and O
light O
enough O
to O
drop O
in O
a O
backpack O
. O

I O
will O
update O
, O
but O
right O
now O
, O
for O
the O
price O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
. O

beautifully O
crafted O
, O
aesthetically O
, O
from O
inside O
and O
out O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
camera O
for O
2 O
weeks O
now O
, O
and O
have O
successfully O
taken O
sports O
action O
, O
indoors O
and O
outdoors O
videos O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
a O
mistake O
to O
ever O
leave O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
this O
s O
- O
video O
to O
3RCA O
adapter O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
used O
for O
. O

I O
am O
able O
to O
use O
PS3 O
Component O
thruput O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
why O
I O
got O
this O
specific O
device O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
about O
running O
and O
playing O
games O
on O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
sure O
with O
the O
memory O
size O
and O
processor O
, O
it O
can O
probably O
play O
any O
game O
that O
was O
released O
before O
2000 O
, O
and O
might O
be O
able O
to O
run O
games O
that O
do O
n't O
support O
high O
definition O
and O
are O
last O
generation O
. O

While O
I O
believe O
the O
folks O
leaving O
the O
reviews O
about O
power O
drain O
and O
compatibility O
, O
I O
doubt O
the O
average O
person O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
such O
things O
. O

Speck O
products O
are O
known O
for O
their O
quality O
and O
they O
have O
struck O
gold O
with O
this O
case O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fairly O
intuitive O
television O
even O
with O
its O
numerous O
features O
. O

The O
Ubuntu O
version O
costs O
less O
. O

The O
case O
feels O
like O
its O
quality O
- O
the O
handle O
and O
shoulder O
strap O
feel O
durable O
and O
able O
to O
put O
up O
with O
some O
abuse O
. O

This O
connection O
is O
fine O
so O
far O
, O
except O
that O
it O
is O
really O
slow O
. O

this O
is O
something O
to O
look O
at O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
just O
so O
that O
I O
could O
have O
a O
super O
portable O
GNU O
/ O
Linux O
machine O
that O
I O
could O
take O
anywhere O
. O

The O
Mino O
is O
smaller O
, O
lighter O
, O
more O
convenient O
, O
has O
more O
accessible O
controls O
and O
software O
with O
more O
functions O
. O

If O
only O
I O
could O
get O
Logitech O
and O
Media O
Center O
to O
get O
along O
. O

Tamrac O
gear O
is O
not O
perfect O
, O
but O
their O
high O
quality O
, O
competitively O
priced O
products O
, O
often O
tops O
the O
competition O
. O

My O
curiosity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O

( O
did O
that O
with O
no O
problems O
) O
; O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
seems O
to O
support O
a O
lot O
of O
devices O
is O
great O
. O

So O
let O
's O
get O
to O
it O
. O

Easy O
installation O
, O
plug O
and O
play O
, O
and O
quick O
set O
up O
for O
this O
wireless O
adapter O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
it O
works O
great O
. O

There O
is O
room O
for O
carrying O
an O
appropriate O
computer O
and O
an O
e O
- O
reader O
or O
tablet O
. O

Sound O
- O
this O
little O
speaker O
is O
clear O
, O
and O
can O
reach O
a O
" O
good O
" O
volume O
; O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
better O
than O
the O
HP O
and O
MAC O
built O
- O
in O
speakers O
. O

The O
build O
is O
sturdy O
, O
the O
notebook O
computer O
is O
held O
in O
place O
while O
typing O
, O
and O
the O
cooling O
is O
wonderful O
. O

Would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
in O
any O
color O
. O

MUST O
HAVE O
WIDI O
HARD O
WARE O
AND O
SOFTWARE O
PREINSTALLED O
AND O
ACTIVATED O
. O

I O
've O
used O
the O
webcam O
with O
AIM O
chat O
, O
it O
works O
great O
and O
starts O
right O
up O
on O
it O
's O
own O
. O

Edit O
27 O
May O
2013:I've O
been O
using O
this O
cable O
for O
some O
time O
now O
and O
wanted O
to O
say O
I O
am O
as O
happy O
with O
it O
now O
as O
I O
was O
when O
I O
first O
received O
it O
. O

My O
monitor O
does O
not O
have O
any O
dead O
pixels O
. O

Would O
definitely O
recommend O
. O

It O
has O
buttons O
to O
turn O
bluetooth O
and O
wireless O
on O
/ O
off O
. O

but O
it O
is O
understandable O
they O
did O
n't O
include O
it O
since O
they O
want O
you O
to O
spend O
almost O
3 O
times O
as O
much O
on O
the O
speaker O
dock O
to O
get O
this O
functionality O
. O

I O
have O
two O
NuForce O
DACs O
that O
I O
use O
with O
the O
Chromebooks O
. O

They O
come O
with O
a O
nice O
array O
of O
sized O
ear O
fittings O
and O
the O
noise O
cancelling O
feature O
is O
excellent O
. O

It O
does O
not O
state O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
unit O
only O
works O
on O
120v O
current O
. O

The O
zipper O
is O
supposedly O
" O
waterproof O
" O
which O
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
open O
and O
close O
until O
you O
break O
it O
in O
. O

Intel O
n450 O
chip O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Toshiba O
NB305-N410WH O
and O
after O
nearly O
a O
week O
with O
it O

Often O
times O
, O
this O
memory O
card O
can O
be O
priced O
higher O
at O
any O
local O
retail O
stores O
, O
or O
online O
stores O
. O

Like O
having O
a O
flamengo O
.. O
or O
a O
electric O
ball O
. O

There O
's O
a O
little O
light O
that O
turned O
from O
orange O
to O
a O
bluish O
white O
showing O
the O
wireless O
was O
now O
running O
. O

Finer O
details O
, O
like O
stiching O
and O
symmetry O
, O
give O
the O
case O
away O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
generic O
" O
item O
- O
not O
very O
high O
quality O
and O
this O
makes O
this O
a O
$ O
50 O
item O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
$ O
100 O
" O
MSRP O
. O

This O
laptop O
does O
not O
have O
3 O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O

my O
laptop O
dimensions O
were O
definitely O
smaller O
than O
the O
case O
but O
i O
have O
to O
shove O
my O
laptop O
into O
the O
case O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
it O
repaired O
because O
it O
's O
worth O
keeping O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
others O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
one O
that O
comfotably O
holds O
my O
laptop O
at O
a O
good O
angle O
. O

I O
guessed O
at O
which O
button O
was O
the O
correct O
one O
to O
hit O

I O
used O
it O
to O
play O
two O
complete O
movies O
streaming O
from O
my O
iPad O
and O
it O
never O
faltered O
. O

Lenovo O
laptop O
G500 O
has O
excellent O
performance O
! O

Works O
great O
for O
when O
you O
have O
limited O
plugs O
! O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
want O
to O
risk O
spending O
over O
thirty O
dollars O
on O
a O
new O
battery O
only O
to O
find O
out O
it O
did O
not O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

and O
I O
carry O
everything O
I O
need O
to O
do O
the O
job O
in O
this O
bag O
.... O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
thought O
long O
and O
hard O
about O
which O
TV O
to O
get O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
one O
of O
my O
staff O
that O
wants O
to O
use O
two O
external O
monitors O
with O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
( O
2012 O
) O
. O

While O
I O
prefer O
fully O
modular O
, O
for O
most O
purposes O
it O
makes O
no O
difference O
since O
you O
need O
the O
hard O
- O
wired O
cables O
in O
the O
semi O
- O
modular O
anyway O
. O

Female O
4-Pin O
Male O
Adapter&#34;to O
use O
it O
with O
digital O
media O
devices O
. O

All O
of O
our O
computers O
, O
servers O
, O
network O
have O
been O
based O
on O
the O
Microsoft O
platform O
. O

I O
suggest O
that O
you O
buy O
an O
external O
2 O
. O
5 O
" O
hard O
drive O
enclosure O
, O
so O
you O
can O
use O
the O
built O
- O
in O
hard O
drive O
as O
an O
external O
or O
back O
- O
up O
hard O
drive O
. O

But O
other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
nice O
work O
of O
art O
. O

My O
laptop O
internal O
wireless O
stopped O
working O
. O

A O
few O
places O
that O
I O
can O
think O
of O
to O
use O
it O
: O

It O
does O
STAY O
in O
place O
... O
but O
is O
tenuous O
at O
best O
. O

Here O
are O
some O
helpful O
hints O
and O
what O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
to O
work O
and O
what O
you O
may O
not O
want O
to O
try O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

Just O
back O
up O
any O
files O
that O
are O
not O
in O
your O
" O
my O
documents O
" O
folder O
and O
your O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
if O
you O
need O
one O
- O
or O
a O
spare O
. O

It O
causes O
my O
mouse O
pointer O
to O
bounce O
around O
as O
if O
my O
finger O
is O
moving O
around O
rapidly O
. O

Everyone O
is O
impressed O
with O
the O
deep O
bass O
on O
this O
piggy O
. O

This O
refurbished O
unit O
comes O
with O
no O
manual O
. O

I O
think O
I O
am O
going O
to O
purchase O
another O
one O
for O
my O
living O
room O
computer O
. O

The O
battery O
last O
a O
good O
amount O
, O
and O
the O
range O
seems O
to O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
my O
two O
bedroom O
apartment O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
using O
JGM O
's O
rom O
3 O
. O
1 O
, O
even O
though O
there O
are O
newer O
variants O
, O
but O
this O
one O
seemed O
most O
stable O
, O
as O
many O
roms O
i O
used O
led O
to O
the O
tablet O
freezing O
and O
then O
not O
booting O
correctly O
, O
stuck O
in O
a O
freeze O
/ O
reboot O
loop O
. O

and O
it O
's O
not O
that O
much O
different O
than O
using O
the O
Kickstart O
program O
that O
comes O
with O
just O
about O
every O
version O
of O
Unix O
nowadays O
, O

It O
is O
so O
darn O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
good O
case O
for O
a O
2 O
. O

Was O
pretty O
cheap O
and O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
ends O
are O
too O
big O
to O
fit O
in O
either O
of O
my O
Creative O
Labs O
, O
or O
JVC O
headphones O
, O
so O
they O
're O
a O
FAIL O
for O
my O
purposes O
. O

but O
I O
like O
small O
devices O
so O
willing O
to O
put O
up O
with O
it O
. O

Works O
reasonably O
well O
with O
large O
drives O
and O
data O
transfer O
sizes O
under O
10 O
GB O
. O

It O
's O
incredibly O
light O
. O

the O
louder O
the O
more O
distorted O
the O
sound O
. O

A O
good O
product O
, O
and O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
when O
I O
saw O
it O
. O

We O
used O
this O
throughout O
Europe O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
for O
curling O
iron O
and O
flat O
iron O
. O

Cushioned O
, O
light O
and O
overall O
sense O
of O
quality O
. O

We O
use O
to O
have O
a O
main O
working O
station O
with O
solid O
components O
and O
heavy O
duty O
quality O
. O

Hopefully O
this O
review O
and/ O
or O
MobileTechReview O
on O
Youtube O
can O
help O
you O
narrow O
down O
your O
choices O
out O
there O
. O

The O
stand O
itself O
is O
light O
but O
solid O
with O
rubber O
gripping O
on O
the O
front O
and O
back O
ends O
so O
avoid O
scratching O
or O
sliding O
on O
surfaces O
. O

It O
also O
depends O
on O
where O
the O
fans O
are O
positioned O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

Upgrade O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
, O
though O
. O

That O
is O
well O
under O
Sata O
II O
's O
bandwidth O
. O

I O
restarted O
my O
computer O
and O
set O
the O
TV O
up O
as O
an O
external O
display O
and O
this O
worked O
much O
better O
. O

I O
got O
it O
because O
my O
old O
one O
well O
stopped O
but O
also O
because O
it O
would O
n't O
make O
a O
good O
connection O
with O
the O
laptop O

Also O
, O
the O
volume O
can O
be O
turned O
very O
loud O
with O
no O
distortion O
, O
so O
you O
could O
do O
a O
video O
presentation O
with O
this O
ultrabook O
and O
the O
client O
/ O
customer O
would O
not O
need O
to O
strain O
to O
hear O
as O
with O
other O
laptops O
I O
have O
used O
. O

Very O
well O
designed O
and O
put O
together O
. O

It O
takes O
about O
3 O
- O
5 O
seconds O
for O
the O
two O
units O
to O
pair O
, O
but O
once O
they O
are O
paired O
the O
video O
quality O
is O
as O
good O
as O
if O
I O
were O
wiring O
my O
set O
top O
box O
with O
actual O
HDMI O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
suggest O
this O
product O
. O

1 O
" O
, O
4 O
MG O
RAM O
laptop O
can O
do O
- O
only O
faster O
with O
XP O
. O

Never O
had O
any O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

The O
docking O
station O
works O
just O
great O
, O
takes O
up O
little O
space O
, O
holds O
any O
size O
SATA O
drive O
and O
connects O
to O
the O
Western O
Digital O
WD O
TV O
HD O
Media O
Player O
using O
a O
USB O
cable O
. O

Now O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
about O
certain O

Along O
with O

I O
've O

I O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
their O
great O
customer O

Battery O

8800MAH O

, O
only O
7200MAH O

Works O
great O
with O
my O

This O
replaced O
an O
aftermarket O
power O
adapter O
from O
a O
different O
manufacture O
that O
quit O
working O
. O

Lightweight O
, O
yet O
durable O
and O
enough O
to O

enough O
items O
for O
my O
day O

Volume O

Other O
than O
to O
initially O
check O
it O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
original O
- O
I O
carry O
it O

my O

I O
lose O
the O
one O
I O
have O
- O

This O
product O
, O
for O
its O
target O
use O
, O
is O
a O
great O
simple O
product O
. O

There O
's O
too O
much O
unnecessary O
stuff O
squeezed O
into O
this O
box O
. O

Especially O
as O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
get O
to O
a O
` O
desktop O
' O
view O
that O
mimics O
a O
Windows O
7 O
environment O
pretty O
closely O
. O

I O
put O
Office O
on O
the O
computer O
for O
usage O
at O
work O
and O
have O
no O
had O
a O
single O
problem O
either O
. O

It O
can O
play O
Hulu O
/ O
HD O
flash O
videos O
( O
unlike O
other O
weaker O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
a O
month O
after O
receiving O
this O
to O
get O
to O
put O
it O
to O
actual O
use O
, O
versus O
just O
looking O
at O
it O
and O
opening O
all O
the O
compartments O
. O

I O
'm O
listing O
this O
as O
the O
first O
con O
of O
an O
otherwise O
excellent O
device O
, O
because O
this O
defect O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
mine O
; O
many O
people O
on O
several O
forums O
have O
experienced O
the O
same O
thing O
with O
theirs O
. O

If O
you O
are O
running O
windows O
7 O
or O
higher O
, O
plug O
this O
baby O
in O
and O
that O
's O
it O
, O

kinda O
like O
a O
Toyota O
car O
leather O
seat O
. O

I O
fairly O
sure O
that O
all O
G73 O
's O
have O
the O
same O
dimensions O
so O
any O
of O
them O
should O
fit O
. O

oh O
well O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
minor O
complaint O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
unit O
. O

I O
bought O
mine O
from O
Micro O
Center O
and O
ran O
my O
standard O
test O
to O
write O
/ O
read O
6 O
. O

( O
I O
checked O
Amazon O
's O
reviews O
, O
but O
bought O
it O
from O
my O
local O
Staples O
for O
only O
$ O
49 O
. O

And O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
room O
for O
the O
mouse O
pad O
, O
wireless O
Logitech O
M325 O
or O
MS O
3000 O
mobile O
mouse O
, O
plus O
the O
Asus O
laptop O
AC O
adapter O
. O

Good O
price O
and O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
gel O
back O
covers O
for O
my O
iPad O
, O

Then O
there O
are O
the O
USB O
ports O
that O
seem O
to O
work O
when O
they O
feel O
good O
and O
ready O
to O
work O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
great O
regardless O
of O
whether O
you O
're O
just O
running O
around O
town O
doing O
some O
video O
or O
trying O
for O
something O
more O
" O
artistic O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
. O

Later O
that O
evening O
, O
all O
wireless O
devices O
experienced O
connection O
problems O
: O
no O
connection O
, O
no O
internet O
or O
abysmal O
link O
speeds O
. O

We O
're O
using O
them O
on O
a O
Vostro O
1000 O
and O
two O
Dell O
Studios O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
really O
nice O
and O
decent O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
connect O
to O
a O
static O
ip O
I O
have O
in O
my O
home O
office O
and O
it O
has O
resolved O
the O
problem O
. O

3 O
" O
notebook O
, O
just O
for O
quick O
jaunts O
, O
not O
anything O
serious O
, O
and O
good O
thing O
too O
because O
I O
have O
had O
to O
CRAM O
the O
notebook O
into O
the O
Sumdex O
bag O
for O
it O
to O
fit O
, O
and O

I O
tried O
one O
of O
those O
nokia O
tablets O
and O
returned O
it O
- O
the O
real O
qwerty O
keyboard O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
then O
tapping O
out O
words O
with O
a O
stylus O
on O
a O
screen O
. O

Best O
case O
3 O
+ O
hours O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
tossing O
them O
after O
a O
few O
months O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
a O
6 O
year O
old O
dell O
laptop O
. O

but O
it O
was O
not O
seated O
firmly O
until O
I O
installed O
this O
adapter O
. O

My O
iPad O
fits O
snugly O
and O
nicely O
inside O
and O
does O
n't O
slide O
around O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
five O
pack O
, O
and O
one O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

Really O
excellent O
if O
you O
're O
carrying O
many O
files O
safe O
and O
secure O
. O

The O
heat O
has O
to O
go O
somewhere O
and O
unless O
a O
laptop O
has O
a O
fan O
that O
blows O
like O
a O
jet O
engine O
( O
and O
likely O
sounds O
like O
one O
) O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
heat O

It O
is O
only O
a O
100 O
Gb O
drive O
and O
has O
been O
used O
off O
and O
on O
as O
long O
as O
I O
have O
had O
it O
. O

I O
then O
decided O
to O
slit O
the O
top O
leather O
attachment O
of O
the O
leather O
frame O
and O
slide O
it O
from O
the O
top O
so O
that O
the O
camera O
is O
at O
the O
top O
. O

Laser O
( O
old O
PC O
card O
was O
LED O
) O
-- O
works O
on O
most O
surfaces O
, O
even O
black O
. O

but O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O

And O
then O
three O
days O
... O
and O
then O
an O
hour O
. O

Very O
good O
battery O
life O
too O
. O

a O
month O
later O
, O
they O
had O
a O
technician O
come O
and O
take O
the O
television O
away O
. O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
tablet O
this O
one O
is O
at O
least O
one O
worth O
looking O
at O
, O
but O
if O
you O
know O
you O
want O
an O
Android O
the O
ATP O
is O
the O
one O
to O
buy O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
you O
leave O
time O
to O
charge O
it O
before O
you O
want O
to O
use O
it O
! O

And O
this O
is O
sometime O
no O
fault O
of O
the O
manufacturer O
. O

Just O
lay O
the O
phone O
down O
with O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
phone O
just O
above O
the O
& O
# O
34;Wireless O
Charger&#34 O
; O
logo O
and O
it O
starts O
charging O
immediately O
( O
if O
you O
flip O
the O
phone O
the O
opposite O
way O
it O
will O
not O
charge O
since O
the O
coils O
in O
the O
pad O
wo O
n't O
line O
up O
with O
the O
phone O
's O
coils O
) O
. O

I O
put O
this O
is O
a O
Dell O
Inspiron O
1514 O

We O
have O
five O
other O
computers O
in O
our O
house O
, O
four O
desktops O
and O
a O
laptop O
, O
and O
for O
this O
week O
, O
this O
has O
been O
the O
only O
computer O
I O
have O
used O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
'm O
declaring O
this O
behavior O
" O
by O
design O
, O
" O
sending O
it O
back O
, O
and O
moving O
on O
to O
another O
model O
. O

Do O
an O
internet O
search O
on O
" O
ReadyBoost O
" O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
that O
. O

Most O
importantly O
to O
me O
, O
the O
fabric O
is O
a O
very O
tough O
material O
that O
looks O
extremely O
unlikely O
to O
be O
cut O
or O
torn O
. O

It O
has O
this O
bumpy O
texture O
feeling O
to O
it O
, O
which O
I O
love O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
this O
strange O
, O
small O
mousepad O
too O
, O
if O
you O
have O
any O
use O
for O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
zip O
right O
up O
but O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
struggle O
to O
zip O
it O
up O
either O
. O

and O
I O
ride O
a O
noisy O
train O
. O

I O
do O
have O
to O
sometimes O
pull O
the O
zippers O
over O
the O
iPad O
, O
but O
once O
they O
are O
in O
place O
, O
it O
zips O
up O
without O
any O
issue O
at O
all O
. O

This O
is O
noticeable O
if O
you O
're O
eye O
is O
keen O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
're O
a O
graphic O
designer O
but O
most O
people O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
. O

MB O

sec O

The O
sound O
is O
also O
of O
better O
quality O
than O
the O
dinky O
ones O
given O
on O
the O
HP O
Netbook O
. O

I O
decided O
that O
its O
usefulness O
did O
not O
justify O
the O
price O
, O
and O
I O
am O
returning O
it O
. O

Well O
it O
does O
simply O
that O
repeat O
the O
signal O
coming O
from O
the O
alfa O
card O

Has O
performed O
just O
like O
the O
ad O
states O
. O

It O
plays O
loud O
enough O
outside O
that O
it O
can O
be O
heard O
at O
least O
100 O
' O
away O
. O

I O
did O
alot O
of O
research O
on O
these O
units O
before O
deciding O
on O
this O
one O
. O

It O
still O
looked O
wrong O
. O

Gaming O
and O
regular O
browsing O
was O
no O
issue O

Strike O
two O
. O

I O
feel O
a O
little O
extra O
space O
in O
there O
. O

The O
PC O
runs O
hotter O
than O
most O
as O
it O
is O
, O
although O
nothing O
too O
bad O
under O
normal O
use O
, O
however O
, O
when O
you O
try O
to O
play O
a O
game O
you O
get O
stutter O
for O
maybe O
30 O
seconds O
where O
the O
frame O
rate O
drops O
significantly O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
hardware O
works O
, O
I O
have O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
problems O
associated O
with O
this O
dock O
are O
either O
driver O
related O
, O
or O
a O
problem O
with O
Windows O
8 O
itself O
. O

There O
's O
a O
bar O
displayed O
to O
show O
the O
status O
. O

I O
eventually O
got O
myself O
a O
more O
feminine O
- O
looking O
Raspberry O
Incase O
shell O
which O
is O
just O
as O
good O
, O
but O
this O
Incipio O
is O
a O
bit O
more O
lighter O
to O
carry O
than O
mine O
. O

The O
TV O
was O
used O
at O
that O
location O
and O
never O
moved O
or O
bumped O
. O

Windows O
8 O
is O
much O
more O
intuitive O
with O
the O
touch O
screen O
. O

This O
will O
not O
necessarily O
replace O
a O
desktop O
computer O
. O

UNLESS O
THEY O
ARE O
THE O
SAME O
SIZE O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
leave O
the O
computer O
, O
but O
within O
6 O
weeks O
the O
headphone O
portion O
stopped O
working O
. O

, O
it O
also O
has O
built O
- O
in O
left O
/ O
right O
mouse O
buttons O
that O
also O
work O
well O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
good O
bag O
but O
with O
some O
improvements O
I O
mentioned O
above O
; O
it O
would O
be O
even O
better O
. O

Apps O
like O
Visual O
Studio O
or O
Photoshop O
open O
in O
3 O
seconds O
consistently O
. O

lacking O
dedicated O
buttons O
. O

The O
1 O
GB O
of O
flash O
memory O
holds O
60 O
minutes O
of O
video O
, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
. O

This O
is O
" O
The O
Little O
Tablet O
That O
Could O
" O
. O

Much O
cheaper O
than O
OEM O
and O
the O
brand O
is O
built O
very O
wellWould O
recommend O
ANKER O
batteries O

Completely O
unacceptable O
! O

When O
I O
attached O
the O
hard O
drive O
, O
the O
system O
immediately O
saw O
it O
and O
assigned O
a O
drive O
letter O
to O
it O
, O
just O
as O
if O
I O
connected O
it O
directly O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
it O
long O
enough O
to O
be O
certain O
about O
its O
durability O
but O
it O
seems O
very O
well O
made O
. O

While O
I O
would O
have O
loved O
to O
buy O
a O
13 O
" O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
netbook O
is O
4x O
cheaper O
& O
almost O
2 O
pounds O
lighter O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
is O
their O
adamant O
30 O
% O
cut O
and O
the O
closely O
controlled O
OS O
platform O
that O
keeps O
people O
away O
from O
writing O
s/ O

This O
is O
fine O
, O
just O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O

it O
's O
a O
bit O
better O
, O
but O
still O
lags O
and O
zooms O
by O
it O
self O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
experiment O
with O
this O
feature O
very O
much O
. O

YES O
WINDOWS O
8 O
is O
a O
poor O
upgrade O
and O
as O
I O
see O
outside O
of O
kids O
pretty O
much O
anyone O
coming O
from O
an O
earlier O
ver O
is O
struggling O
but O
DONT O
downgrade O
HP O
its O
an O
MS O
issue O
, O
so O
outside O
of O
this O
vs O
SAMSUNG O
you O
are O
getting O
a O
much O
faster O
computer O
, O
the O
touch O
pad O
on O
the O
HP O
is O
got O
ripples O
or O
indents O
vs O
Samsung O
smooth O
but O
guess O
what O
the O
HP O
is O
better O
, O
Samsung O
weighs O
4 O
. O
2 O
and O
HP O
at O
5 O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
fan O
I O
'd O
recommend O
to O
bigger O
laptops O
tho O
. O

but O
that O
's O
just O
quibbling O
about O
names O
. O

I O
noticed O
some O
people O
had O
problem O
with O
WiFi O
connection O
, O
I O
did O
not O
have O
problem O
thus O
far O
it O
might O
be O
a O
defect O
with O
some O
series O
, O
however O
I O
had O
disconnection O
of O
bluetooth O
which O
seemed O
resolved O
after O
Lion O
update O
. O

For O
my O
workflow O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
access O
the O
pop O
- O
up O
menu O
from O
the O
tablet O
buttons O
. O

Although O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
you O
can O
throw O
this O
product O
, O
drop O
it O
, O
and O
step O
on O
it O

But O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
something O
, O
I O
trust O
my O
data O
on O
these O
cards O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
does O
a O
credible O
job O
( O
unless O
some O
future O
update O
from O
Microsoft O
clobbers O
it O
) O
. O

Nothing O
like O
being O
told O
to O
tear O
apart O
your O
laptop O
and O
reseat O
eveything O
so O
they O
can O
avoid O
a O
warranty O
claim O
( O
and O
yes O
I O
have O
the O
call O
log O
saved O
for O
posterity O
) O

It O
also O
lights O
up O
really O
neat O
. O

It O
is O
not O
confortable O
at O
all O
to O
travel O
with O
it O
. O

The O
Konnet O

is O
a O
very O
good O
deal O
for O

This O
is O
a O
big O
step O
up O
from O
the O
last O
Macbook O
. O

Earlier O
we O
had O
bulky O
devices O
that O
use O
to O
last O
much O
longer O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
as O
a O

for O

you O

The O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
protect O
my O

I O
tried O
the O

( O
I O
chose O

this O
time O
around O
simply O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
wires O
coming O
out O
of O
my O
system O
. O

This O
was O
a O
gift O
and O
the O

I O
gave O

very O

To O
see O
if O
I O
could O
get O
along O
with O
a O
smaller O
machine O
I O
first O
tried O
traveling O
with O
a O
$ O
200 O
netbook O
, O
which O
I O
found O
to O
be O
simply O
too O
weak O
for O
my O
needs O
; O
however O
, O
I O
found O
the O
light O
weight O
and O
small O
size O
to O
be O
a O
major O
plus O
, O
so O
I O
went O
on O
the O
prowl O
for O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
form O
factor O
in O
a O
powerful O
machine O
, O
which O
led O
me O
eventually O
to O
the O
1380T. O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
yet O
found O
a O
fast O
way O
to O
turn O
the O
trackpad O
off O
when O
a O
mouse O
is O
connected O
. O

This O
tablet O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
, O
is O
the O
best O
investment O
that O
I O
put O
toward O
my O
laptop O
. O

Finally O
a O
computer O
that O
I O
can O
turn O
on O
and O
off O
on O
a O
whim O
. O

mine:- O

subsequent O
Microsoft O

. O

it O
is O
spectacular O
for O
everyday O
office O
use O
and O

Yet O
it O
's O
not O
unwieldy O
and O
can O
be O
comfortably O
carried O
either O
by O
the O
handle O
or O
the O
convenient O

. O

The O
actual O
Baofeng O
battery O
also O
has O
a O
small O
DC O
jack O
in O
the O

for O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
designed O
for O
a O

although O
I O
have O
not O

I O
hope O

does O
n't O
abandon O
this O

. O

A O
little O
bigger O
than O
it O
looks O
in O
the O

but O
still O
quite O
portable O
. O

Visitor O
: O
so O
what O
happens O
when O
the O
battery O
dies O
? O

It O
'll O
be O
packed O
in O
with O
my O
Chromebook O
from O
now O
on O

Due O
to O
unfortunate O
timing O
I O
had O
all O
of O
15 O
minutes O
to O
analyze O
what O
currently O
- O
shipping O
new O
machine O
provided O
the O
best O
bang O
for O
my O
budget O
of O
less O
than O
$ O
400 O
. O

Although O
I O
still O
lose O
my O
connection O
more O
than O
' O
normal O
' O
it O
only O
drops O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
and O
then O
picks O
up O
again O
, O
just O
like O
the O
laptop O
. O

May O
work O
well O
with O
other O
tablets O
. O

Particularly O
, O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
make O
your O
new O
MacBook O
a O
dual O
boot O
machine O
-- O
running O
both O
Mac O
OS O
and O
Windows O
-- O
you O
'll O
need O
a O
larger O

than O
the O

- O
installed O
in O
the O

Battery O
fits O
perfectly O

was O
a O

. O

Now O
that O
that O
's O
out O
of O
the O
way O
.... O
here O
's O
the O
positives O
. O

If O
your O

has O
a O
slot O
for O
this O
card O
and O
does O
not O
have O
an O
SD O
card O

. O

- O
you O
get O
the O
picture O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
formatted O
that O
drive O
OK O
. O

The O
cover O
's O
deep O
navy O
or O
plum O
background O
is O
first O
topped O
with O
thick O
mauve O
scribbles O
and O
then O
with O
thinner O

that O
says O

in O

vivid O
orangey O

red O

Worst O
company O
ever O
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
small O
bag O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
cell O
phone O
. O

The O
old O
Magnavox O
played O
the O
same O
movies O
with O
perfect O
color O
and O
crisp O
sharpness O
, O
by O
comparison O
. O

, O
then O
re O
- O
pairing O
to O
my O
wife O
's O
when O
she O
next O
wants O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Freaked O
me O
out O
at O
first O
because O
I O
thought O
the O
laptop O
might O
be O
fried O
but O

Long O
battery O
life O
, O
good O
sound O
, O
great O
feature O
set O
. O

I O
have O
had O
is O
on O
my O
bed O
, O
couch O
, O
thick O
down O
comforters O
, O
floor O
and O
table O
and O
it O
still O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
very O
cool O
. O

So O
while O
the O
plug O
is O
a O
standard O
DC O
plug O
, O
it O
is O
not O
the O
size O
typically O
used O
for O
HDD O
enclosures O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
great O
quality O
build O
. O

I O
got O
this O
to O
Extend O
my O
monitor O
onto O

this O
is O

such O
as O
the O

Then O
it O
goes O

where O
I O
have O
to O
push O

hold O
some O

Ca O
n't O
speak O
to O
how O
long O
it O

last O
, O
I O
've O
only O
had O
it O
a O

This O
one O
looked O
to O
be O
of O
the O
same O
quality O
and O
worked O
for O
several O

I O
bought O
this O

( O
I O
ordered O
the O
one O

. O

it O

grippy O

: O
I O
have O
purchased O
two O
of O
these O

This O
is O
a O
really O
nice O

for O
carrying O
a O

a O

. O

While O
Netflix O
does O
work O
on O
the O

, O
it O
's O
not O

officially O

shows O
that O
are O
formatted O
for O
4:3 O
are O
stretched O
to O
take O
up O
the O
full O

. O

This O
radio O
transmitter O
seems O
to O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
bad O
reviews O
, O
and O
everyone O
who O
has O
tried O
this O
FM O
transmitter O
surely O
has O
valid O
points O
. O

The O
one O
thing O
that O
I O
'm O
cautious O
of O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
gets O
very O
hot O
. O

Delivery O
was O

Plus O
, O
you O

it O

I O
bought O
this O

misplacing O

it O

It O
is O
not O
enough O

to O

When O
the O

I O
connected O
it O
to O
the O

charger O
, O
which O
is O
all O
magnetic O

and O
kept O
working O
while O
the O

charged O

had O
a O
great O
deal O

I O
have O
zero O

that O

I O

one O

This O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
coolest O
, O
most O
enjoyable O
upgrades O
for O
my O
workstation O
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

SOLUTION O
FOR O
SOME O
PROBLEMSThe O
manual O
was O
not O
very O
helpful O
for O
some O
of O
the O
problems O
I O
encountered O
, O
so O
I O
will O
share O
some O
of O
my O
solutions O
with O
you O
that O
worked O
for O
me O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
the O
product O
to O
buy O
is O
you O
work O
with O
sensitive O
information O
or O
if O
you O
're O
just O
paranoid O
like O
me O
. O

Right O
within O
their O
website O
they O
say O
" O
This O
power O
tip O
will O
POWER O
your O
notebook O
, O
however O
it O
will O
NOT O
CHARGE O
THE O
BATTERY O
. O
" O
. O

In O
these O
days O
of O
airports O
with O
almost O
no O
outlets O
& O
one O
delay O
after O
another O
. O

All O
apps O
that O
I O
use O
for O
word O
processing O
like O
QuickOffice O
( O
Word O
docs O
) O
and O
Google O
Drive O
again O
work O
flawlessly O
. O

The O
ultrabook O
wins O
hands O
down O
for O
desktop O
uses O
and O
Android O
( O
or O
ipad O
) O
wins O
as O
a O
tablet O
... O
but O
the O
500 O
T O
wins O
when O
you O
need O
( O
or O
want O
) O
both O
in O
one O
slim O
, O
portable O
device O
. O

I O
am O
a O
huge O
gateway O
fan O
! O

yeah O
, O
I O
had O
1 O
G O
RAM O
on O
the O
Vista O
laptop O
- O
pathetic O
) O
. O

From O
day O
one O
, O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
pushed O
in O
a O
way O
that O
my O
pinky O
finger O
does O
n't O
like O
. O

Honestly O
, O
what O
bothered O
me O
most O
was O
the O
setup O
. O

Too O
often O
it O
activates O
while O
I O
'm O
only O
trying O
to O
move O
my O
pointer O
on O
the O
touchpad.-No O
internal O
bluetooth O
. O

The O
Screenbeam O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
. O

" O
W O
" O
key O
just O
fell O
off O
for O
no O
reason O
whatsoever O
! O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
8 O
Gb O
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
could O
hold O
more O
pix O
than O
I O
would O
ordinarily O
take O
. O

I O
've O
already O
gotten O
two O
other O
people O
to O
purchase O
this O
BT O
receiver O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
if O
you O
leave O
the O
zipper O
even O
a O
little O
bit O
unzipped O
on O
the O
main O
compartment O
, O
the O
weight O
of O
your O
gear O
will O
cause O
the O
entire O
bag O
to O
unzip O
and O
dump O
your O
stuff O
out O
. O

The O
extension O
in O
quite O
flexible O
for O
and O
position O
you O
may O
desire O
. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
if O
your O
laptop O
does O
fit O
- O
this O
is O
a O
quality O
item O
made O
for O
durability O
and O
comfort O
. O

for O
the O
price O
, O
they O
work O
but O
do O
nt O
be O
fooled O
, O
they O
are O
not O
exact O
replacements O
! O

The O
straps O
were O
very O
neat O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
: O
I O
wish O
I O
bought O
2 O
or O
3 O
of O
these O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
confidence O
the O
zippers O
will O
last O
as O
long O
as O
the O
case O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
read O
/ O
deleted O
those O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
, O
there O
is O
n't O
a O
setting O
that O
would O
allow O
deletion O
of O
the O
e O
- O
mail O
on O
both O
the O
tablet O
AND O
the O
server O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
interface O
withthe O
tablet O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
this O
product O
is O
very O
good O
under O
this O
price O
range O
. O

The O
best O
extra O
feature O
is O
that O
the O
M185 O
has O
an O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
any O
trouble O
with O
that O
part O
of O
the O
mouse O
. O

I O
did O
buy O
a O
more O
slim O
version O
in O
another O
brand O
, O
however O
the O
fan O
speed O
makes O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

I O
will O
add O
to O
the O
5 O
star O
reviews O
with O
my O
input O
to O
say O
that O
this O
device O
and O
its O
software O
performed O
flawlessly O
. O

They O
always O
have O
a O
lower O
price O
on O
most O
anything O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
, O
the O
shipping O
is O
fast O
and O
no O
tax O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
. O

My O
Apple O
Powerbook O
G4 O
15 O
" O
came O
last O
week O
with O
an O
additional O
512 O
MB O
ram O
( O
1 O
GB O
memory O
total O
) O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O

Although O
what O
everyone O
said O
it O
did O
take O
me O
a O
few O
tries O
to O
close O
the O
lid O
on O
the O
thing O
. O

It O
certainly O
is O
n't O
windows7 O
friendly O
no O
matter O
how O
I O
try O
to O
install O
it O
. O

Addition O
after O
I O
have O
not O
remained O
loyal O
to O
Canon O
and O
bought O
Panasonic O
HCV700MK O
: O
This O
camera O
has O
no O
such O
a O
drawback O
- O
in O
the O
first O
moment O
you O
see O
the O
image O
, O
you O
can O
press O
the O
Record O
button O
. O

After O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
I O
decided O
on O
this O
one O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
new O
battery O
and O
it O
has O
been O
lasting O
for O
about O
four O
hours O

If O
someone O
were O
to O
stand O
behind O
you O
, O
they O
could O
get O
an O
idea O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
- O
though O
I O
'm O
working O
with O
images O

Eventually O
it O
will O
happen O
! O

I O
have O
nto O
tested O
it O
in O
bright O
sunlight O
or O
too O
much O
of O
a O
distance O
as O
of O
yet O
, O
but O
from O
aobut O
6 O
feet O
its O
working O
great O
so O
far O
! O

It O
is O
much O
lighter O
than O
it O
's O
predecessor O
. O

( O
Do O
you O
ALWAYS O
do O
action O
# O
1 O
before O
action O
# O
2 O
? O

And O
yes O
, O
it O
does O
NOT O
have O
a O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
drive O
inside O
( O
you O
may O
need O
to O
buy O
an O
external O
one O
) O

I O
'm O
reasonably O
tech O
savvy O

This O
cover O
has O
the O
letters O
written O
on O
them O
in O
the O
same O
exact O
spot O
. O

I O
have O
ABSOLUTELY O
no O
regrets O
. O

I O
like O
Linksys O
anyway O
. O

no O
& O
# O
34;generic&#34 O
; O
drivers O
used O
by O
the O
OS O
. O

Toshiba O
has O
a O
great O
product O
- O
fast O
, O
reliable O
and O
cost O
efficient O
. O

The O
touchpad O
works O
very O
well O
but O
is O
a O
little O
sensitive O
. O

Skip O
the O
Mionet O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
really O
into O
sharing O
this O
drive O
on O
the O

In O
light O
of O
Apple O
's O
announcement O
that O
the O
17-inch O
MBP O
is O
soon O
to O
disappear O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
worthwhile O
to O
update O
this O
review O
a O
bit O
. O

Keyboard O
etc O
. O
are O
comparable O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
first O
one O
purchased O
quit O
working O
after O
about O
a O
month O
. O

I O
was O
seriously O
doubting O
that O
this O
speaker O
would O
sound O
as O
good O
as O
the O
reviews O
state O
. O

Someone O
let O
me O
use O
their O
SONY O
and O
it O
had O
a O
tin O
sound O
, O
but O
the O
Audio O
Source O
gives O
a O
full O
sound O
, O
not O
tinny O
at O
all O
. O

Wanted O
to O
get O
this O
to O
sit O
on O
my O
desk O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
ITouch O
. O

Streaming O
is O
a O
Cloud O
feature O
, O
right O
? O

Love O
it O
... O
sometimes O
I O
am O
too O
lazy O
to O
get O
up O
and O
plug O
it O
in O
the O
docking O
station O
to O
charge O
. O

I O
found O
a O
video O
on O
You O
Tube O
showing O
how O
to O
easily O
and O
carefully O
make O
the O
replacement O
. O

. O

when O
I O
upgraded O
its O
memory O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
fix O
the O
issue O
. O

Unpacked O
it O
, O
and O
inserted O
it O
into O
my O
laptop O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
start O
writing O
some O
code O
on O
the O
go O
with O
this O
. O

I O
installed O
this O
in O
an O
older O
Dell O
XPS O
M1210 O
laptop O
, O
and O
populated O
it O
with O
32 O
GB O
and O
64 O
GB O
SanDisk O
Ultra O
micro O
SD O
cards O
. O

It O
works O
fine O
but O
user O
needs O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
expose O
it O
to O
extra O
- O
ordinary O
force O
. O

Ok O
, O
they O
are O
not O
your O
typical O
converters O
as O
you O
must O
use O
the O
appliance O
( O
hair O
dryer O
or O
high O
power O
device O
) O
at O
full O
strength O
or O
it O
will O
damage O
the O
converter O
or O
appliance O
. O

But O
it O
's O
big O
and O
heavy O
and O
makes O
my O
15 O
" O
laptop O
screen O
topple O
over O
. O

4 O

: O
Uninstall O
your O
Antivirus O
Software O
( O
important O
) O
then O
RESTART O
PCStep O
9 O
: O
Go O
to O
Windows O
Store O
and O
upgrade O
to O
8 O
. O

You O
can O
remedy O
this O
somewhat O
by O
adding O
some O
low O
- O
profile O
adhesive O
rubber O
feet O
( O
like O
you O
'd O
find O
at O
a O
craft O
store O
) O
... O

I O
give O
this O
1 O
star O
because O
it O
says O
G60 O
right O
in O
the O
title O

I O
am O
both O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance O
of O
this O
laptop O
as O
well O
as O
the O
sellers O
, O
Tampa O
Bay O
... O
they O
are O
indeed O
professional O
and O
had O
the O
computer O
here O
in O
no O
time O
it O
seemed O
and O
well O
packaged O
. O

so O
i O
get O
blue O
screens O
of O
death O
! O

One O
tip O
I O
think O
all O
need O
from O
reading O
the O
reviews O
is O
some O
of O
what O
I O
do O
with O
my O
tablets O
. O

The O
standard O
SSD O
allows O
for O
a O
huge O
jump O
in O
performance O
. O

This O
case O
fits O
my O
17 O
inch O
laptop O
perfectly O
. O

The O
chiclet O
style O
keyboard O
has O
full O
size O
keys O
with O
good O
tactile O
feedback O
and O
an O
intelligent O
layout O
. O

The O
touch O
screen O
works O
pretty O
good O
, O
and O
is O
sensitive O
enough O
with O
most O
Windows O
problems O
( O
but O
not O
all O
) O
. O

Honestly O
, O
for O
the O
money O
, O
this O
is O
great O
to O
just O
order O
and O
have O
lying O
in O
wait O
& O
# O
34;just O
in O
case.&#34 O
; O

I O
use O
it O
a O
lot O
to O
show O
pictures O
stored O
on O
the O
handy O
external O
SD O
, O
but O
the O
pictures O
need O
to O
be O
resized O
, O
or O
they O
are O
very O
slow O
to O
load O
. O

If O
you O
use O
your O
laptop O
here O
, O
there O
and O
everywhere O
, O
then O
this O
is O
a O
must O
- O
have O
product O
for O
you O
. O

The O
keys O
are O
a O
bit O
small O
but O
maybe O
because O
I O
have O
big O
hands O
. O

Hooks O
into O
my O
laptop O
, O
and O
into O
my O
smartphone O
headset O
( O

with O
In O
- O
Line O
Microphone O
S2INBI O
- O
SZ O
( O
Silver O
) O
) O
and O
it O
just O
works O
. O

If O
you O
're O
thinking O
of O
gettin O
a O
SSD O
for O
this O
or O
another O
Lenovo O
laptop O
, O
keep O
in O
mind O
it O
requires O
a O
7 O
mm O
height O
drive O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O

Backward O
compatible O
with O
USB O
2 O

0 O
and O
1 O

. O

and O
she O
liked O
it O
initially O
. O

Sorry O
if O
any O
of O
this O
is O
basic O
knowledge O
, O
but O
it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
do O
this O
. O

13 O
" O
model O
just O
fine O
. O

And O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
on O
this O
... O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
! O
! O
! O

( O
OTOH O
, O
you O
'll O
pay O
about O
3X O
the O
price O
of O
this O
one O
. O
) O

I O
read O
another O
helpful O
review O
that O
said O
that O
you O
simply O
get O
the O
device O
in O
an O
envelope O
. O

Amazon O
was O
fantastic O
about O
the O
return O
and O
upgrade O
! O
! O
! O

so O
had O
to O
buy O
an O
additional O
cable O
to O
change O
from O
USB O
to O
MicroUSB O
. O

This O
item O
was O
pruchased O
per O
request O
of O
someone O
in O
the O
department O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
before O
2 O
weeks O
of O
very O
mild O
use O
( O
and O
only O
used O
it O
to O
transport O
the O
laptop O
one O
time O
from O
NY O
to O
Boston O
and O
back O
) O
and O
one O
of O
the O
corners O
already O
got O
ripped O
. O

I O
even O
get O
to O
sleep O
. O

Took O
it O
to O
Europe O
, O
Canada O
, O
Mexico O
, O
for O
my O
netbook O
, O
It O
's O
in O

option O
for O

price O

and O
I O
love O
how O
it O
looks O

You O
'll O
find O
they O
do O
n't O
kink O
up O
and O
work O
well O
. O

This O
organizer O
is O
just O
fantastic O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
organize O
everything O
in O
my O
bag O
on O
a O
single O
organizer O
. O

You O
probably O
already O
have O
something O
laying O
around O
that O
fits O
the O
WD O
drive O
as O
well O
as O
this O
. O

If O
you O
're O
using O
this O
at O
home O
and O
the O
office O
, O
you O
'll O
need O
at O
least O
one O
Airport O
Extreme O
to O
get O
your O
WiFi O
going O
. O

It O
's O
made O
out O
of O
vinyl O

and O
only O
two O
handles O
and O
small O

on O

on O
the O

are O

I O
am O
using O
this O
to O
go O
from O
a O
cheap O
but O
awesome O
e O
- O
machines O
laptop O
( O
mono O
speaker O
! O
) O

AdapterThis O
product O
was O
far O
cheaper O
and O
physically O
smaller O
than O
the O
Belkin O
adapter O
. O

Watching O
videos O
is O
nice O
as O
long O
as O
you O
're O
the O
only O
one O
viewing O
and O
can O
angle O
the O
screen O
for O
the O
best O
viewing O
. O

I O
'm O
soccer O
fan O
( O
Argentinian O
) O
and O
i O
travel O
a O
lot O
. O

Price O
is O
right O
when O
on O
sale O
. O

including O
celerons O
and O
turions O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
big O
and O
beautiful O
and O
it O
seems O
fast O
. O

Almost O
every O
laptop O
these O
days O
come O
with O
bunch O
of O
pre O
installed O
unnecessarydemo O
and O
spam O
software O
so O
first O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
clean O
you O
new O
computer O
leaving O
noting O
elsebut O
microsoft O
and O
asus O
programs O
. O

I O
installed O
Ubuntu O
12 O
. O
04 O
and O
XBMC O
and O
the O
install O
went O
very O
quickly O
. O

Orbit O
- O
MP3 O
for O
iPod O

For O
that O
matter O
, O
if O
you O
've O
installed O
some O
HDDs O
in O
external O
enclosures O
and O
realize O
how O
enjoyable O
that O
can O
be O
, O
you O
will O
find O
this O
unit O
a O
real O
blessing O
. O

Altho O
the O
box O
says O
you O
can O
plug O
in O
other O
Kindle O
models O
for O
sound O
, O
from O
what O
I O
can O
tell O
, O
you O
'd O
need O
to O
buy O
some O
kind O
of O
adapter O
. O

i. O
e O
on O
the O
laptop O
and O
separate O
drive O
. O

So O
considering O
everything O
i O
hoped O
for O
around O
10 O
hours O
of O
use O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
product O
and O
it O
worked O
as O
expected O
. O

They O
could O
have O
just O
called O
it O
" O
Sony O
BluRay O
Player O
" O
but O
no O
, O
go O
figure!).All O

It O
is O
both O
a O
pen O
control O
device O
, O
which O
I O
prefer O
for O
working O
in O
software O
like O
Photoshop O
, O
AND O
it O
's O
a O
large O
touchpad O
, O
much O
like O
the O
trackpad O
in O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O
Extensively O
customizable O
, O
it O
operates O
on O
a O
similar O
principle O
with O
multi O
- O
touch O
gestures O
that O
are O
highly O
configurable O
. O

I O
use O
it O
to O
house O
an O
Asus O
G75VX O
( O
which O
is O
huge O
itself O
) O
, O
though O
it O
holds O
much O
more O
than O
just O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
figured O
, O
' O
hey O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
anyway O
' O
. O

Very O
sad O
fate O
for O
me O
of O
this O
needless O
spending O
, O
me O
, O
who O
was O
just O
trying O
to O
make O
both O
ends O
meet O
, O
as O
a O
working O
student O
, O
who O
works O
only O
20 O
hours O
in O
a O
week O
. O

Plan O
ahead O
and O
search O
around O
for O
a O
newer O
model O
. O

The O
two O
keys O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
it O
are O
actually O
part O
of O
the O
whole O
keypad O
surface O
. O

I O
just O
love O
the O
light O
pink O
color O
as O
well O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
really O
hated O
to O
send O
this O
guy O
back O
, O
but O
for O
almost O
$ O
1000 O
, O
I O
expected O
a O
machine O
that O
could O
zip O
through O
a O
Spongebob O
video O
without O
breaking O
a O
sweat O
. O

A O
spare O
lens O
or O
two O
would O
fit O
into O
the O
spaces O
left O
in O
the O
middle O
section O
and O
you O
could O
put O
other O
stuff O
( O
or O
your O
lunch O
) O
in O
the O
top O
section O
. O

We O
use O
it O
in O
the O
camera O
that O
we O
take O
out O
in O
the O
rain O
or O
cold O
( O
not O
a O
weather O
proof O
camera O
) O
. O

I O
will O
by O
from O
this O
seller O
again O
if O
needed O
in O
the O
future O
. O

gb O
Ram O
upgrade O

Two O
radios O
. O

My O
Apple O
EarPods O
sound O
much O
better O
when O
plugged O
into O
this O
unit O
than O
the O
ear O
buds O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
good O
and O
very O
strong O
. O

It O
seems O
though O
, O
that O
you O
need O
to O
set O
it O
up O
each O
time O
you O
want O
to O
use O
dual O
monitors O
, O
but O
I O
could O
be O
wrong O
. O

IMHO O
, O
PS3 O
is O
still O
the O
best O
bluray O
player O
out O
there O
( O
beware O
of O
bluetooth O
only O
remote O
for O
PS3 O
if O
you O
love O
your O
universal O
remote O
) O
+ O
gaming O
and O
DLNA O
which O
is O
missing O
from O
this O
TV O
, O
so O
you O
get O
it O
all O
. O

I O
have O
a O
router O
in O
another O
building O
and O
this O
in O
a O
computer O
in O
a O
separate O
building O
. O

Yeah O
, O
it O
holds O
a O
laptop O
, O
but O
it O
's O
ugly O
and O
the O
straps O
are O
extremely O
uncomfortable O
. O

For O
XP O
, O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
installed O
with O
drivers O
with O
included O
CD O
and O
for O
Windows O
7 O
just O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
it O
installed O
itself O
. O

8 O
lens O
attached O
, O
which O
many O
bags O
can O
not O
handle O
. O

If O
you O
need O
an O
OEM O
replacement O
, O
these O
are O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

modular&#34 O
; O
from O
my O
understanding O
of O
the O
definition O
. O

If O
you O
intend O
to O
watch O
a O
lot O
of O
fast O
paced O
sports O
or O
play O
video O
games O
I O
would O
recommend O
you O
pay O
out O
the O
additional O
few O
hundreds O
of O
dollars O
to O
get O
a O
higher O
Hertz O
rating O
. O

Burning O
CDs O
or O
DVDs O
is O
not O
very O
convenient O
when O
you O
want O
to O
backup O
a O
small O
number O
of O
photos O
every O
few O
weeks O
. O

So O
I O
go O
the O
the O
process O
a O
second O
time O
.. O
samething O
! O
! O

It O
it O
's O
not O
just O
move O
the O
jumper O
until O
you O
figure O
out O
the O
right O
setting O
for O
it O
. O

It O
worked O
fine O
surfing O
the O
net O
or O
light O
computing O
and O
would O
last O
for O
hours O
. O

but O
mostly O
it O
is O
very O
reliable O
. O

Needs O
a O
mini O
usb O
to O
usb O
adapter O
if O
you O
do O
not O
have O
a O
standard O
usb O
on O
your O
tablet O
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
" O
HP O
Protect O
Smart O
" O
- O
when O
your O
notebook O
is O
accidentally O
dropped O
, O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
protected O
because O
of O
the O
design O
inside O
. O

It O
is O
comfortable O
and O
the O
handle O
lets O
you O
slip O
it O
off O
of O
your O
shoulders O
and O
comfortably O
hold O
it O
, O
allowing O
you O
to O
slip O
into O
a O
crowded O
subway O
car O
or O
bus O

I O
purchased O
the O
32 O
bit O
Windows O
7 O
version O
for O
the O
old O
HP O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
even O
with O
the O
HP O
having O
a O
CPU O
with O
1/2 O
the O
speed O
. O

After O
much O
research O
and O
shopping O
, O
I O
picked O
up O
my O
HP O
G7 O
laptop O
at O
Staples O
for O
the O
unheard O
of O
price O
of O
$ O
399 O
after O
$ O
50 O
rebate O
( O
president O
's O
day O
sale O
) O
. O

What O
this O
netbook O
is O
, O
however O
, O
is O
a O
get O

I O
have O
one O
of O
these O
set O
up O
as O
a O
home O
theater O
projector O
in O
my O
bedroom O
. O

IS O
STRICKLY O
BROWSE O
THE O
INTERNET O
AT O
HOME O
. O

I O
think O
my O
ASUS O
is O
somewhat O
faster O
.. O
but O
this O
works O
just O
fine O
for O
any O
home O
wireless O
network O
.. O
unless O
you O
are O
a O
& O
# O
34;speed O
freak&#34 O
; O

I O
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
have O
it O
speak O
up O
. O

But O
i O
m O
pretty O
picky O
. O

My O
hard O
drive O
duplicating O
set O
is O
now O
complete O
and O
works O
very O
well O
for O
my O
purposes O
of O
making O
clone O
backups O
of O
my O
computer O
hard O
drives O
( O
both O
IDE O
legacy O
systems O
and O
SATA O
systems).I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
combination O
of O
this O
duplicator O
and O
the O
2 O
cables O
because O
the O
combination O
now O
allows O
me O
to O
backup O
clone O
my O
hard O
drives O
without O
having O
to O
remove O
them O
from O
the O
computer O
. O

Whatever O
happened O
, O
the O
issue O
seemed O
to O
have O
sorted O
itself O
out O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

Maybe O
if O
amazon O
would O
give O
me O
a O
handbook O
or O
conversion O
kit O
to O
help O
out O
us O
new O
users O
I O
would O
appreciate O
it O
more O
. O

This O
fit O
my O
Acer O
V3 O
- O
571 O
- O
9890 O
laptop O
perfectly O
. O

He O
is O
real O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
one O
freeze O
after O
another O
freeze O
for O
the O
time O
I O
had O
the O
unit O
. O

and O
it O
is O
so O
much O
cheaper O
than O
what O
you O
can O
buy O
at O
the O
store O
. O

Actually O
drops O
temps O
. O

Opened O
the O
case O
, O
popped O
the O
card O
in O
, O
plugged O
in O
power O
and O
the O
19 O
pin O
connector O
to O
front O
of O
case O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
find O
any O
cases O
that O
were O
an O
exact O
fit O
for O
my O
envy O
14 O
( O
most O
laptops O
are O
either O
smaller O
or O
larger O
than O
it O
) O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
just O
get O
the O
official O
HP O
case O
. O

, O
I O
remember O
, O
was O
much O
longer).I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
to O
address O
. O

I O
made O
work O
the O
following O
day O
and O
it O
worked O
for O
maybe O
5 O
min O
. O
and O
card O
light O
goes O
off O
again O
. O

Sped O
up O
my O
computer O
considerably O
, O
especially O
when O
multitasking O
. O

de O
la O
pc O

I O
purchased O
this O
same O
toner O
cartridge O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
for O
my O
Brother O
MFC-8890DW O
and O
it O
just O
now O
ran O
out O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
decent O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

To O
open O
the O
support O
leg O
you O
need O
to O
open O
clasp O
at O
the O
bottom O
first O
. O

If O
you O
primarily O
carry O
on O
your O
back O
, O
get O
a O
backpack O
. O

I O
also O
wo O
n't O
be O
adding O
MS O
Office O
products O
. O

This O
one O
works O
, O
but O
If O
I O
had O
it O
to O
do O
over O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
get O
a O
different O
case O
. O

Now O
I O
will O
say O
one O
drawback O
with O
this O
, O
as O
with O
any O
laptop O
sleeve O
, O
is O
that O
you O
can O
forget O
carrying O
anything O
inside O
other O
than O
your O
laptop O
, O
and O
maybe O
a O
flash O
drive O
or O
something O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
a O
hole O
has O
opened O
up O
at O
the O
point O
where O
the O
seam O
for O
the O
main O
handle O
connects O
to O
the O
seam O
for O
the O
zipper O
for O
the O
TSA O
compartment O
. O

Nice O
design O
, O
but O
the O
engineering O
seems O
offer O
. O

wifi O
range O
is O
not O
stellar O
, O
but O
good O
enough O
( O
I O
have O
a O
very O
weak O
wifi O
signal O
at O
my O
office O
, O
which O
one O
of O
my O
other O
laptops O
can O
barely O
connect O
to O
) O

this O
tablet O
is O
my O
daily O
workhorse O

It O
is O
great O
that O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
can O
take O
either O
of O
our O
ipods O
and O
plug O
them O
in O
to O
play O
music O
. O

I O
would O
call O
it O
a O
sleeve O
tailor O
made O
for O
a O
MacPro O
13 O
.. O

Since O
I O
have O
had O
this O
for O
awhile O
now O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
update O
my O
review O
of O
this O
product O
. O

One O
small O
minor O
thing O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
is O
the O
label O
sticking O
out O
from O
the O
case O
. O

Tablet O
arrived O
in O
original O
box O
. O

I O
live O
in O
tornado O
alley O
so O
this O
is O
important O
. O

It O
's O
expensive O
to O
produce O
this O
kind O
of O
light O
rigidity O
( O
no O
one O
else O
machines O
their O
laptops O
from O
aircraft O
grade O
aluminum O
) O
, O
but O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
indispensable O
for O
a O
workhorse O
portable O
. O

I O
have O
close O
to O
4 O
hours O
of O
life O
when O
on O
full O
charge O
. O

Arrived O
on O
time O
and O
brought O
to O
life O
my O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
. O

So O
basically O
you O
can O
put O
it O
on O
two O
computers O
- O
a O
desktop O
and O
laptop O
. O

This O
time O
I O
'm O
prepared O
. O

I O
also O
concur O
that O
the O
sound O
/ O
speaker O
was O
inadequate O
. O

This O
replacement O
worked O
perfectly O
, O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
as O
a O
bonus O
came O
in O
a O
matte O
finish O
instead O
of O
glossy O
... O

So O
the O
bottom O
line O
here O
is O
simple O
: O
if O
you O
will O
use O
the O
machine O
mostly O
with O
a O
monitor O
and O
use O
the O
built O
- O
in O
screen O
occasionally O
, O
get O
the O
11 O
" O
. O

The O
padding O
pretty O
much O
wore O
down O
4 O
years O
in O

This O
cable O
is O
no O
different O
. O

It O
will O
be O
a O
zip O
file O
, O
so O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
unzip O
it O
before O
installation O
. O

And O
looks O
really O
cool O
when O
living O
the O
drive O
inside O
connected O
to O
my O
laptop O
. O

Good O
Bang O
For O
The O
Buck O
too O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
portable O
rechargeable O
plus O
ac O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
that O
was O
waterproof O

simply O
plugging O
it O
in O
I O
found O
it O
did O
everything O
I O
needed O
a O
mouse O
to O
do O
without O
even O
installing O
the O
included O
software O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
when O
my O
factory O
power O
supply O
crapped O
out O
. O

I O
lowered O
my O
intended O
two O
star O
rating O
to O
one O
star O
after O
visiting O
the O
Belkin O
site O
and O
finding O
no O
help O
at O
all O
. O

Using O
the O
keyboard O
extends O
both O
the O
functionalityand O
battery O
life O
. O

so O
I O
have O
n't O
bothered O
digging O
. O

Does O
what O
it O
was O
intended O
to O
do O
very O
well O
, O
best O
set O
of O
laptop O
speakers O
on O
the O
market O
right O
now O
. O

it O
have O
given O
me O
no O
problems O
and O
works O
fine O
so O
far O
. O

Then O
I O
tried O
using O
the O
Logitech O
USB O
dongle O
which O
comes O
with O
the O
Z515 O
. O

The O
Chromebook O
is O
the O
most O
stable O
, O
reliable O
, O
secure O
computing O
environment O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

Imagine O
that O
, O
a O
wonderful O
little O
feature O
packed O
netbook O
for O
just O
$ O
28 O

I O
highly O
recommend O
these O
speakers O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
for O
something O
else O
, O
because O
of O
the O
design O
flaw O
and O
durability O
issues O
. O

so O
are O
it O
's O
cases O
like O
this O
. O

Really O
happy O
with O
it O
all O
the O
way O
around O
. O

I O
do O
, O
however O
, O
wish O
I O
'd O
gone O
for O
the O
one O
with O
the O
3 O
' O
cord O
rather O
than O
the O
1 O
' O
cord O
. O

People O
probably O
give O
this O
thing O
some O
bad O
ratings O
due O
to O
personal O
experience O
, O
& O
that O
's O
all O
you O
can O
go O
by O
. O

I O
have O
a O
USB O
hub O
, O
but O
the O
portable O
hubs O
do O
not O
come O
with O
AC O
power O
cords O
to O
power O
the O
ports O
so O
they O
are O
mostly O
useless O
. O

Smaller O
than O
OE O
came O
with O
keyboard O
. O

Blue O
light O
came O
back O
on O
and O
charged O
the O
battery O
up O
in O
no O
time O
. O

It O
never O
ceases O
to O
amaze O
me O
how O
some O
people O
rate O
a O
product O
down O
when O
the O
problem O
is O
actually O
with O
the O
hardware O
they O
are O
using O
it O
in O
or O
their O
own O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
on O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Excelent O
mouse O
, O
great O
control O
, O
perfect O
to O
do O
presentations!!The O
scroll O
is O
very O
sensitive O
... O

When O
that O
one O
fell O
and O
broke O
the O
screen O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
get O
myself O
another O
! O

Great O
protection O
with O
minimal O
weight O
/ O
bulk O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
for O
the O
price O
I O
guess O
you O
really O
ca O
n't O
complain O
much O
. O

it O
charges O
fast O
, O
and O
is O
a O
good O
charger O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
extremely O
pleased O
with O
the O
Logitech O
VX O
Nano O
cordless O
laser O
mouse O
. O

To O
get O
it O
to O
macro O
- O
focus O
, O
you O
have O
to O
move O
in O
slowly O
, O
and O
the O
object O
needs O
some O
detail O
, O
or O
it O
just O
loses O
it O
and O
goes O
back O
to O
infinity O
. O

From O
what O
I O
understand O
, O
they O
're O
a O
few O
times O
faster O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
video O
is O
pretty O
much O
perfect O
, O
although O
we O
only O
have O
a O
41&#34 O
; O
screen O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
it O
started O
getting O
noisy O
after O
30 O
times O
going O
off O
and O
on O
. O

It O
's O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
, O
something O
cheap O
, O
really O
good O
and O
nice O
for O
java O
programming O
. O

I O
have O
pretty O
big O
hands O
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
that O
hard O
to O
type O
... O

Hopefully O
it O
does O
nt O
break O
( O
knock O
on O
wood O
) O
. O

they O
are O
not O
cinema O
quality O
but O
they O
work O
great O
. O

It O
's O
exactly O
what O
was O
needed O
to O
work O
with O
my O
tablet O
and O
a O
keyboard O
/ O
leather O
case O
for O
the O
tablet O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
it O
boots O
fast O
, O
sleaky O
design O
, O
very O
thin O
, O
and O
good O
screen O
. O

It O
comes O
designed O
with O
non O
- O
slip O
pads O
to O
help O
keep O
the O
laptop O
in O
position O
above O
the O
fans O
located O
within O
the O
mat O
. O

I O
have O
a O
desktop O
and O
an O
iPad O
so O
this O
is O
just O
something O
to O
augment O
what O
I O
have O
and O
not O
my O
main O
computer O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
great O
for O
carrying O
my O
tablets O
and O
accessories O
. O

This O
one O
was O
cheap O
, O
reliable O
, O
and O
worked O
great O
. O

The O
power O
source O
did O
not O
stay O
connected O
, O
the O
battery O
dies O
quickly O
for O
no O
reason O
, O
and O
the O
customer O
service O
is O
extremely O
disappointing O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
fixing O
this O
. O

They O
pick O
up O
the O
radio O
stations O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
ability O
to O
play O
music O
off O
of O
a O
memory O
chip O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
. O

It O
's O
a O
power O
cord O
. O

Still O
a O
great O
little O
USB O
stick O
at O
a O
decent O
price O
, O
my O
wife O
prefers O
USB O
Sticks O
over O
SDXC O
micro O
cards O

So O
when O
you O
are O
used O
to O
watching O
channel O
4 O
, O
it O
appears O
as O
example O
, O
118 O
- O
1 O
on O
the O
TV O
. O

Either O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
or O
it O
does O
. O

The O
best O
, O
and O
I O
mean O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
for O
an O
actual O
HP O
brand O
charger O
. O

What O
most O
other O
reviewers O
of O
these O
speakers O
have O
failed O
to O
note O
is O
that O
, O
as O
for O
most O
speakers O
, O
placement O
is O
critical O
, O
to O
a O
greater O
or O
lesser O
extent O
. O

Bright O

Good O

its O
not O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
. O

no O
creo O

I O
have O
added O
the O
appropriate O
pictures O
. O

Its O
slimmer O
, O
lighter O
, O
does O
not O
need O
energy O
and O
cost O
about O
the O
same O
if O
not O
less O

however O
, O
i O
thought O
the O

warm O

the O
color O

is O
NO O

Overall O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
3 O

because O
it O
's O
a O
good O

, O

The O
installation O
was O
a O
bit O
tricky O
because O
I O
tend O
to O
just O
go O
straight O
to O
plugging O
it O
in O
rather O
than O
reading O
the O
instructions O
. O

Better O
/ O
cheaper O
than O
the O
gps O
that O
sell O
together O
with O
Microsoft O

. O

I O
just O
wish O
it O
were O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
Netgear O
WNDR-3700 O
, O
though O
not O
sure O
how O
stable O
that O
model O
is O
. O

plus O
they O
usually O
are O
limited O
in O
the O
number O
of O
USB O
connections O
you O
can O
have O
... O

and O
I O
still O
have O
3 O
hours O
left O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
why O
some O
with O
different O
designs O
cost O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
I O
got O
the O
least O
expensive O
one O
I O
could O
find O
on O
Amazon O
. O

Luckily O
the O
bag O
comes O
with O
a O
waterproof O
cover O
! O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
yet O
. O

My O
Dell O
15R O
has O
a O
15 O

6 O
inch O
screen O
and O
fits O
perfectly O
in O
the O

SpeakerThe O
speaker O
sound O
quality O
is O
actually O
better O
than O
I O
expected O
although O
It O
's O
not O
as O
loud O
or O
strong O
, O
but O
It O
's O
still O
great O
. O

It O
can O
take O
longer O
if O
you O
make O
your O
back O
- O
up O
disks O
immediately O
, O
but O
I O
delayed O
this O
until O
I O
had O
the O
computer O
completely O
set O
up O
. O

The O
MBA O
11 O
" O
weighs O
less O
and O
is O
consequently O
the O
better O
choice O
, O
but O
as O
amazingly O
light O
as O
it O
is O
, O
even O
lighter O
would O
be O
better O
. O

Nice O
price O
, O

with O
ease O
, O
very O
responsive O
( O
no O
lag O
like O
my O
wireless O
and O
Bluetooth O
mice O
) O
- O
plus O
no O
batteries O
to O
tangle O
with O
. O

I O
hate O
laptops O
that O
have O
them O
on O
the O
front O
edge O
. O

This O
hard O
plastic O
cover O
goes O
on O
easy O
and O
fits O
like O
a O
glove O
. O

so O
I O
left O
it O
, O
though O
I O
turned O
off O
the O
register O
reminder O
in O
msconfig O
. O

So O
I O
started O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
portable O
speaker O
system O
I O
could O
either O
insert O
the O
iPad O
into O
or O
would O
communicate O
with O
the O
unit O
wirelessly O
. O

I O
love O
this O
sleeve O
. O

Also O
the O
original O
does O
not O
charge O
the O
iphone O
, O
and O
since O
I O
recently O
got O
an O
iPhone O
, O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
time O
to O
upgrade O
. O

After O
just O
2 O
weeks O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
issues O
with O
this O
battery O
and O
my O
son O
has O
gone O
back O
to O
the O
original O
battery O
which O
did O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
except O
for O
capacity O
. O

I O
like O
the O
color O
and O
the O
ease O
of O
using O
but O
the O
holes O
for O
the O
different O
places O
to O
attach O
something O
to O
ipad O
and O
the O
camera O
do O
n't O
exactly O
line O
up O
. O

anyway.)Some O
people O
may O
like O
it O

I O
have O
this O
adapter O
plugged O
into O
the O
tape O
deck O
adapter O
and O
the O
cord O
from O
the O
tape O
adapter O
is O
neatly O
wound O
up O
around O
the O
miccus O
and O
tucked O
away O
in O
the O
ashtray O
. O

This O
computer O
also O
arrived O
without O
an O
invoice O
, O
which O
I O
was O
hoping O
to O
receive O
to O
claim O
22 O
USD O

6 O
case O
, O
got O
the O
16 O
when O
it O
arrived O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
MP3 O
player O
for O
the O
gym O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
its O
my O
imagination O
but O
the O
battery O
seems O
to O
charge O
up O
rather O
quickly O
. O

So O
anyways O
i O
go O
to O
start O
installing O
stuff O
on O
the O
notebook O
. O

For O
a O
while O
the O
tablet O
and O
dock O
worked O
really O
well O
. O

Since O
the O
TV O
and O
TV O
box O
are O
in O
a O
bedroom O
I O
appreciated O
the O
five O
foot O
cables O
on O
both O
devices O
. O

Back O
cover O
can O
be O
used O
with O
SD O
card O
in O
place O
to O
protect O
the O
card O
-- O
in O
effect O
becoming O
a O
slightly O
fat O
thumb O
drive O
-- O
or O
you O
can O
use O
it O
to O
store O
an O
extra O
SD O
card O
. O

This O
one O
is O
gold O
plated O
so O
that O
no O
longer O
happens O
and O
the O
sounds O
quality O
is O
great O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
powerhouse O
with O
only O
a O
Core O
i3 O
low O
- O
voltage O
processor O
, O
4 O
GB O
RAM O
and O
the O
standard O
integrated O
Intel O
HD4000 O
graphics O
card O
, O
but O
it O
never O
really O
seems O
to O
struggle O
doing O
everyday O
things O
like O
surfing O
, O
word O
processing O
, O
watching O
HD O
videos O
etc O
. O

I O
fall O
asleep O
, O
wake O
the O
next O
AM O
to O
find O
the O
laptop O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

Oh O
well O
. O

After O
doing O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
research O
, O
I O
found O
this O
product O
is O
manufactured O
by O
a O
single O
contractor O
however O
, O
it O
is O
distributed O
and O
sold O
through O
several O
different O
front O
companies O
. O

Like O
everyone O
else O
said O
, O
there O
is O
minimal O
padding O
( O
but O
there O
is O
padding O
) O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

and O
the O
built O
in O
battery O
is O
a O
bonus O

I O
have O
been O
tuning O
and O
adjusting O
my O
Music O
EQ O
to O
make O
them O
sound O
exactly O
as O
I O
want O
them O
and O
it O
works O
for O
me O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
at O
spending O
" O
about O
$ O
500 O
" O
on O
a O
laptop O
, O
you O
should O
definitely O
buy O
this O
one O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
unit O
( O
white O
is O
so O
much O
cheaper O
than O
black O
, O
unbelievable O
) O
after O
having O
bought O
and O
returned O
the O
Altec O
Lansing O

The O
cameras O
body O
needs O
a O
slightly O
better O
design O
and O
should O
be O
slightly O
smaller O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
other O
HD O
cameras O
since O
this O
does O
not O
do O
anything O
that O
those O
do O
not O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sturdy O
case O
for O
your O
netbook O
. O

I O
am O
in O
a O
dead O
zone O
within O
my O
apartment O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
superior O
processor O
of O
the O
750 O
comes O
in O
) O
. O

I O
greatly O
prefer O
the O
softer O
padding O
of O
the O
old O
Eagle O
Creek O
travel O
strap O
. O

I O
know O
some O
say O
the O
right O
shift O
key O
has O
been O
improved O
, O
but O
I O
still O
prefer O
a O
giant O
right O
shift O
key O
, O
not O
a O
small O
one O
. O

One O
major O
disappointment O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
1394 O
port O
, O
which O
I O
use O
for O
my O
video O
camera O
. O

I O
keep O
my O
laptop O
on O
most O
of O
the O
time O
so O
keeping O
it O
cool O
is O
important O
. O

Works O
as O
expected O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Although O
I O
have O
a O
Samsung O
LCD O
, O
the O
vertical O
and O
horizontal O
viewing O
angles O
are O
not O
nearly O
as O
good O
as O
on O
my O
2011 O
MBP O
17 O
" O
. O

I O
had O
to O
remove O
from O
my O
desktop O
that O
was O
ruined O
in O
a O
flood O
. O

This O
criterion O
was O
partially O
met O
. O

Bought O
this O
battery O
for O
my O
daughter O
's O
laptop O
. O

Upon O
opening O
the O
box O
it O
seemed O
simple O
enough O
.. O
even O
with O
only O
3 O
sentences O
of O
instruction O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
product O
as O
a O
way O
to O
make O
my O
laptop O
looks O
new O
and O
it O
did O
. O

Fast O
forward O
two O
months O
later O
and O
none O
of O
the O
places O
around O
us O
have O
Bluetooth O
speakers O
besides O
a O
very O
large O
chain O
store O
; O
the O
one O
they O
had O
was O
a O
Tango O
TRX O
; O
it O
was O
designed O
for O
use O
with O
an O
Apple O
Ipod O
, O
Ipad O
, O
Iphone O
but O
did O
come O
with O
BT O
connectivity O
. O

AUDIO O
QUALITYNow O
, O
this O
is O
where O
the O
speaker O
SHINES O
. O

Product O
arrived O
in O
carton O
and O
in O
clear O
plastic O
bag O
and O
without O
damage O
. O

Okay O
, O
now O
for O
more O
details O
... O

In O
any O
case O
, O
I O
think O
a O
cooling O
pad O
is O
an O
excellent O
investment O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
a O
laptop O
that O
does O
n't O
cool O
itself O
particularly O
well O
. O

We O
shall O
see O
. O

but O
if O
your O
default O
speakers O
are O
broken O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
shipping O
them O
out O
to O
get O
fixed O
and O
want O
a O
cheap O
replacement O
, O
look O
no O
further O
. O

However O
, O
I O
have O
a O
Lenovo O

The O

Still O
, O
for O
half O
the O
price O
of O
Apple O
's O
replacement O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

These O
are O
nice O
speakers O
for O
my O
teacher O
computer O
/ O

. O

Protect O

It O
is O
well O
made O
, O
reliable O
, O
and O
does O
a O
great O
job O
of O
cooling O
my O

; O
gaming O
laptop O
! O

( O
OK O
, O
here O
is O
where O
many O
disagree O
with O
me O
. O

Avoid O
like O
a O
plague O
! O

These O
are O
the O
easiest O
way O
to O
add O
additional O
monitors O
to O
laptops O
and/or O
desktops O
without O
expensive O
video O
cards O
for O
sure O
! O

Totally O
worth O
it O

! O
! O

I O
am O
only O
running O
google O

and O
surfing O
the O
web O
. O

no O
drops O
just O
maybe O
just O
bumped O
it O
around O
more O
than O
a O
person O
should O
. O

This O
has O
some O
nice O
new O
features O
, O
including O
the O
audio O
support O
through O
the O
mini O
displayport O
and O
longer O
battery O
life O
. O

This O
shipment O
came O
BEFORE O
it O
was O
even O
due O
... O

I O
have O
an O
ultrabook O
that O
does O
not O
have O
its O
own O
CD O
or O
DVD O
drive O
. O

The O
unit O
does O
come O
with O
a O
couple O
spare O
screws O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
. O

but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
how O
the O
outside O
feels O
. O

All O
I O
do O
is O
tuck O
it O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
case O
so O
it O
is O
n't O
in O
the O
way O
. O

my O
wife O
love O
it O
! O
! O

Because O
it O
has O
a O
large O
strip O
of O
velcro O
and O
no O
zipper O
, O
it O
could O
probably O
fit O
a O
larget O
tablet O
if O
need O
be O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
thick O
though O

and O
I O
've O
been O
happy O
with O
them O
in O
the O
past O

Professional O
probably O
wo O
n't O
be O

SInce O
I O
originally O
wrote O
this O
review O
I O
have O
only O
grown O
to O
love O
this O
computer O
more O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
imagine O
most O
users O
will O
find O
the O
16 O
GB O
sufficient O
. O

It O
paired O
easily O
and O
works O
flawlessly O
. O

It O
seems O
very O
well O
made O
and O
rugged O
, O
yet O
light O
and O
manageable O
. O

Very O
compact O
and O
roomy O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
Amazon O
uses O
a O
3rd O
party O
shipping O
company O
that O
is O
n't O
that O
great O

That O
can O
be O
a O
challenge O
when O
I O
'm O
traveling O
, O
although O
if O
I O
have O
a O
laptop O
it O
's O
possible O
to O
recharge O
the O
iPhone O
via O
the O
laptop O
's O
USB O
port O
-- O
as O
long O
as O
the O
laptop O
has O
enough O
power O
to O
spare O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
product O
fits O
perfectly O
on O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
every O
port O
and O
DVD O
drive O
are O
completely O
usable O
, O
the O
small O
stands O
in O
the O
back O
give O
it O
a O
nice O
angle O
to O
work O
, O
and O
you O
can O
leave O
them O
flat O
if O
you O
want O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
both O
batteries O
however O
, O
that O
's O
6 O
hours O
. O

From O
what O
little O
I O
've O
seen O
so O
far O
, O
recharge O
time O
is O
about O
4 O
hours O
, O
when O
the O
laptop O
is O
running O
. O

Very O
clean O
design O
, O
fantastic O
sound O
and O
crisp O
display O
. O

Reads O
DVDs O
like O
it O
should O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
means O
that O
optical O
and O
laser O
mice O
do O
n't O
work O
on O
it O
without O
a O
mousepad O
, O

thank O
you O
for O
your O
item O
was O
sent O
to O
me O
. O

However O
, O
when O
it O
came O
time O
to O
purchase O
a O
UPS O
for O
my O
home O
equipment O
, O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
ignore O
the O
price O
and O
availability O
of O
this O
APC O
unit O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
unique O
in O
having O
nice O
and O
usable O
pockets O
on O
the O
four O
sides O
. O

You O
can O
download O
a O
utility O
( O
Intel O
SSD O
Toolbox O
) O
that O
can O
be O
used O
to O
keep O
the O
drive O
in O
prime O
condition O
including O
TRIM O
. O

When O
I O
unplug O
laptop O
it O
just O
shuts O
off O
now O
. O

It O
's O
durable O
finish O
, O
great O
cooling O
- O
yes O
its O
warm O
to O
the O
touch O
, O
but O
by O
no O
means O
will O
you O
burn O
yourself O
as O
others O
have O
suggested O
in O
past O
reviews O
of O
their O
previous O
version O
of O
this O
powerbook O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
see O
the O
front O
door O
from O
my O
office O
window O
; O
I O
really O
need O
to O
see O
the O
postman O
when O
he O
comes O
to O
my O
front O
gate O
/ O
door O
or O
my O
Rottweiler O
will O
freak O
him O
out O
. O

So O
far O
, O
this O
one O
keeps O
on O
working O
. O

I O
tried O
one O
that O
was O
polarized O
and O
it O
stayed O
, O
but O
was O
still O
very O
loose O
and O
could O
easily O
slide O
out O
. O

I O
have O
looked O
so O
many O
options O
before O
I O
purchase O
my O
Toshiba O
Laptop O
M105-S3064 O
. O

so O
maybe O
I O
got O
lucky O
. O

The O
camera O
worked O
great O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Post O
Alaska O
Trip O
review O
: O

I O
'm O
hesitant O
to O
try O
another O
unit O
or O
model O
simply O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
money O
to O
waste O
on O
trying O
. O

every O
thirteen O
years O
really O
is O
n't O
all O
that O
bad O
, O
is O
it O
? O

Great O
deal O
for O
the O
price O
. O

The O
brushed O
magnesium O
finsh O
is O
really O
groovy O
! O

Touchscreen O
works O
great O
so O
far O
and O
processor O
is O
fast O
and O
quiet O
. O

Whatever O
you O
do O
, O
do O
n't O
buy O
this O
plastic O
piece O
of O
whatever O
, O
you O
'll O
regret O
it O
. O

If O
they O
had O
done O
a O
better O
trackpad O
I O
probably O
would O
've O
gone O
with O
the O
Surface O
Pro O
2 O
simply O
because O
I O
really O
loved O
the O
first O
version O
I O
had O
. O

Watching O
video O
's O
from O
hard O
drive O
is O
a O
different O
story O
, O
they O
play O
rather O
well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
suffer O
like O
those O
online O
videos O
. O

I O
've O
played O
full O
length O
movies O
from O
my O
notebook O
without O
a O
hitch O
( O
2 O
. O
5 O
hours+ O
at O
a O
time O
) O
and O
use O
it O
for O
photography O
/ O
custom O
video O
's O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
great O
product O
at O
a O
nominal O
price O
. O

Lo O
and O
behold O
I O
received O
a O
reply O
in O
less O
than O
ten O
minutes O
( O
on O
a O
Holiday O
night O
! O
! O
) O

I O
use O
this O
hub O
in O
ac O
- O
powered O
mode O
with O
my O
Raspberry O
Pi O
. O

It O
is O
also O
quite O
a O
lot O
bulkier O
than O
the O
original O
OEM O
power O
adapter O
. O

I O
chose O
this O
battery O
because O
it O
was O
the O
cheapest O
solution O
from O
a O
trusted O
source O
( O
Amazon O
) O
that O
I O
could O
find O
. O

Completely O
satisfied O
with O
the O
product O
and O
the O
faster O
response O
of O
my O
laptop O
. O

My O
brother O
bought O
this O
for O
his O
wife O
so O
she O
could O
enjoy O
touch O
screen O

I O
returned O
the O
set O
and O
the O
replacements O
arrived O
2 O
days O
later O
. O

and O
if O
so O
know O
how O
to O
fix O
it O
? O

I O
have O
70 O
games O
in O
my O
Steam O
Library O
. O

Check O
LENOVO O
'S O
site O
and O
Google O
it O
. O

but O
it O
was O
quick O
and O
painless O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
wanted O
it O
in O
a O
few O
days O
before O
our O
trip O
. O

I O
purchased O
two O
of O
these O
. O

I O
'll O
burn O
my O
laptop O
as O
fast O
as O
I O
please O
; O
thanks O
much O
. O

Build O
quality O
is O
just O
fine O
. O

After O
putting O
anything O
back O
together O
, O
the O
computer O
recognized O
& O
passed O
the O
additional O
memory O
, O
Windows O
booted O
up O
without O
problems O
, O
has O
lots O
of O
spare O
memory O
for O
the O
memory O
hungry O
programs O
, O
and O
everybody O
's O
happy O
. O

That O
leaves O
room O
for O
another O
telephoto O
lens O
( O
or O
2 O
zooms O
or O
primes O
) O
on O
the O
other O
side O
and O
a O
smaller O
prime O
under O
the O
camera O
. O

I O
received O
the O
item O
today O
and O
I O
think O
I O
chose O
very O
wisely O
. O

The O
knock O
off O
generated O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
radio O
frequency O
interference O
, O
so O
much O
that O
the O
laptop O
's O
touch O
pad O
and O
other O
keyboard O
controls O
were O
affected O
as O
well O
as O
nearby O
TV O
's O
. O

You O
may O
have O
to O
turn O
down O
both O
the O
computer O
's O
master O
volume O
setting O
as O
well O
as O
the O
apps O
volume O
( O
like O
in O
iTunes O
) O
to O
get O
a O
level O
low O
enough O
for O
a O
environment O
like O
an O
office O
cubicle O
or O
at O
home O
at O
night O
. O

AS O
GOOD O
ASTHE O
BATTERY O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
a O
new O
widescreen O
15 O
. O

Compared O
to O
the O
overpriced O
Monster O
cables O
, O
this O
is O
equally O
good O
if O
not O
better O
. O

The O
Sharx O
instructions O
give O
you O
complete O
details O
for O
setting O
up O
the O
camera O
through O
your O
phone O
's O
web O
browser O
, O
but O
I O
found O
it O
to O
be O
a O
huge O
pain O
to O
do O
. O

Overall O
, O
however O
, O
this O
netbook O
is O
very O
good O
. O

soda O
can O
and O
even O
that O
is O
a O
tight O
fit O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
always O
use O
the O
Safely O
Remove O
Hardware O
function O
, O
I O
just O
make O
sure O
the O
light O
is O
n't O
blinking O

remove O

Addition O
of O
two O
new O
colors O
- O
Red O
and O
White O
( O
ok O
, O
ok O
... O
this O
is O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
minor O
upgrade!).The O
T100 O
( O
S O
) O

I O
really O
like O
this O
keyboard O
. O

Usually O
one O
gets O
the O
more O
actuate O
feedback O
by O
reading O
the O
negatives O
. O

NEVER O
again O
with O
Asus O
, O
due O
to O
service O
. O

Some O
previous O
purchasers O
had O
negative O
reviews O
but O
the O
positive O
ones O
overwhelmed O
those O
few O
negatives O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
while O
the O
product O
documentation O
says O
the O
KVM O
switches O
automatically O
to O
the O
other O
computer O
when O
you O
switch O
one O
off O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
that O
happen O
for O
me O
. O

I O
do O
not O
work O
for O
Apple O
, O
but O

The O
outside O
zippered O
pocket O
hold O
my O
Kindle O
and O
has O
interior O
pockets O
making O
sundry O
items O
easily O
accessible O
. O

works O
great O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

Keeping O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
a O
single O
core O
low O
energy O
Intel O
processor O
. O

Ran O
CCleaner O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
was O
uninstalled O
, O
and O
then O
ran O
the O
same O
program O
in O
the O
registry O
to O
make O
sure O
nothing O
was O
left O
over O
. O

I O
took O
off O
2 O
stars O
for O
a O
couple O
reasons:1 O
) O

I O
can O
peel O
off O
the O
tape O
& O
use O
3 O
M O
automotive O
double O
stick O
tape O
. O

However O
, O
with O
any O
laptop O
there O
are O
always O
cons O
. O

No O
i O
did O
nt O
notice O
any O
bleeding O
on O
my O
ASUS O
and O
sound O
was O
good O
... O
was O
not O
expecting O
surround O
sound O

The O
predictable O
Bluetooth O
" O
lag O
" O
can O
be O
very O
annoying O
. O

For O
backing O
up O
my O
TV O
shows O
, O
I O
have O
1 O
. O
5 O
TB O
Western O
Digital O
external O

It O
cost O
less O
than O
ordering O

too O
, O
and O
has O
an O
18 O
month O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
wonderful O
, O
especially O
given O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
thing O
. O

First O
off O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
an O
artist O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
review O
this O
thing O
as O
someone O
who O
uses O
it O
on O
a O
semi O
- O
pro O
or O
pro O
level O
. O

They O
also O
kept O
a O
ethernet O
connection O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
for O
large O
file O
transfers O
on O
the O
network O
. O

You O
see O
, O
in O
a O
Goto O
Webinar O
, O
you O
must O
keep O
the O
Webinar O
status O
window O
open O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
do O
n't O
miss O
any O
questions O
being O
asked O
by O
your O
audience O
. O

Well O
, O
he O
must O
not O
have O
had O
it O
in O
the O
notebook O
pocket O
, O
which O
suspends O
the O
laptop O
well O
above O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

No O
better O
or O
worse O
than O
the O
battery O
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

the O
plastic O
could O
be O
better O
. O

but O
it O
does O
a O
fine O
job O

The O
instructions O
are O
not O
the O
best O
, O
but O
I O
did O
some O
research O
online O

other O
than O
that O
, O
its O
very O
silent O
, O
quick O
, O
and O
extremely O
easy O
and O
fun O
to O
use O
. O

At O
4 O
feet O
, O
the O
cord O
is O
a O
foot O
longer O
than O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
tab O
. O

I O
did O
nt O
realize O
when O
i O
ordered O
them O
that O
they O
were O
n't O
flat O
, O
the O
top O
is O
mounded O
( O
convex O
) O
and O
it O
makes O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
hit O
your O
home O
button O
, O
which O
i O
have O
grown O
so O
fond O
of O
that O
i O
hate O
using O
anyone O
elses O
without O
them O
! O

I O
waited O
till O
Aug O
for O
the O
dog O
days O
of O
summer O

I O
am O
a O
IT O
manager O
at O
a O
dealership O
in O
Houston O
... O

Not O
interested O
in O
gaming O
, O
heavy O
video O
use O
or O
reading O
e O
- O
books O
( O
I O
prefer O
ink O
on O
paper O
) O
, O
so O
a O
tablet O
makes O
no O
sense O
for O
me O
. O

It O
's O
so O
accurate O
that O
using O
anything O
else O
seems O
like O
a O
wast O
of O
time O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
have O
frames O
around O
the O
individual O
labels O
, O
so O
they O
're O
easy O
to O
peal O
off O
the O
sheet O
and O
there O
are O
no O
sticky O
wads O
of O
scraps O
littering O
the O
check O

in O
table O
. O

11/30/10After O
another O
night O
of O
the O
same O
remote O
issues O
... O

With O
the O
Anker O
battery O
I O
got O
over O
twice O
the O
run O
time O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
still O
not O
comfortable O
with O
the O
separate O
middle O
button O
: O

it O
will O
be O
the O
best O
money O
you O
ever O
spend O
on O
that O
laptop O
you O
have O
been O
wanting O
to O
replace O
. O

you O
can O
touch O
type O
very O
well O
, O
still O
slightly O
cramped O
but O
much O
better O
than O
the O

and O

. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
backpack O
for O
almost O
6 O
years O
now O
. O

It O
has O
never O
gotten O
hot O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
it O
took O
me O
so O
long O
to O
decide O
to O
get O
one O
. O

Purchased O

very O
good O

for O

PRO O
: O
Does O
the O
Job O
, O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
good O
laptop O
. O

Tools O
not O
required O
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
little O
bags O
that O
attach O
to O
the O
inside O
with O
Velcro O
. O

I O
love O
mine O
, O
and O
have O
recommended O
them O
to O
people O
who O
have O
loved O
them O
, O
and O
given O
them O
as O
gifts O
. O

In O
this O
aspect O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
not O
go O
with O
the O
first O
generation O
Type O
Cover O
. O

A O
weakness O
I O
observed O
is O
the O
zippers O
. O

Up O
and O
running O
in O
seconds O
. O

Note O
it O
is O
not O
a O
laptop O
for O
playing O
game O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tad O
long O
, O
but O
otherwise O
, O
it O
's O
not O
terribly O
loose O
. O

Otherwise O
an O
AMAZING O
laptop O
, O
great O
performance O
and O
stilish O
look O
. O

Seem O
well O
constructed O
. O

It O
gets O
warm O
as O
any O
charger O
should O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
folks O
complain O
that O
the O
size O
to O
too O
large O
for O
a O
tablet O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
wish O
for O
is O
if O
they O
carry O
all O
kinds O
of O
batteries O
that O
I O
need O
. O

I O
can O
not O
review O
as O
to O
how O
loud O
it O
is O
or O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
a O
charge O
since O
it O
would O
not O
pair O
up O
to O
any O
device O
of O
mine O
( O
Galaxy O
Nexus O
, O
Nexus O
7 O
, O
Apple O
Macbook O
Pro O
) O
. O

Sufficient O
space O
to O
keep O
my O
laptop O
( O
15 O
' O
) O
and O
carry O
my O
books O
to O
school O
. O

The O
camera O
itself O
is O
actually O
half O
- O
suspended O
in O
a O
neoprene O
sling O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
bag O
in O
a O
heavily O
padded O
compartment O
. O

After O
fully O
charging O
this O
speaker O
...... O
it O
sounds O
fabulous O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
word O
about O
ASUS O
: O
I O
like O
them O
. O

I O
got O
out O
mySPYDER3EXPRESSto O
calibrate O
it O
. O

My O
review O
also O
appears O
for O
the O
HP O
m9550f O
because O
Amazon O
. O

* O
cross O
fingers O
* O
not O
any O
time O
soon O
i O
hope O
! O

It O
works O
fine O
overall O
( O
I O
'd O
advise O
investing O
in O
an O
adapter O
) O
, O
but O
that O
was O
a O
real O
disappointment O
. O

Aspire O
One O
AOD255E-13639 O
10 O
. O

So O
I O
installed O
CoreAVC O
Professional O
, O
and O
disabled O
deblocking O
( O
which O
helped O
to O
offset O
some O
of O
the O
CPU O
load O
) O
. O

The O
speakers O
on O
my O
laptop O
make O
an O
irritating O
low O
volume O
but O
always O
audible O
screeching O
sound O
from O
boot O
up O
to O
close O
down O
. O

It O
is O
also O
quite O
solid O
I O
had O
no O
fear O
of O
damaging O
it O
holding O
it O
on O
it O
's O
edges O
. O

Short O
answer O
: O
do O
n't O
use O
for O
travel O
. O

but O
i O
'm O
cautiously O
optimistic O
on O
the O
sound O
reproduction O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
that O
after O
several O
more O
days O
of O
use O
I O
would O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
my O
hand O
/ O
muscles O
. O

The O
Nostromo O
did O
have O
slightly O
better O
button O
placement O
. O

then O
i O
have O
one O
for O
my O
laptop O
, O
this O
cover O
is O
designed O
for O
the O
laptops O
so O
there O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
over O
hang O

I O
will O
get O
more O
of O
these O
when O
they O
are O
needed O
! O

The O
black O
pebbled O
finish O
on O
the O
top O
is O
a O
welcome O
change O
from O
the O
fingerprint O
magnet O
finish O
on O
so O
many O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
a O
very O
generous O
3-year O
warranty O
, O
which O
is O
twice O
as O
long O
as O
the O
18-month O
warranty O
on O
this O
Anker O
enclosure O
. O

The O
32 O
mb O
SS O
cache O
combined O
with O
the O
500 O
mb O
hard O
drive O
is O
a O
nice O
combination O
for O
casual O
internet O
use O
. O

I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

No O
overheating O
, O
Stable O
voltage O
and O
current O
output O
and O
has O
a O
grounded O

: O

be O
quite O

It O
was O

% O
. O

However O
, O
after O
about O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
, O
I O
noticed O
it O
would O
only O
hold O
an O
80 O
% O
charge O
regardless O
of O
how O
long O
it O
was O
plugged O
in O
or O
how O
I O
used O
it O
. O

The O
neoprene O
rubber O
is O
nice O
to O
the O
touch O
and O
the O
frame O
is O
reasonably O
solid O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
it O
took O
all O
day O
to O
install O
, O
why O
you O
ask O
? O

We O
appreciate O
the O
quality O
and O

of O

I O
've O

would O
recommend O
it O
to O
someone O
who O

I O
ordered O
this O
case O

was O
surprised O
by O
how O
big O
it O
was O
. O

Still O
it O
is O
a O
very O
economical O
upgrade O
for O
your O
toothless O
devices O
with O
a O

port O
. O

but O
well O
it O
results O
that O
now O
my O

is O
the O
problem O

the O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
say O
that O
the O
macbook O
in O
my O
opinion O
looks O
better O
without O
the O
case O
so O
I O
probably O
wo O
n't O
have O
it O
on O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
problems O
with O
it O
bogging O
down O
when O
it O
gets O
warm O
or O
having O
it O
shutdown O

or O
anything O
like O
that O

I O
guess O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
, O
although O
this O
is O
n't O
the O
cheapest O
one O

Now O
, O
I O
... O

everything O
is O

, O
we O
bought O
a O
full O
size O
ASUS O
PC O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
replace O
an O
HP O
laptop O
which O
died O
right O
at O
two O
years O
life O
! O

Chose O
it O
over O
others O
because O
I O
liked O
the O
aluminum O
look O
and O
the O
rechargeable O
battery O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
the O
speed O
get O
ultra O
fast O

The O
first O
one O
I O
ordered O
did O
not O
fit O
my O
computer O
, O
even O
though O
it O
indicated O
it O
was O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

they O
make O
you O
pay O
the O
outgoing O
shipping O
cost O
too O
. O

I O
even O
have O
a O
cover O
on O
it O
to O
protect O
the O
outside O
of O
it O

They O
sound O
pretty O
good O
by O
themselves O
, O
but O
they O
are O
powered O
through O
the O
overbearing O
subwoofer O
so O
you O
can O
not O
run O
them O
alone O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
on O
a O
Windows O
7 O
64-bit O
machine O
. O

It O
's O
even O
lighter O
than O
my O
13&#34 O
; O
Macbook O
Air O
. O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
carry O
a O
charger O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
work O
, O
so O
it O
is O
gently O
used O
and O
it O
is O
plugged O
into O
a O
surge O
protector O
. O

1 O
) O
I O
prefer O
keys O
with O
a O
slight O
bit O
of O
concavity O
to O
them O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
based O
on O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
hoping O
to O
reduce O
my O
overall O
load O
. O

And O
even O
with O
this O
limitation O
it O
's O
far O
, O
far O
better O
than O
the O
built O
- O
in O
speaker O
. O

that O
part O
works O
fine O
. O

The O
camera O
I O
received O
is O
not O
the O
one O
that O
is O
pictured O
, O
however O
it O
does O
do O
a O
very O
good O
job O
as O
far O
as O
picture O
quality O
. O

Instead O
they O
said O
because O
the O
port O
had O
" O
physical O
damage O
" O
it O
was O
not O
covered O
but O
they O
would O
replace O
the O
motherboard O
which O
includes O
the O
USB O
ports O
for O
" O
only O
" O
$ O
325 O
! O

It O
makes O
everything O
look O
artificial O
, O
though O
when O
turned O
on O
for O
some O
games O
, O
they O
do O
look O
better O
. O

Insure O
you O
align O
the O
cover O
so O
those O
tabs O
are O
along O
the O
opening O
edge O
and O
not O
the O
hinged O
edge O
. O

These O
3 O
things O
were O
VERY O
IMPORTANT O
to O
me O
. O

I O
also O
liked O
the O
fact O
it O
comes O
with O
both O
digital O
and O
analog O
tuners O
, O
because O
our O
security O
system O
cameras O
broadcast O
on O
the O
old O
analog O
channel O
19 O
and O
when O
I O
want O
to O
check O
them O
I O
can O
simply O
switch O
to O
analog O
channel O
19 O
from O
the O
now O
standard O
digital O
channels O
. O

This O
left O
me O
unpleasantly O
surprised O
and O
frustrated O
, O
and O
just O
a O
few O
seconds O
away O
from O
emergency O
rebooting O
my O
computer O
, O
when O
the O
setup O
unexpectedly O
finished O
. O

Have O
it O
inside O
a O
messenger O
bag O
so O
most O
times O
I O
just O
keep O
the O
book O
case O
open O
and O
insert O
the O
MacBook O
inside O
with O
the O
top O
unzipped O
. O

This O
compartment O
allows O
this O
pack O
to O
be O
a O
really O
usable O
weekender O
, O
as O
it O
can O
hold O
spare O
clothes O
and O
personal O
accessories O
, O
while O
other O
compartments O
store O
the O
PC O
and O
tech O
gear O
. O

Allows O
me O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
drive O
on O
weekends O
without O
having O
to O
unplug O
it O
every O
time O
. O

Overall O
good O
value O
would O
buy O
again O
and O
I O
am O
looking O
for O
one O
with O
greater O
power O
storage O
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
the O
film O
peels O
off O
easily O
and O
, O
true O
to O
Zagg O
's O
feature O
list O
, O
leaves O
no O
residue O
on O
the O
screen O
, O
something O
to O
be O
thankful O
for O
as O
you O
bin O
the O
overpriced O
, O
discarded O
shield O
. O

So O
far O
I O
have O
n't O
found O
an O
RS232 O
device O
it O
wo O
n't O
interface O
to O
. O

If O
I O
had O
something O
that O
charged O
through O
a O
USB O
port O
, O
that O
function O
would O
be O
awesome O
for O
saving O
space O
in O
the O
surge O
protector O
. O

This O
bag O
only O
has O
a O
simple O
flap O
over O
a O
very O
nice O
pocket O
system O
on O
the O
camera O
side O
of O
the O
top O
flap O
. O

These O
are O
nice O
looking O
devices O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
simple O
to O
use O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
. O

I O
like O
the O
case O
so O
far O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
bag O
for O
my O
honeymoon O
trip O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Probably O
the O
best O
4-port O
USB O
hub O
on O
Amazon O
for O
the O
price O
. O

The O
tripod O
capability O
was O
an O
added O
bonus O
. O

and O
I O
feel O
like O
my O
tablet O
has O
more O
than O
ample O
protection O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
, O
anytime O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
monitor O
for O
three O
months O
, O
and O
I O
am O
much O
impressed O
. O

The O
pros O
are O
a O
great O
increase O
in O
battery O
time O
, O
useful O
special O
function O
keys O
( O
go O
back O
, O
volume O
, O
media O
, O
brightness O
etc O
) O
, O
and O
especially O
USB O
and O
flash O
card O
ports O
. O

I O
checked O
the O
connector O
on O
the O
tablet O
and O
found O
bent O
pin O
, O
around O
the O
center O
, O
sitting O
across O
the O
opening O
, O
closing O
it O
. O

- O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
it O
was O
the O
software O
. O

It O
was O
quickly O
replace O
as O
it O
was O
very O
noisy O
when O
going O
into O
its O
power O
saving O
mode O
. O

Double O
Darn O
. O

This O
is O
a O
huge O
oversight O
. O

Only O
down O
side O
is O
it O
has O
to O
be O
plugged O
into O
a O
car O
USB O
port O
all O
the O
time O
which O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
me O
since O
I O
keep O
one O
in O
the O
cigarette O
lighter O
spot O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
male O
end O
looks O
the O
same O
( O
sans O
the O
& O
# O
34;apple&#34 O
; O
port O
graphics O
printed O
on O
the O
ends O
) O
, O
but O
the O
female O
side O
on O
the O
cable O
i O
received O
is O
longer O
and O
skinnier O
than O
the O
shorter O
and O
fatter O
one O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

The O
rain O
protector O
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

but O
I O
was O
sent O
a O
link O
that O
supplied O
the O
needed O
drivers O
and O
the O
unit O
works O
fine O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
IS O
a O
sleeve O
and O
the O
whole O
idea O
is O
to O
not O
drag O
around O
an O
entire O
bag O
stuffed O
with O
every O
conceivable O
device O
you O
can O
think O
of O
. O

The O
best O
feature O
of O
the O
monitor O
is O
its O
size O
. O

Well O
my O
laptop O
does O
nt O
heat O
up O
as O
much O
anymore O
or O
shutdown O
. O

Ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
Logitech O
computer O
products O
, O
they O
always O
work O

Awesome O
shower O
music O
buddy O
! O

Note O
that O
if O
you O
are O
buying O
this O
, O
you O
may O
be O
bombarded O
by O
ads O
on O
some O
of O
the O
sites O
Rabbit O
leads O
you O
to O
. O

My O
cables O
are O
chunky O
and O
fit O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

The O
whole O
package O
is O
still O
half O
the O
size O
of O
the O
last O
bag O
I O
used O
to O
carry O
the O
ASUS O
. O

overall O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
bass O
produced O
from O
the O
speakers O
. O

Anyways O
I O
am O
most O
Pleased O
with O
the O
Computer O

I O
ca O
n't O
live O
without O
. O

A O
bought O
this O
to O
hold O
a O
11 O
. O

It O
is O
neoprene O
and O
stretchy O

battery O
lastes O
for O
9 O
hours O
if O
you O
turn O
off O
wi O
- O
fi O
, O
bluetooth O
, O
speakers O
, O
slow O
the O
processor O
, O
dim O
the O
screen O
, O
do O
nothing O
. O

With O
that O
said O
, O
the O
Tamrac O
Aero O
85 O
interested O
me O
since O
it O
has O
the O
feature O
of O
a O
sling O
style O
incorporated O
into O
a O
backpack O
. O

My O
old O
battery O
had O
worn O
out O
. O

Although O
I O
do O
notice O
now O
that O
the O
flap O
is O
becoming O
kind O
of O
flimsy O
, O
it O
still O
works O
great O
! O

You O
can O
also O
tuck O
them O
in O
the O
outer O
pockets O
if O
you O
want O
them O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

This O
is O
an O
excellent O
micro O
- O
USB O
cable O
so O
far O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
( O
I O
paid O
$ O
4 O
- O
the O
price O
seems O
to O
have O
gone O
up).- O

, O
I O
get O
good O
connection O
with O
this O
adapter O
( O
my O
desktop O
is O
upstairs O
and O
my O
router O
is O
downstairs O
) O
and O
i O
still O
get O
full O
bars O
. O

So O
, O
I O
guess O
it O
might O
be O
amusing O
for O
kindergarten O
crowd O
. O

We O
applied O
for O
rebate O
as O
specified O
but O
corsair O
would O
not O
honor O
their O
promises O
, O
will O
buy O
memory O
from O
someone O
else O
in O
future O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
really O
quite O
mediocre O
. O

and O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
trusty O
pack O
. O

The O
construction O
is O
solid O
. O

A O
$ O
10 O
pair O
of O
speakers O
that O
are O
powered O
through O
USB O
plugged O
into O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
TP O
- O
LINK O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
support O
many O
modems O
( O
only O
11 O
in O
the O
US O
) O
, O
and O
OpenWRT O
/ O
DD O
- O
WRT O
seemed O
inadequate O
. O

But O
I O
just O
leave O
it O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
tub O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
very O
sharp O
, O
boots O
fast O
and O
runs O
cool O
, O
It O
never O
gets O
hot O
even O
when O
sitting O
on O
your O
lap O
. O

However O
, O
other O
wireless O
routers O
we O
had O
used O
previously O
showed O
no O
signs O
of O
problems O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
say O
users O
should O
pay O
attention O
to O
interference O
from O
other O
equipment O
if O
used O
nearby.----------------PREVIOUS O
REVIEW O

Still O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
attractive O
and O
sturdy O
unit O
. O

So O
I O
sent O
it O
off O
for O
repair O
along O
with O
a O
note O
detailing O
the O
problems O
it O
was O
having O
and O
that O
re O
- O
imaging O
the O
HD O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
fix O
the O
problem O
. O

Extra O
inch O
of O
screen O
width O
makes O
surfing O
easier O
. O

Something O
sounded O
loose O
inside O
the O
adapter O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
so O
I O
just O
discarded O
it O
. O

I O
had O
it O
plugged O
in O
overnight O
but O
could O
n't O
even O
get O
the O
power O
light O
to O
come O
on O
. O

Shipped O
fast O
, O
but O
the O
delay O
this O
caused O
to O
getting O
a O
working O
system O
was O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

so O
it O
's O
not O
all O
cheap O
plastic O
. O

Pad O
Transformer O
TF101 O
Case O
Sleeve O
Folio O
Leather O
Cover O
with O
Stand&#34 O
; O
and O
it O
was O
a O
good O
fit O
but O
not O
exact O
there O
was O
a O
little O
play O
in O
it O
, O
but O
it O
's O
better O
that O
dropping O
it O
without O
a O
case O
. O

( O
1 O
) O
the O
battery O
cover O
is O
thinner O
, O
I O
'm O
afraid O
of O
breaking O
it O
.. O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
the O
scroll O
wheel O
feels O
cheaper O
/ O
lighter O
/ O
less O
precise O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
jewel O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
an O
inexpensive O
way O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
your O
7-inch O
tablet O
. O

so O
I O
was O
expecting O
some O
decent O
stuff O
, O
but O
when O
the O
USB O
Mini O
- O
Cable O
Kit O
arrived O
, O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
what O
I O
received O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
light O
, O
cheap O
, O
yet O
well O
designed O
laptop O
case O
. O

3 O
inch O
laptop O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
. O

There O
are O
3 O
buttons O
on O
the O
device O
, O
power O
on O
/ O
off O
, O
volume O
up(+ O
) O
and O
volume O
down(- O
) O
. O

The O
brightly O
- O
colored O
menus O
in O
the O
PS3 O
Amazon O
VOD O
app O
are O
even O
worse O
. O

It O
plugs O
in O
and O
the O
fan O
runs O
, O
but O
the O
laptop O
still O
heats O
up O
. O

I O
needed O
this O
because O
two O
of O
the O
four O
USB O
slots O
on O
my O
laptop O
are O
shot O
. O

I O
should O
add O
that O
as O
I O
have O
worked O
in O
the O
technical O
side O
of O
television O
broadcasting O
most O
of O
my O
adult O
life O
, O
I O
am O
very O
critical O
of O
image O
and O
sound O
quality O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kinda O
laptop O
you O
want O
to O
use O
the O
original O
keyboard O
because O
it O
is O
just O
so O
good O
-- O
rather O
that O
dock O
, O
slap O
the O
lid O
, O
and O
move O
on O
. O

Good O
sound O
. O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
them O
. O

These O
are O
okay O
... O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
protected O
very O
well O
and O
there O
are O
many O
pockets O
available O
. O

I O
'm O
running O
Windows O
Professional O
, O
Open O
Office O
, O
use O
IE7 O
, O
Trillian O
for O
IM O
, O
xfire O
for O
gaming O
IM O
. O

First O
, O
you O
enable O
the O
speaker O
. O

And O
this O
netbook O
only O
confirms O
that O
feeling O
. O

Bought O
another O
one O
to O
keep O
upstairs O
in O
my O
house O
since O
I O
kept O
having O
to O
run O
down O
to O
get O
it O
. O

So O
, O
for O
the O
money O
these O
are O
a O
decent O
set O
of O
speakers O
that O
look O
cool O
, O
sound O
good O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
exactly O
work O
as O
advertised O
. O

So O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
take O
my O
laptop O
where O
there O
is O
no O
electricy O
supply O
... O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
with O
a O
Apple O
Mac O
Mini O
MC815LL O
/ O
A O
and O
generic O
HDMI O
cable O
. O

If O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
decide O
between O
the O
" O
Core O
i5 O
" O
and O
" O
Core O
i3 O
" O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
Core O
i5 O
to O
gamers O
and O
people O
who O
run O
high O
end O
applications O
( O
like O
CAD O
software O
) O
and O
the O
Core O
i3 O
for O
people O
running O
business O
applications O
( O
like O
MS O

) O
and O

( O
Free O
upgrade O
to O
Lion O
was O
a O
nice O

computers O
clean O
i O
totally O
recommend O
this O
to O
them O
or O
if O
they O
like O
to O
design O
there O
computer O
and O
make O
it O
all O
pink O
and O
girly O
then O
i O
recommend O
this O
to O
them O
also O
! O

I O
instead O
set O
the O
sleep O
timer O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
unit O
every O
night O
. O

, O
I O
bought O
another O
one O
for O
Sunday O
school O
teacher O
. O

While O
this O
still O
does O
n't O
quite O
match O
what O
Apple O
promises O
, O
it O
's O
the O
highest O
I O
've O
ever O
, O
realistically O
, O
gotten O
out O
of O
an O
Apple O
laptop O
. O

The O
operating O
system O
is O
the O
main O
reason O
I O
switched O
from O
Windows O
to O
Apple O
. O

maybe O
I O
bought O
it O
my O
mistake O
... O

But O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
calling O
Asus O
for O
tech O
support O
. O

I O
like O
the O
desktop O
and O
feel O
of O
this O
machine O
and O
if O
they O
put O
out O
an O
update O
that O
would O
fix O
this O
stuff O
I O
'd O
reinstall O
it O
in O
a O
second O
. O

Given O
that O
there O
's O
no O
real O
3rd O
party O
adapters O
on O
the O
market O
, O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
what O
you O
want O
if O
you O
need O
a O
new O
power O
adapter O
for O
your O
Air O
... O

It O
is O
for O
my O
wife O
to O
use O
on O
the O
go O

This O
is O
NOT O
a O
normal O
thing O
for O
the O
Qosmio O
's O

Had O
to O
order O
a O
different O
brand O
item O
( O
with O
next O
day O
air O
) O
at O
a O
higher O
price O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
run O
Windows O
8 O
Metro O
or O
any O
other O
Microsoft O
software O
, O
but O
maybe O
that O
's O
a O
GOOD O
thing O
. O

When O
I O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
wife O

Okay O
, O
my O
opinion O
is O
that O
this O
is O
where O
Archos O
products O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
to O
. O

It O
was O
used O
but O
in O
Like O
New O
condition O
and O
works O
just O
fine O
! O

Last O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
fan O
intake O
coming O
through O
the O
bottom O
from O
my O
dusty O
, O
linty O
shirt O
, O
blanket O
, O
couch O
, O
floor O
into O
my O
new O
laptop O
. O

In O
my O
limited O
use O
of O
this O
computer O
I O
have O
been O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
lack O
of O
significant O
lag O
in O
routine O
use O
. O

I O
had O
attempted O
to O
clean O
my O
old O
keyboard O
with O
some O
window O
cleaner O
from O
an O
aerosol O
can O
. O

The O
initial O
page O
gives O
one O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
plays O
3D O
videos O
, O
but O
it O
's O
misleading O
and O
requires O
add O
- O
on O
devices O
( O
included O
) O
. O

Works O
as O
advertised O
, O
has O
operated O
all O
USB O
stuff O
I O
hooked O
up O
. O

I O
am O
currently O
using O
this O
on O
my O
old O
MSI O
Netbook O
running O
Windows O
8 O
Pro O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
very O
fast O
boot O
times O
. O

Plenty O
of O
room O
for O
Linux O
or O
XP O
though O
. O

Razer O
really O
should O
be O
ashamed O
of O
taking O
an O
otherwise O
exceptional O
machine O
and O
saddling O
it O
with O
a O
sub O
- O
quality O
display O
. O

Since O
the O
retina O
display O
version O
is O
slightly O
slimmer O
/ O
smaller O
than O
its O
aluminum O
unibody O
counterpart O
, O
the O
case O
is O
just O
a O
tad O
on O
the O
tall O
side O
. O

But O
wait O
... O
is O
n't O
the O
reason O
I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
DON'T O
HAVE O
A O
CD O
DRIVE O
ON O
MY O
COMPUTER O
! O
! O

I O
'm O
also O
glad O
the O
TV O
uses O
less O
energy O
than O
Plasma O
( O
reviews O
tend O
to O
down O
play O
this O

( O
By O
the O
way O
, O
this O
package O
came O
with O
the O
latest O
version O
of O
WinTV7 O
, O
v2 O
. O

Upon O
opening O
the O
box O
, O
I O
was O
first O
surprised O
by O
the O
build O
quality O
of O
the O
docking O
station O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
any O
of O
them O
work O
. O

This O
touchpad O
seemed O
to O
work O
well O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
listing O
all O
the O
features O
I O
am O
going O
to O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

I O
use O
it O
mainly O
for O
crowded O
links O
on O
web O
pages O
, O
but O
not O
much O
more O
. O

It O
's O
a O
really O
neat O
little O
tablet O
and O
my O
kids O
seem O
to O
like O
it O
a O
lot O
( O

I O
will O
update O
my O
review O
then.*Update O
2 O
days O

I O
have O
had O
this O
adapter O
since O
February O
of O
this O
year O
, O
and O
it O
still O
works O
wonderfully O
. O

None O
yet.***4-Month O
Update***- O
Wear O
now O
stands O
at O
4 O
. O

It O
is O
truly O
a O
shame O
, O
because O
the O
PB278Q O
is O
otherwise O
an O
excellent O
screen O
. O

Suddenly O
when O
you O
try O
to O
open O
it O
again O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
, O
because O
so O
much O
of O
it O
has O
been O
corrupted O
that O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
readable O
by O
your O
computer O
. O

I O
am O
a O
very O
satisfied O
customer O
. O

You O
will O
also O
have O
to O
exercise O
some O
care O
as O
the O
bag O
while O
padded O
is O
not O
as O
padded O
as O
others O
but O
with O
reasonable O
care O
this O
should O
be O
manageable O
. O

From O
my O
office O
, O
my O
WiFi O
enabled O
laptop O
does O
n't O
even O
show O
that O
the O
free O
network O
is O
there O
. O

nope O
i O
tried O
everything O
and O
nothing O
. O

Fits O
perfect O
as O
a O
replacement O
. O

If O
its O
dance O
rock O
most O
jazz O
or O
the O
like O
, O
you O
are O
n't O
going O
to O
miss O
much O
. O

So O
close O
Nokia O
. O

In O
looking O
at O
what O
others O
want O
for O
the O
same O
item O
the O
price O
is O
excellent O
. O

Easy O
installation O
, O
snapped O
into O
place O
, O
perfect O
fit O
. O

It O
plugged O
right O
into O
my O
laptop O
with O
no O
fit O
issues O
and O
appears O
to O
be O
working O
perfectly O
. O

Update O
: O
there O
may O
be O
a O
dual O
core O
version O
of O
this O
coming O
out O
soon O
. O

Flash O
Memory O
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
HD O
drives O
( O
great O
camcorder O
for O
automotive O
mounts O
) O
4 O
. O
) O

This O
means O
it O
tends O
to O
twist O
around O
. O

Ideal O
storage O
, O
fast O
retrieval O
and O
what O
not O
? O

Amazing O
battery O
life O
. O

and O
I O
expect O
that O
it O
will O
last O
. O

So O
, O
buyer O
beware O
. O

=) O
thus O
bridging O
the O
gap O
between O
windows O
and O
mac O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
placed O
the O
card O
into O
my O
computer O
( O
HP O
ze4101 O
) O
, O
it O
froze O
. O

I O
use O
all O
of O
these O
features O
! O

I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
Magsafe O
to O

I O
have O
since O
used O
it O
for O
not O
only O
the O
tablet O
, O
but O
for O
my O
kindle O
and O
iPhone O
which O
fully O
charged O
without O
putting O
even O
a O
dent O
in O
the O
remaining O
battery O
life O
of O
the O
energi O
to O
go O
battery O
. O

Has O
inline O
volume O
and O
mute O
but O
never O
use O
it O
. O

updated O
maps O
for O
this O
unit O
breathed O
at O
least O
2 O
more O
years O
into O
this O
unit O
.... O

I O
think O
this O
product O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
and O
worth O
the O
investment O
. O

The O
Twist O
has O
the O
traditional O
Thinkpad O
keyboard O
with O
mouse O
joystick O
and O
buttons O
above O
the O
touchpad O

It O
shuts O
off O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
for O
a O
bit O
. O

Not O
much O
else O
I O
can O
say O
about O
it O
. O

The O
fit O
and O
finish O
of O
this O
Chromebook O
is O
great O
. O

Apple O
will O
sell O
you O
a O
pretty O
one O
, O
but O
in O
most O
cases O
any O
cheap O
USB O
drive O
will O
do O
. O

But O
the O
transmitter O
is O
nice O
in O
that O
it O
's O
unobtrusive O
when O
used O
with O
my O
already O
- O
tiny O
Asus O
Aspire O
One O
netbook O
. O

Exactly O
what O
I O
ordered O
and O
worked O
perfect O
.... O
was O
so O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
am O
so O
happy O
that O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

It O
does O
speed O
things O
up O
quite O
a O
bit O
, O
streaming O
Netflix O
is O
no O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
now O
and O
finally O
set O
it O
up O
today O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
adapter O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O
and O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

BUTIt O
is O
expensive O
, O
with O
applecare O
, O
microsoft O
office O
and O
a O
vga O
adapter O

By O
having O
two O
adapters O
, O
you O
can O
plug O
your O
devices O
into O
different O
electrical O
outlets O
, O
rather O
than O
plugging O
everything O
into O
the O
same O
outlet O
and O
possibly O
blowing O
a O
fuse O
. O

it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

The O
delivery O
people O
( O
there O
were O
2 O
) O
brought O
the O
TV O
in O
, O
unpacked O
it O
and O
hooked O
it O
up O
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
great O
products O
, O
just O
pray O
nothing O
happens O
to O
your O
purchase O
. O

It O
will O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
Windows O
7 O
though O
. O

Fan O
really O
does O
n't O
cool O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
afer O
reading O
some O
reviews O
and O
encouraged O
after O
reading O
others O
, O
but O
I O
did O
NOT O
have O
any O
issues O
getting O
it O
to O
work O
with O
my O
Coby O
Kyros O
7-Inch O
Android O
2 O
. O

and O
I O
did O
not O
think O
this O
bag O
was O
too O
big O
by O
any O
stretch O
of O
the O
imagination O
. O

They O
were O
willing O
to O
send O
me O
a O
replacement O
unit O
, O
but O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
referb O
, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
return O
shipping O
of O
the O
original O
. O

I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
laptop O
now O
, O
but O
would O
n't O
purchase O
from O
HP O
again.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I O
consider O
myself O
a O
computer O
geek O
, O
but O
I O
was O
stuck O
with O
a O
5 O
year O
old O
solo O
core O
PC O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
of O
the O
unit O
is O
spectacular O
. O

But O
as O
far O
as O
an O
adventure O
in O
computing O
, O
I O
am O
having O
more O
fun O
with O
this O
computer O
, O
than O
I O
have O
had O
in O
15 O
years O
of O
computing O
. O

The O
original O
battery O
swell O
, O
and O
were O
replaced O
at O
no O
cost O
by O
Apple O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
rate O
this O
as O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
a O
5 O
is O
because O
the O
Anywhere O
Mouse O
by O
Logitech O
has O
improved O
on O
this O
mouse O
in O
so O
many O
ways O
it O
now O
reigns O
with O
my O
5 O
star O
" O
best O
in O
class O
" O
rating O
. O

The O
side O
/ O
front O
/ O
back O
pieces O
are O
also O
just O
a O
tad O
too O
wide O
. O

It O
charges O
fine O

Works O
perfectly O
with O
Nexus O
7 O
allowing O
use O
of O
USB O
drive O
for O
additional O
storage O
or O
for O
adding O
/ O
removing O
files O
from O
Nexus O
. O

I O
can O
not O
return O
them O
because O
I O
buy O
from O
Costa O
Rica O
and O
shipping O
is O
very O
high O
. O

Just O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
Vista O
found O
the O
drivers O
and O
away O
it O
went O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
still O
working O
fantastically O
for O
me O
. O

I O
recommend O
Monoprice O
9396 O
, O
they O
are O
cheap O
and O
sound O
good O
after O
being O
broken O
in O
by O
" O
pink O
noise".Battery O
life O
is O
also O
good O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
as O
advertised O
( O
~6 O
hours O
) O
. O

Note O
I O
never O
shut O
off O
the O
computer O
which O
would O
have O
extended O
the O
battery O
, O
but O
always O
just O
closed O
the O
cover O
which O
puts O
it O
into O
sleep O
mode O
. O

I O
've O
noticed O
this O
in O
my O
new O
SLR O
and O
now O
in O
this O
Canon O
. O

Worked O
without O
any O
problems O
but O
eventually O
was O
lost O
when O
we O
departed O
the O
plane O
. O

The O
touchscreen O
is O
also O
so O
responsive O
, O
that O
it O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
not O
reading O
a O
paper O
book O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
product O
is O
concerned O
you O
just O
need O
to O
be O
careful O
on O
how O
many O
hard O
drives O
are O
connected O
since O
those O
willdrain O
the O
current O
from O
the O
power O
supply O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
this O
bag O
( O
no O
pun O
intended O
) O
it O
is O
true O
. O

The O
tripod O
holder O
is O
convenient O
and O
keeps O
things O
in O
place O
when O
the O
bag O
is O
carried O
upright O
( O
the O
flap O
extends O
down O
from O
the O
base O
of O
the O
bag O
about O
9 O
" O
or O
so O
) O
. O

These O
are O
fun O
speakers O
, O
definitely O
different O
from O
any O
of O
the O
other O
speakers O
I O
own O
. O

Windows O
8 O
is O
running O
very O
smooth O
. O

Not O
an O
issue O
with O
this O
RAM O
, O
I O
installed O
it O
and O
I O
forgot O
about O
it O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

I O
loaded O
Microsoft O
Office O
2013 O

has O
the O
exact O
opposite O
problem O
. O

The O
other O
issue O
is O
the O
front O
cover O
, O
which O
is O
sort O
of O
aluminum O
laminate O
PAINTED O
, O
which O
means O
it O
scratches O
easily O
. O

Maybe O
1920 O
X O
1080 O
. O

Bit O
large O
in O
size O
but O
very O
functional O
. O

This O
alone O
was O
a O
deal O
- O
breaker O
for O
me O
. O

I O
have O
noticed O
marked O
slowdown O
since O
I O
removed O
it O
. O

After O
I O
brought O
it O
home O
, O
it O
really O
did O
a O
great O
job O
filling O
the O
room O
with O
powerful O
sound O
, O
with O
the O
ability O
to O
turn O
it O
up O
fairly O
loud O
without O
distortion O
. O

Just O
like O
Post O
- O
it O
notes O
, O
no O
residue O
is O
left O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

You O
can O
count O
on O
this O
case O
to O
be O
top O
of O
the O
line O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
it O
in O
your O
lap O
or O
on O
a O
desk O
top O
and O
be O
able O
to O
read O
your O
tablet O
. O

Now O
I O
can O
just O
push O
the O
switch O
and O
it O
's O
gone O
. O

And O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
internet O
connectivity O
; O
I O
have O
full O
bars O
right O
now O
, O
despite O
having O
a O
router O
on O
the O
opposite O
end O
of O
my O
house O
. O

For O
all O
the O
bad O
raps O

Get O
it O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

After O
February O
2009 O
this O
will O
be O
a O
moot O
point O
. O

The O
dock O
has O
a O
keyboard O
, O
a O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O

After O
use O
in O
more O
settings O
I O
did O
find O
that O
another O
reviewer O
's O
comment O
about O
awkwardness O
on O
different O
surfaces O
was O
true O
. O

I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
traveling O
over O
the O
holidays O
, O
and O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
test O
out O
this O
bag O
. O

I O
also O
had O
some O
trouble O
getting O
the O
blue O
tooth O
set O
up O
with O
it O
. O

The O
mCube O
has O
one O
connector O
for O
the O
computer O
and O
one O
USB O
port O
. O

While O
it O
does O
n't O
sound O
like O
your O
300 O
watt O
home O
stereo O
it O
can O
still O
fill O
up O
an O
average O
room O
with O
sound O
which O
makes O
it O
perfect O
for O
the O
office O
, O
bedroom O
or O
kitchen O
. O

( O
Note O
that O
the O
AUX O
adapter O
is O
not O
included O
. O
) O

My O
expectations O
as O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
sound O
provided O
by O
these O
speakers O
were O
quickly O
met O
. O

The O
receiver O
did O
not O
" O
fit O
" O
in O
any O
number O
of O
USB O
slots O
that O
I O
tried O
on O
multiple O
computers O
without O
great O
effort O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
, O
and O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
the O
cooler O
fits O
inside O
my O
laptop O
bag O
with O
the O
laptop O
, O
so O
I O
can O
carry O
both O
around O
without O
any O
hassle O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
folks O
find O
that O
watching O
full O
time O
in O
Game O
Mode O
is O
very O
pleasing O
. O

It O
was O
under O
warranty O
so O
when O
I O
contacted O
Targus O
they O
said O
" O
maybe O
my O
usb O
cable O
went O
bad O
" O
& O
that O
" O
this O
commonly O
happens O
. O
" O

Did O
this O
make O
a O
difference?????????Logitech O
make O
good O
products O
- O

Apparently O
the O
little O
blue O
adapter O
is O
n't O
proper O
for O
my O
Dell O
XP O

The O
system O
has O
two O
inputs O
- O
one O
is O
a O
male O
and O
the O
other O
( O
auxiliary O
input O
) O
is O
a O
female O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
that O
is O
n't O
something O
I O
do O
often O
while O
listening O
to O
music O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
commercial O
photographer O
in O
business O
since O
1976 O
and O
color O
accuracy O
is O
important O
to O
me O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
I O
've O
noticed O
is O
that O
after O
partitioning O
the O
hard O
drive O
, O
startup O
takes O
a O
little O
longer O
( O
around O
22 O
seconds O
total).The O
power O
cord O
is O
portable O
and O
extendable O
, O
while O
its O
nice O
to O
still O
have O
the O
optical O
drive O
, O
Ethernet O
port O
, O
and O
card O
slot O
. O

Now O
I O
need O
to O
figure O
out O
where O
and O
when O
I O
might O
use O
it O
. O

It O
gives O
me O
a O
strong O
reliable O
secure O
Hotspot O
. O

It O
's O
wonderful O
, O
but O
long O
. O

Apple O
needs O
to O
address O
this O
market O
on O
the O
IPad3 O
. O

and O
it O
works O
fine O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
n't O
technologically O
savvy O
. O

Photoshop O
Touch O
can O
sync O
files O
to O
Adobe O
Creative O
Cloud O
if O
you O
're O
a O
subscriber O
. O

I O
upgraded O
from O
the O
N770 O
to O
the O
N810 O
and O
am O
very O
impressed O
. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
quality O
cable O
, O
and O
it O
works O
. O

In O
addition O
the O
cord O
is O
very O
short O
between O
the O
computer O
and O
the O
first O
speaker O
. O

Works O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

BUT O
: O
The O
build O
/ O
construction O
is O
really O
shoddy O
. O

One O
broke O
after O
a O
month O
, O
and O
the O
replacement O
failed O
after O
a O
year O
. O

The O
material O
is O
more O
water O
resistant O
than O
the O
nylon O
backpacks O
I O
have O
, O
so O
unless O
it O
's O
a O
sustained O
downpour O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
taking O
it O
across O
the O
parking O
lot O
in O
the O
rain O
, O
and O
hurting O
the O
laptop O
inside O
. O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
, O
but O
it O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
out O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Nowhereville O
in O
Texas O
! O

Was O
the O
same O
as O
the O
dead O
one O
. O

This O
port O
should O
be O
install O
everywhere O
in O
any O
home O
! O

3- O
and O
HD O
brings O
incredible O
quality O
. O

The O
LED O
would O
n't O
come O
on O
and O
reader O
is O
not O
recognized O
, O
so O
I O
retruned O
to O
costco O
and O
got O
my O
money O
back O
( O
good O
thing O
it O
was O
from O
Costco O
) O
. O

Eve O
is O
very O
graphics O
heavy O

Would O
recommend O
to O
any O
Apple O
iMac O
user O
as O
a O
convenient O
desktop O
addition O
. O

I O
was O
very O
much O
against O
the O
idea O
of O
buying O
a O
netbook O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
ok O
, O
but O
I O
find O
using O
my O
earphones O
offer O
a O
much O
better O
sound O
in O
stero O
. O

The O
case O
is O
snug O
for O
a O
13 O
. O
3 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
prefer O
a O
brighter O
blue O
instead O
. O

The O
instructions O
also O
state O
that O
the O
speaker O
should O
not O
be O
exposed O
to O
sunlight O
, O
so O
once O
again O
you O
have O
to O
wonder O
about O
the O
outdoor O
claim O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
it O
's O
charged O
at O
all O
. O

" O
, O
" O
Did O
you O
follow O
the O
instructions O
? O
" O
, O
etc O
, O
etc O
. O

This O
is O
a O
problem O
known O
by O
LaCie O
, O
but O
they O
refuse O
to O
issue O
reliable O
power O
supplies O
, O
just O
using O
the O
same O
defective O
/ O
weak O
/ O
unreliable O
ones O
. O

but O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
sacrifice O
speed O
either O
. O

Since O
my O
husband O
is O
unemployed O
and O
I O
am O
still O
in O
school O

Visit O
their O
website O
for O
support O
. O

Only O
suggestion O
I O
have O
if O
purchasing O
this O
product O
is O
to O
also O
order O
a O
usb O
extension O
cable O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
for O
me O
is O
the O
ear O
buds O
do O
not O
fit O
snug O
in O
my O
ears O
. O

But O
it O
works O
grate O
and O
pretty O
fast O
. O

and O
i O
can O
use O
my O
15 O
. O
4 O
" O
laptop O
on O
it O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
is O
a O
beautiful O
laptop O
! O

The O
attention O
to O
detail O
is O
clear O
and O
whether O
playing O
games O
or O
just O
surfing O
the O
net O
, O
it O
's O
a O
joy O
to O
use O
. O

It O
works O
with O
USB2 O
and O
USB3 O
( O
crystaldiskmark O
for O
sdd O
samsung O
sm841 O

This O
is O
just O
a O
toy O
not O
a O
audio O
speaker O
. O

The O
wiring O
is O
to O
current O
standards O
. O

I O
keep O
my O
glasses O
, O
mouse O
, O
lunch O
, O
cables O
, O
phone O
... O
in O
it O
. O

After O
that O
, O
access O
is O
fast O
enough O
. O

Just O
all O
around O
cheaply O
made O
. O

I O
wanted O
one O
just O
for O
lite O
browsing O
, O
printing O
shipping O
labels O
and O
putting O
up O
store O
items O
. O

, O
it O
does O
n't O
look O
ridiculous O
and O
it O
did O
offer O
much O
more O
protection O

) O

My O

I O
knew O
it O
was O
time O
to O
upgrade O
my O
router O

but O
I O
got O
this O
on O
sale O
, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O

And O
in O
no O
time O
at O
all O
I O
discover O
how O
little O
use O
I O
actually O
make O
of O
a O
built O
- O
in O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
drive O
or O
an O
extra O
USB O
port O
. O

Sure O
enough O
the O
new O
device O
is O
fully O
functional O
and O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
many O
months O
with O
no O
issue O
. O

I O
have O
attempted O
to O
contact O
them O
starting O
a O
week O
after O
i O
got O
it O
as O
it O
started O
giving O
me O
problems O
. O

They O
do O
keep O
updating O
other O
stuff O
of O
the O
laptop O
though O
but O
still O
I O
like O
to O
keep O
my O
video O
drivers O
up O
to O
date.------------------------------------------------UPDATE O
15/7/2013:----------------------------------------------------------------------Well O
after O
almost O
a O
year O
of O
ownership O
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
'm O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
how O
Samsung O
handled O
this O
series O
or O
at O
least O
this O
model O
. O

There O
are O
many O
laptop O
sleeves O
out O
there O
. O

I O
recommend O
buying O
this O
device O
. O

All O
and O
all O
, O
nice O
backpack O
. O

Also O
, O
their O
cooling O
was O
not O
great O
, O
because O
most O
coolers O
have O
a O
single O
fan O
at O
the O
center O
. O

Why O
buy O
a O
$ O
20 O
samsung O
cable O
when O
one O
of O
these O
can O
be O
had O
for O
under O
$ O
4 O
? O

I O
went O
to O
the O
Zagg O
website O
and O
looked O
at O
their O
installation O
video O
. O

Considering O
the O
price O
, O
this O
is O
a O
really O
good O
product O
. O

this O
works O
great O
with O
all O
my O
electronics O
loved O
it O

I O
have O
had O
it O
2 O
months O
and O
use O
it O
a O
lot O
. O

and O
I O
have O
had O
many O
people O
comment O
on O
it O
. O

There O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
redeeming O
qualities O
that O
the O
1201N O
has O
, O
but O
you O
've O
read O
about O
that O
from O
all O
the O
other O
reviewers O

So O
I O
had O
to O
remove O
the O
tablet O
from O
the O
case O
when O
using O
it O
for O
geocaching O
and O
orienteering O
( O
yep O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
scout O
) O
. O

I O
did O
a O
ton O
of O
research O
and O
reading O
of O
reviews O
prior O
to O
finally O
giving O
in O
and O
purchasing O
a O
Netbook O
. O

Faster O
then O
Asus O
1201N. O
Better O
battery O
life O
. O

Display O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
blow O
you O
away O
but O
for O
$ O
250 O
it O
's O
definitely O
passable O
. O

Now O
my O
laptop O
1564 O
dell O
does O
not O
recognize O
AC O
adapter O
error O
and O
wo O
n't O
charge O
the O
battery O
. O

I O
need O
these O
to O
set O
up O
a O
secondary O
computer O
workstation O
and O
these O
fit O
the O
bill O
exactly O
. O

The O
Synergy O
is O
the O
perfect O
backpack O
for O
me O
. O

# O
2 O
was O
positioned O
underneath O
the O
RAM O
/ O
CPU O
access O
panel O
. O

The O
overall O
design O
is O
attractive O
with O
touches O
of O
stretchy O
fabric O
and O
padded O
shoulder O
straps O
and O
back O
panel O
. O

This O
review O
is O
slightly O
premature O
, O
as O
I O
have O
n't O
trail O
- O
tested O
the O
bag O
yet O
. O

Cons:-Because O
it O
is O
such O
a O
snug O
fit O
, O
it O
is O
actually O
quite O
difficult O
to O
get O
off O
. O

Buy O
this O
flash O
drive O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O

Most O

( O

will O
be O
OK O

it O
should O
say O
either O
on O

For O
these O

, O
it O
plays O
amazingly O
well O
with O
all O

on O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
you O
would O
make O
such O
a O
well O
built O
laptop O
and O
throw O
on O
such O
a O
cumbersome O
and O
seemingly O
fragile O
charger O
. O

They O
both O
look O
great O
over O

though O
. O

Overall O
, O
could O
n't O
ask O
for O
any O
more O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
about O
this O
thing O
melting O
, O
catching O
fire O
, O
etc O
. O

Fast O
Ethernet O
Card O
, O
sold O
by O
Amazon O
at O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
twice O
the O
price O
, O
which O
was O
also O
plug O
- O
and O
- O
play O
on O
Chromebook O
but O
gave O
a O
full O
30 O
Mbps O
download O
speed O
. O

The O
battery O
set O
- O
up O
is O
weird O
though O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
supplied O
by O
Altec O
Lansing O
and O
are O
Dolby O
Advanced O
. O

But O
a O
quick O
call O
to O
Amazon O
everything O
was O
fixed O
quick O
and O
was O
overnighted O
a O
replacement O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
how O
" O
cute O
" O
it O
is O
, O
how O
good O
it O
sounds O
, O
ask O
where O
I O
got O
it O
, O
how O
much O
it O
cost O
, O
etc O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
talk O
about O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
Chromebook O
, O
and O
I O
think O
many O
people O
have O
done O
a O
fantastic O
job O
of O
reviewing O
what O
they O
love O
and O
do O
n't O
love O
about O
the O
Chromebook O
. O

I O
would O
go O
so O
far O
to O
say O
that O
is O
almost O
an O
essential O
for O
trips O
. O

These O
straps O
wo O
n't O
break O
where O
a O
plastic O
buckle O
would O
. O

and O
so O
I O
send O
it O
again O
, O
only O
to O
reverse O
the O
command O
. O

Plenty O
of O
space O
for O
a O
lap O
top O
and O
accessories O
. O

Considering O
my O
last O
battery O
was O
$ O
80 O
, O
and O
the O
battery O
was O
garbage O
and O
would O
n't O
hold O
a O
charge O
. O

... O
lots O
of O

The O
drive O
actually O
" O
Fits O
" O
perfectly O
inside O
the O

, O
but O
since O
the O
outside O
is O
smaller O
the O
actual O

part O
of O
the O

now O
rests O

This O
is O
a O
great O
travel O
bag O
for O
the O
professional O
photographer O
or O
even O
a O
weekend O
amateur O
who O
likes O
to O
travel O
to O
get O
his O
shots O
. O

Guys O
showed O
up O
on O
time O
, O
unpacked O
it O
, O
put O
it O
where O
I O
wanted O
, O
turned O
it O
on O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
worked O
then O
took O
the O
box O
and O
walked O
out O
the O
door O
. O

As O
I O
started O
working O
on O
it O
, O
I O
was O
rather O
impressed O
by O
the O
keyboard O
. O

This O
is O
mitigated O
by O
the O
nicely O
padded O
carry O
handle O
, O
that O
suggests O
the O
owner O
may O
be O
old O
enough O
to O
vote:-).At O
the O
currently O
discounted O
price O
, O
do O
n't O
ask O
too O
much O
of O
this O
bag O
in O
demanding O
environments O
and O
it O
should O
cradle O
your O
laptop O
and O

I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
to O
find O
the O
best O
value O
at O
450 O
- O
500 O
$ O

at O
12 O
bucks O
including O
shipping O
the O
price O
was O
great O
too O
. O

So O
simple O
that O
even O
a O
child O
could O
use O
this O
camera O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
these O
plastic O
screen O
protectors O
as O
I O
am O
a O
careful O
user O
of O
my O
device O
and O
find O
these O
sort O
of O
things O
unnecessary O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
that O
they O
are O
working O
pretty O
well O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
red O
one O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
unavailable O
, O
but O
now O
I O
really O
like O
the O
grey O
one O
. O

SONY O
is O
the O
only O
other O
computer O
maker O
I O
could O
find O
with O
15 O
" O
notebooks O
with O
full O
1080p O
resolution O
, O
and O
they O
are O
on O
average O
$ O
500 O
more O
than O
this O
dell O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
have O
huge O
performance O
expectations O
and O
you O
'll O
come O
to O
love O
everything O
about O
these O
netbooks O
. O

Street O
Maps O
and O
Map O
Factor O

will O
usually O
- O
almost O
always O
, O
really O
- O
get O
you O
where O
you O
need O
to O
go O
, O
but O
the O
auto O

route O
that O
Navigator O
will O
present O
to O
you O
may O
or O
may O
not O
actually O
be O

" O
, O

or O

, O
I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
how O
much O
, O
if O
any O
, O
performance O
boost O
I O
would O
see O
. O

( O
Obviously O
a O
business O
suit O
would O
n't O
work O
well)--This O
bag O
is O
n't O
super O
lightweight O
, O
but O
it O
's O
so O
well O
built O

It O
's O
quiet O
and O
cool O
( O
runs O
cool O
and O
looks O
cool O
) O
. O

Really O
the O
only O
improvement O
I O
would O
suggest O
would O
be O
the O
sound O
quality O
of O
the O
speakers O
, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
nit O
. O

I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
it O
works O
really O
well O
, O
and O
this O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
other O
VHS O
units O
I O
have O
had O

The O
three O
year O
old O
battery O
in O
my O
computer O
was O
done O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
replace O
it O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
with O
Prime O
shipping O
. O

( O
College O

where O
ever O
you O
hang O
out O
to O
read O
, O
watch O
a O
video O
, O
or O
listen O
to O
music O
. O
) O

Setup O
is O
straightforward O
. O

It O
arrived O
quickly O
. O

There O
is O
some O
padding O
but O
not O
a O
huge O
amount O
to O
protect O
a O
big O
fall O
. O

It O
's O
not O
constant O
, O
just O
annoying O
when O
it O
occurs O
because O
it O
takes O
over O
my O
focus O
. O

I O
know O
that O
's O
hard O
to O
understand O
, O
but O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
the O
approach O
is O
n't O
very O
well O
implemented O
. O

But O
now O
, O
the O
cheapskate O
China O
people O
- O
when O
you O
hit O
cap O
key O
, O
am O
icon O
comes O
onscreen O
. O

and O
I O
clean O
two O
devices O
, O
several O
times O
a O
day O
. O

This O
one O
seems O
about O
just O
the O
right O
size O
and O
weight O
. O

When O
I O
finally O
got O
through O
-- O
by O
calling O
corporate O
and O
asking O
it O
to O
patch O
me O
through O
-- O
and O
threatened O
to O
tell O
my O
tale O
to O
local O
consumer O
reporters O
, O
the O
store O
managers O
miraculously O
and O
uncharacteristically O
made O
a O
smart O
move O
and O
gave O
me O
a O
brand O
spanking O
new O
Toshiba O

Contacting O
the O

was O
useless O

see O
you O
do O
that O

not O
care O

Two O
Heatshifts O
work O
just O
as O
well O
and O
do O
n't O
need O

: O
I O
tried O
out O
the O
heatshift O
13 O
and O
it O
is O
sized O
perfectly O
for O
a O
macbook O
pro O
13 O
. O

and O
I O
have O
also O
bought O
one O
to O
use O
for O
my O
blood O
pressure O
cuff O
and O
stethoscope O
. O

I O
definitely O
would O
recommend O
this O
Notebook O
Computer O
. O

A O
USB O
INPUT O

so O
I O
use O
this O
around O
the O
house O
and O
on O
the O
covered O
porch O
exclusively O
. O

A O
call O
to O
Customer O
Service O
was O
beyond O
goofy O
. O

3 O
Acer O
like O
a O
glove O
. O

then O
, O
it O
gets O
connected O
. O

The O
customizable O
buttons O
and O
touch O
ring O
really O
lets O
you O
get O
away O
from O
reaching O
for O
the O
keyboard O
as O
often O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
. O

but O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

I O
really O
like O
it O
. O

This O
hub O
works O
well O
. O

I O
use O
this O
card O
with O
a O
Canon O
G1 O
camera O
. O

Between O
this O
and O
it O
being O
JUST O
under O
5 O
lbs O
, O
it O
makes O
for O
an O
easy O
transport O
if O
you O
want O
a O
laptop O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
a O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
, O
but O
this O
model O
was O
specifically O
made O
for O
Walmart O
& O
discount O
stores O
, O
with O
the O
cheapest O
possible O
chip O
. O

The O
little O
spring O
- O
loaded O
buttons O
which O
are O
supposed O
to O
lock O
the O
sections O
do O
n't O
hold O
- O
making O
it O
useless O
as O
a O
tote O
and O
too O
heavy O
as O
a O
briefcase O
. O

I O
might O
get O
an O
hour O
when O
I O
is O
fully O
charged O
but O
most O
of O
the O
time O
it O
only O
last O
45 O
minutes O
before O
I O
have O
to O
plug O
the O
machine O
in O
. O

I O
got O
this O
for O
a O
MacBookPro O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
become O
more O
conscious O
of O
the O
noise O
from O
the O
3 O
fans O
but O
the O
cleverly O
installed O
power O
switch O
solves O
that O
issue O
, O
instead O
of O
having O
to O
unplug O
it O
as O
with O
other O
units O
. O

I O
followed O
the O
included O
directions O
and O
installed O
the O
card O
drivers O
and O
the O
included O
configuration O
software O
. O

I O
ai O
n't O
never O
going O
to O
lose O
no O
battery O
charger O
again O
. O

90watt O
adapter O
and O
stays O
cool O
. O

When O
I O
broke O
the O
Dell O
, O
they O
were O
all O
sweet O
as O
light O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
but O
soon O
as O
they O
got O
my O
computer O
back O
at O
my O
expense O
, O
I O
got O
a O
letter O
denying O
the O
claim O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
bright O
and O
keyboard O
types O
very O
well O
. O

Boot O
time O

wake O
up O

If O

and O
I O
'll O

they O
insist O
that O
my O

is O
to O

Plus O
, O
the O

still O
had O
an O
almost O
complete O
charge O
in O
it O
! O

I O
belong O
to O
many O

like O
to O

up O
and O

. O

I O
'm O
not O
using O
any O
kind O
of O
liquid O
cooling O
with O
this O
PSU O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
computer O
and O
would O
love O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
but O
for O
the O
way O
the O
display O
is O
designed O
and O
the O
jumpiness O
and O
inconsistent O
response O
of O
the O
touchpad O
I O
'm O
giving O
it O
4 O
stars O
. O

In O
4 O
to O
6 O
months O
I O
may O
come O
back O
and O
write O
a O
new O
review O
about O
its O
performance O
at O
that O
time O
as O
well O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
the O
price O
of O
this O
particular O
unit O
, O
however O
, O
and O
the O
GOLD O
certification O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

My O
twin O
sent O
me O
a O
Kindle O
Fire O
8 O
. O
9 O
" O
, O
and O
it O
does O
everything O
that O
the O
netbook O
did O
. O

To O
maximize O
the O
potential O
of O
these O
speakers O
, O
place O
them O
as O
close O
to O
ear O
- O
level O
as O
possible O
( O
but O
not O
as O
close O
to O
your O
ears O
as O
possible O
, O
of O
course O
) O
. O

i O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
to O
ASUS O
3 O
times O
before O
it O
came O
back O
working O
consistently O
( O
would O
not O
turn O
on).I O
love O
it O
again O
now O
that O
it O
works O
, O
but O
i O
am O
nervous O
that O
it O
will O
quit O
again O
. O

I O
have O
read O
a O
lot O
of O
threads O
about O
the O
Intel O
NUC O
being O
very O
finicky O
about O
what O
memory O
it O
would O
work O
with O
, O
and O
was O
very O
wary O
of O
this O
memory O
. O

Steve O
Jobs O
is O
DeadIf O

And O
, O
it O
prints O
instantaneously O
. O

I O
suppose O
the O
only O
upside O
is O
that O
the O
drivers O
were O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

Hit O
the O
power O
button O
and O
by O
the O
time O
you O
have O
had O
your O
first O
sip O
of O
coffee O
it O
is O
connected O
. O

My O
original O
keyboard O
had O
a O
broken O
key O
and O
a O
few O
other O
wobblers O
( O
laptop O
was O
bought O
in O
2006 O
) O
so O
I O
was O
really O
glad O
to O
find O
this O
replacement O
at O
a O
great O
price O
-- O
way O
cheaper O
than O
going O
through O
Dell O
. O

Looks O
like O
a O
quality O
build O
. O

these O
cables O
work O
just O
fine O
, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
audio O
, O
you O
may O
want O
to O
get O
the O
ones O
with O
the O
audio O
cable O
, O
or O
jack O
that O
is O
already O
connected O
within O
the O
main O
cable O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
it O
provide O
a O
longer O
power O
- O
on O
capacity O
, O
but O
it O
adds O
a O
feature O
that O
raises O
the O
laptop O
about O
an O
inch O
to O
a O
better O
viewing O
angle O
. O

Sturdy O
construction O
. O

Can O
not O
be O
done O
on O
this O
unit O
. O

The O
first O
service O
shop O
never O
contacted O
me O
... O

Both O
of O
those O
machines O
have O
the O
pointer O
buttons O
as O
part O
of O
the O
touch O
pad O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
separate O
toggle O
type O
button O
used O
on O
the O
Asus O
. O

3 O
( O
loaded O
with O
pics O
, O
music O
, O
Microsoft O
Office O
, O
etc O
) O

I O
expect O
I O
will O
be O
using O
this O
bag O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
second O
keyboard O
had O
the O
same O
issues O
, O
and O
now O
, O
a O
few O
months O
later O
I O
notice O
that O
it O
is O
cracked O
and O
the O
plastic O
that O
goes O
between O
the O
keys O
pulls O
right O
up O
along O
the O
hairline O
crack O
. O

This O
device O
would O
not O
convert O
HDMI O
to O
analog O
video O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
since O
it O
is O
workable O
again O
, O
I O
increased O
it O
to O
2 O
stars O
. O

Does O
what O
it O
is O
meant O
to O
do O
and O
works O
perfectly O
with O
my O
LG O
47LW6500 O
! O

Anyway O
, O
I O
probably O
wo O
n't O
use O
this O
protector O
for O
that O
long O
given O
the O
rubbery O
feel O
and O
lack O
of O
real O
glare O
reduction O
. O

In O
closing O
this O
is O
the O
best O
HD O
1080P O
television O
I O
ever O
watched O
. O

The O
design O
makes O
it O
so O
different O
usb O
plugs O
are O
n't O
crowding O
each O
other O
. O

, O
I O
recommend O
them O
, O
they O
were O
worth O
my O
money O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
they O
'll O
be O
worth O
yours O
. O

So O
, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
it O
's O
not O
white O
, O
but O
a O
matte O
silver O
. O

can O
fit O
the O
power O
cord O
in O
outside O
pocket O
. O
or O
headphones O
or O
screen O
wipes O
. O

Read O
the O
fine O
print O
on O
this O
-- O
this O
product O
does O
not O
convert O
or O
reduce O
electrical O
voltage O
-- O
essentially O
what O
this O
does O
is O
provide O
a O
physical O
way O
for O
( O
insert O
your O
country O
's O
) O
plug O
to O
fit O
into O
( O
insert O
destination O
country O
's O
) O
plug O
. O

but O
it O
is O
going O
back O
because O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
spend O
6 O
or O
7 O
minutes O
trying O
to O
turn O
something O
on O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
useful O
product O
. O

The O
issue O
became O
progressively O
worse O
and O
more O
frequent O
until O
it O
was O
replaced O
by O
HP O
. O

The O
price O
was O
soooo O
much O
lower O
than O
all O
of O
the O
other O
stores O

I O
am O
by O
no O
means O
a O
hard O
core O
gamer O

Now O
I O
ca O
n't O
run O
it O
unless O
I O
pull O
the O
wire O
somehow O
and O
keep O
the O
USB O
plugged O
at O
an O
odd O
angle O
. O

Bought O
this O
and O
got O
a O
discount O
with O
other O
mediabridge O
products O
, O
one O
reason O
we O
love O
AMAZON O
so O
much O
! O

So O
, O
I O
decided O
that O
I O
would O
need O
to O
get O
2 O
bags-- O
one O
for O
my O
day O
out O
excursions O
and O
another O
for O
my O
week+ O
long O
vacations O
when O
I O
am O
away O
from O
home O
. O

Not O
sure O
why O
some O
reviewers O
had O
such O
a O
hard O
time O
with O
it O
. O

Product O
does O
n't O
seem O
like O
it O
would O
hold O
up O
well O
under O
normal O
wear O
. O

There O
's O
also O
no O
Ethernet O
port O
( O
given O
how O
thin O
it O
is O
) O
, O
no O
optical O
drive O
( O
which O
might O
be O
a O
plus O
for O
you O
) O
, O
and O
no O
external O
media O
card O
reader O
. O

When O
I O
got O
this O
item O
, O
it O
was O
the O
kind O
that O
has O
very O
small O
wires O
internally O
. O

That O
means O
that O
once O
they O
're O
on O
, O
they O
're O
also O
difficult O
to O
take O
off O
. O

If O
yours O
fits O
, O
congrats O
- O
good O
for O
you O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
as O
a O
cheap O
alternative O
to O
paying O
the O
high O
replacement O
costs O
manufacturers O
expect O
. O

The O
recent O
sequel O
was O
fun O
as O
well O
, O
and O
when O
I O
noticed O
the O
Monster O
Tron O
Light O
Disk O
Audio O
Dock O
on O
Amazon O
I O
immediately O
coveted O
it O
. O

Bought O
V20 O
and O
tried O
it O
on O
my O
Hp O
WIndows O
PC O
, O
Sony O
Laptop O
and O
Mac O
Mini O
. O

That O
's O
a O
big O
step O
up O
while O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
type O
right O
now O
! O

The O
lights O
eventually O
got O
flickery O
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
worst O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
it O
. O

The O
reason O
I O
give O
this O
a O
4 O
is O
because O
it O
came O
with O
some O
marks O
on O
it O
. O

( O
yeah O
, O
the O
advertised O
6h O
is O
a O
bit O
exaggerated O
, O
but O
4 O
. O
5 O
is O
still O
plenty).- O
Enough O
processor O
power O
to O
handle O
Vista O
/ O
Win O
7 O
and O
basic O
apps O
without O
stuttering.- O
Excellent O
webcam O
- O
truly O
optimized O
for O
low O
light.- O
Almost O
full O
size O
keyboard O
, O
except O
2 O
keys O
( O
see O
below).Not O
- O
so O
- O
pros:- O

Perfect O
fit O
, O
perfect O
look O
, O
perfect O
feel O
, O
and O
perfect O
price O
. O

I O
have O
purchased O
a O
small O
laptop O
( O
netbook O
type O
) O
for O
use O
as O
a O
large O
tablet O
. O

I O
do O
like O
the O
pictures O
taken O
with O
the O
rear O
5Mpxl O
camera O
. O

- O
Eh O
also O
a O
let O
down O
after O
2 O
- O
3 O
hours O

I O
got O
from O
RadioShack O

The O
Z130 O
's O
are O
somewhat O
smaller O
than O
the O
S120 O
's O
and O
sell O
for O
just O
about O
the O
same O
price O
. O

* O
Appears O
* O
to O
be O
solidly O
built O
. O

I O
received O
this O
headset O
through O
the O
Vine O
Program O
and O
have O
really O
enjoyed O
using O
it O
. O

THRILLED O
in O
fact O
since O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
laptop O
when O
the O
reviews O
are O
often O
so O
depressing O
and O
Windows O
8 O
looks O
like O
a O
bear O
. O

The O
" O
Touch O
Media O
Controls O
" O
for O
things O
like O
the O
volume O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
buttons O
you O
push O
) O
are O
a O
little O
odd O
at O
first O
but O
we O
got O
used O
to O
them O
quickly O

Took O
it O
home O
, O
initial O
impression O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
sounds O
quite O
close O
to O
the O
UE O
mobile O
boombox O
. O

With O
this O
cooler O
, O
even O
running O
the O
most O
taxing O
programs O
, O
my O
computer O
barely O
breaks O
a O
sweat O
! O

The O
1000HE O
comes O
with O
StarOffice O
and O
Skype O
pre O
- O
installed O
. O

Toshiba O
has O
teamed O
with O
Skype O
and O
therefore O
the O
camera O
is O
set O
specially O
for O
this O
service O
. O

Price O
has O
gone O
up O
, O
so O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
now O
.... O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Meaning O
no O
duplicate O
, O
each O
will O
run O
as O
an O
extension O
. O

so O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
more O
friction O
now O
that O
the O
protector O
's O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
have O
asked O
for O
a O
better O
experience O
in O
purchasing O
this O
replacement O
battery O
from O
Amazon O
. O

It O
does O
the O
job O
and O
it O
only O
cost O
$ O
20 O
. O

holds O
all O
the O
assorted O
accessories O
I O
need O
. O

The O
range O
is O
surprisingly O
good O
. O

Completely O
portable O
. O

Acer O
Aspire O
One O
10 O
. O

, O
none O
of O
them O
fix O
any O
of O
the O
HP O
laptops O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

I O
've O
been O
a O
dedicated O
Canon O
customer O
most O
of O
my O
life O
. O

I O
do O
wish O
there O
was O
a O
little O
more O
room O
( O
not O
too O
much O
because O
I O
would O
cram O
too O
much O
in O
) O
to O
include O
some O
peripherals O
for O
use O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
device O
through O
Amazon O
. O

There O
are O
some O
drops O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
care O
about O
since O
the O
price O
is O
perfect O
. O

Also O
the O
laptop O
just O
is O
n't O
any O
more O
reliable O
than O
my O
other O
laptop O
which O
cost O
me O
much O
less O
. O

. O
1 O
and O
a O
Linux O
user O
since O
at O
least O
Red O
Hat O
Linux O
6 O

It O
's O
become O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
my O
criticisms O
over O
the O
size O
, O
weight O
, O
and O
battery O
life O
of O
this O
laptop O
were O
very O
minor O
nits O
. O

Those O
of O
you O
who O
received O
a O
bad O
battery O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
's O
the O
seller O
's O
fault O
.. O
be O
sure O
to O
ask O
them O
for O
a O
good O
battery O
. O

This O
seems O
like O
the O
ideal O
place O
for O
your O
laptop O
's O
power O
adapter O
. O

Another O
annoying O
thing O
is O
the O
blue O
LED O
indicator O
light O
when O
discharging O
. O

that O
made O
her O
very O
happy O
- O
good O
pricing O
tooso O

I O
'm O
no O
computer O
nerd O

I O
did O
notice O
a O
slight O
lowering O
of O
volume O
in O
using O
it O
in O
battery O
mode O
as O
opposed O
to O
with O
the O
AC O
plugged O
in O
. O

A O
tablet O
should O
be O
zippy O
and O
responsive O
and O
the O
500 O
T O
is O
! O

A O
light O
internet O
device O
with O
a O
reasonably O
small O
screen O
that O
was O
dead O
cheap O
. O

Naming O
conventions O
aside O
, O
I O
would O
still O
have O
to O
give O
the O
mouse O
good O
reviews O
, O
why O
? O

Would O
I O
get O
another O
one O
if O
I O
need O
to O
? O

The O
extension O
bar O
seems O
strong O
and O
does O
not O
twist O
as O
one O
would O
think O
. O

so O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
for O
the O
price O
and O
value O
. O

It O
fit O
just O
the O
same O
as O
the O
original O
and O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
detection O
either O
. O

Allowed O
it O
to O
recharge O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
turned O
on O
w/o O
problem O
. O

Video O
quality O
is O
very O
poor O
, O
HDMI O
only O
work O
for O
a O
few O
old O
Tv O
's O
sets O

Unless O
you O
need O
a O
number O
pad O
, O
this O
is O
perfect O
for O
your O
tablets O
if O
you O
would O
rather O
have O
a O
real O

At O
the O
price O

at O

, O
I O
'd O
rather O
plug O

I O
just O
leave O
the O

to O
have O
some O

with O

2 O

I O
would O

it O
again O

Whether O
you O
like O
the O
new O
design O
or O
not O
is O
subjective O
, O
but O
it O
does O
retain O
the O
thinness O
( O

and O
is O
actually O

've O
taken O
this O

on O

It O
did O
n't O

The O
price O
is O

If O
mine O

I O
would O
shell O
out O
another O
$ O
400 O
for O
a O
new O
one O
without O
a O
moment O

It O
was O

for O

I O

run O
into O
that O
problem!*Speakers O
: O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
say O
much O
about O

that O
I O
like O
their O
location O
which O
is O
at O
either O

and O
thus O
gets O
out O
of O

you O

carefully O

make O
sure O
it O

Would O
recommend O

with O
the O

configuration O
would O
have O
costed O
me O
more O
than O
1000 O
USD O
if O
I O
were O
to O
buy O
it O
here O
. O

Bluetooth O
should O
be O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
not O
the O
freaking O
nightmare O
it O
is O
here O
. O

Thick O
and O
sturdy O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
nice O
soft O
cushion O
on O
the O
bottom O
so O
when O
you O
do O
have O
the O
laptop O
on O
your O
lap O
its O
comfy O
. O

Got O
this O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
a O
friend O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
her O
own O
account O
. O

These O
keyboard O
covers O
usually O
stretch O
out O
of O
shape O
. O

TERRIBLE O
for O
flights O
! O

The O
only O
downside O
I O
came O
accross O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
Cruz O
reader O
. O

Long O
story O
short O
, O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
business O
or O
pleasure O
unless O
you O
need O
something O
with O
all O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O

But O
like O
i O
said O
before O
I O
have O
two O
of O
these O
one O
for O
my O
large O
ipad O
and O
one O
for O
my O
mini O
iPad O
these O
cases O
are O
light O
weight O
and O
great O
. O

Once O
the O
correct O
drivers O
were O
installed O
the O
connection O
was O
quick O
and O
simple O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
a O
very O
quiet O
fan O

I O
love O
the O
see O
through O
look O
so O
that O
every O
light O
shines O
through O
, O
just O
enough O
to O
see O
it O
. O

I O
do O
plan O
to O
come O
back O
and O
revise O
as O
my O
impressions O
change O
. O

It O
can O
also O
be O
a O
pain O
to O
reconnect O
after O
charging O
or O
when O
the O
connection O
is O
lost O
. O

Very O
rarely O
in O
todays O
world O
do O
you O
find O
an O
honest O
and O
reputable O
company O
that O
wants O
your O
business O
enough O
to O
contact O
the O
customer O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
transaction O
was O
acceptable O
...... O

This O
device O
can O
not O
be O
configured O
to O
half O
duplex O
protocol O
, O
although O
its O
chip O
is O
capable O
. O

All O
in O
all O
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
best O
Cooler O
I O
've O
owned O
, O
but O
it O
could O
easily O
be O
better O
, O
with O
better O
construction O
and O
quieter O
operation O
... O

I O
had O
another O
that O
hung O
out O
the O
side O
and O
got O
bumped O
, O
breaking O
the O
board O
inside O
package O
. O

Ergonomics O
, O
was O
certainly O
a O
key O
factor O
in O
planning O
the O
design O
of O
this O
lap O
desk O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
paid O
for O
a O
lemon O
. O

Good O
value O
for O
the O
price O
. O

2 O
GB O
Memory O

No O
driver O
needed O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
, O
and O
I O
will O
get O
the O
17 O
" O
version O
for O
my O
PC O
notebook O
. O

but O
they O
should O
n't O
be O
low O
enough O
to O
make O
this O
power O
strip O
think O
it O
is O
in O
standby O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
cool O
protective O
case O
so O
now O
the O
power O
cable O
only O
goes O
one O
direction O
. O

So O
I O
figured O
why O
not O
go O
with O
something O
cheap O
. O

and O
when O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
the O
reception O
was O
horrible O
and O
the O
range O
was O
barely O
10 O
ft O
with O
no O
obstructions O
. O

This O
should O
work O
well O
, O
considering O
I O
'm O
giving O
the O
laptop O
away O
. O

As O
for O
the O
smell O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
bad O
. O

To O
get O
around O
that O
use O
a O
program O
called O
Quickeys O
by O
Startly O
( O
both O
for O
Mac O
and O
Windows O
) O
. O

See O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

It O
's O
also O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
the O
Anker O
looks O
great O
, O
very O
Apple O
- O
like O
product O
design O
. O

The O
bag O
has O
a O
main O
compartment O
, O
small O
fleece O
lined O
pocket O
, O
second O
expandable O
compartment O
, O
outside O

, O
2 O
vertical O

( O
small O
) O
, O
two O
outside O
zipper O
pockets O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
and O
a O
small O
Ipod O
pocket O
on O
the O
top O
neckside O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

stick O
together O
( O
with O
magnets O
) O
. O

The O
function O
keys O
provide O
important O
functionality O
you O
will O
enjoy O
when O
using O
with O
your O
iPad O
... O
you O
can O
control O
music O
( O

So O
the O
best O
bag O
for O
me O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
for O
you O
. O

If O
you O

this O
one O
is O
really O
very O
good O

the O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
with O
my O
external O
drive O
, O
I O
have O
to O
take O
it O
out O
and O
plug O
it O
into O
my O
machine O
instead O
. O

This O
is O
highly O
suspicious O
and O
smells O
of O
fraud O
. O

It O
helps O
to O
avoid O
clutter O
of O
wires O
and O
chargers O
on O
the O
nightstand O
that O
we O
have O
beside O
our O
bed O
. O

They O
claim O
that O
when O
overlapped O
, O
it O
leads O
to O
1280x720 O
images O
, O
but O
each O
eye O
is O
still O
only O
seeing O
a O
640x720 O
image O
. O

I O
use O
it O
to O
read O
approximately O
10 O
DVDs O
a O
week O
, O
each O
DVD O
one O
to O
two O
hours O
long O
. O

I O
use O
it O
to O
power O
a O
5 O
volt O
video O
camera O
and O
a O
12 O
volt O
router O
for O
remote O
video O
. O

The O
laptop O
already O
cost O
more O
than O
a O
grand O
, O
they O
chose O
to O
milk O
as O
much O
money O
from O
you O
as O
possible O
by O
excluding O
a O
hardware O
part O
that O
cost O
a O
buck O
at O
most O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
could O
n't O
add O
a O
fourth O
USB O
port O
onto O
this O
humongous O
thing).Otherwise O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
laptop O
, O
albeit O
quite O
large O
and O
heavy O
for O
the O
15 O

sure O
what O
the O

way O
would O

that O
I O

One O
thing O
I O
noticed O
though O
, O
is O
that O
it O
's O
very O
easy O
for O
this O
case O
to O
get O
dirty O
. O

I O
do O
not O
see O
any O
benefit O
in O
this O
compared O
to O
my O
older O
router O
, O
that O
was O
supposedly O
" O
slower O
" O
and O
less O
expensive O
. O

so O
I O
purchased O
directly O
from O
them O
. O

There O
is O
no O
extra O
space O
for O
an O
adapter O
or O
anything O
. O

It O
installed O
easily O
( O
as O
memory O
should O
) O
, O
and O
works O
fine O
. O

Somebody O
in O
the O
company O
should O
have O
said O
: O
Stop O
! O
and O
fix O
it O
. O

Upon O
closer O
examination O
, O
I O
found O
the O
internal O
shield O
/ O
sleeve O
was O
n't O
made O
properly O
. O

It O
's O
a O
slim O
case O
so O
room O
for O
notebook O
, O
power O
cord O
and O
a O
few O
office O
staples O
. O

I O
can O
deal O
with O
it O
until O
the O

What O
can O
I O
say O

do O

The O
only O
half O
- O
complaint O
I O
have O
about O
the O
bag O
stems O
from O
its O
ultra O
- O
compact O
nature O
. O

I O
spent O
a O
long O
time O
looking O
for O
a O
camera O
bag O
that O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
a O

bag O
. O

The O
IM3C O
has O
exceeded O
all O
my O
expectations O
. O

I O
was O
a O
bit O
skeptical O
of O
the O
cooling O
pads O
and O
figured O
that O
they O
mostly O
worked O
by O
elevating O
the O

allowing O

favorite O

G62 O
started O
showing O
a O
flashing O
orange O
battery O
light O
about O
one O
month O
later O
. O

I O
've O
been O
tempted O
to O
see O
if O
I O
can O
get O
the O
media O
server O
in O
the O
factory O
firmware O
to O
stream O
to O

I O
bought O
these O
for O
ultralight O
backpacking O
and O
organization O
of O
toolbox O
and O
junk O
drawer O
. O

If O
you O
can O
deal O
with O
a O
mediocre O
processor O
and O
battery O
life O
( O
and O
of O

this O

a O
great O

pero O

el O

The O
absurd O
thing O
is O
, O
some O
people O
are O
so O
Apple O
- O
deluded O
as O
to O
suggest O
that O
a O
" O
workaround O
" O
is O
to O
carry O
the O
laptop O
with O
you O
wherever O
you O
go O
, O
even O
for O
5 O
minutes O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
or O
to O
grab O
a O
coffee O
. O

After O
I O
saw O
the O
quality O
comparison O
between O
the O
jvc O
hd O
camcorder O
and O
the O
canon O
vixa O
HF10 O
........... O
the O
Canon O
picture O
quality O
was O
breathtaking O
. O

The O
only O
complaint O
I O
have O
with O
this O
mouse O
is O
middle O
button O
which O
you O
have O
to O
push O
down O
a O
little O
harder O
on O
the O
top O
for O
it O
to O
" O
click O
" O
but O
that O
's O
normal O
with O
most O
wheels O
that O
scroll O
side O
to O
side O
, O

and O
I O
hope O
they O
really O
reconsider O
either O
how O
they O
market O
their O
products O
and/or O
work O
on O
getting O
some O
better O
tech O
support O
that O
does O
n't O
just O
refer O
you O
to O
buy O
another O
product O
or O
call O
another O
manufacturer O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
problem O
they O
should O
be O
helping O
you O
resolve O
. O

I O
spent O
$ O
200 O
more O
on O
my O
previous O
laptop O
and O
only O
got O
half O
as O
many O
options O
as O
this O
one O
. O

I O
got O
this O
pad O
after O
trying O
some O
others O
, O
and O
i O
wish O
i O
had O
just O
gottent O
his O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Oh O
, O
remember O
do O
n't O
buy O
the O
little O
PS/2 O
to O

I O
am O
an O

No O
need O
to O
pay O
for O
installation O
or O
the O
hassle O
of O
opening O
a O

to O
get O
the O
convenience O
of O
Bluetooth O

. O

Love O
it O
that O
it O
is O
rechargeable O
also O

I O
have O
found O
that O
it O
charged O
both O
devices O
quickly O
.. O
and O
for O
sure O
not O
slowThe O
only O
thing O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
the O
devices O
must O
be O
plugged O
into O
the O
correct O
ports O
and O
the O
charger O
must O
be O
plugged O
into O

. O

This O
just O
pushes O
in O
and O
there O
is O
so O
much O

It O
is O
also O
a O
very O

so O
I O
would O
n't O
choose O
this O
as O
a O
primary O
gaming O
machine O
( O
and O

After O
about O
12 O
months O
, O
parts O
started O
to O
go O
bad O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
dissatisfied O

ear O

and O
both O
had O
horrible O
sound O
unless O
you O
do O

quite O
push O
them O
all O
the O
way O
into O
the O

. O

The O
material O
makes O
it O
look O
more O
expensive O
than O
it O
really O
is O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
smal O
portable O
keyboard O
to O
use O
with O
my O
Kindle O
Fire O

, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
a O
mini O
keyboard O

Easy O
to O
replace O
. O

Ok O
, O
so O
it O
's O
my O
first O
LCD O

TV O

This O
bag O
will O
fit O
my O
laptop O
and O
even O
a O
change O
of O
clothes O
& O
shoes O
. O

I O
took O
the O
dive O
away O
from O
a O
full O
OS O
! O

Windows O

is O
good O
and O
4 O

I O
bought O
this O
from O
a O
local O

with O
the O
intention O
of O
playing O

* O
The O
bag O
is O
a O
bit O
bulky O
and O
can O
seem O
cumbersome O
when O
fully O
loaded O
, O
but O
if O
it O
was O
n't O
this O
size O
, O
there O
would O
n't O
be O
as O
much O
storage O
space O
, O
so O
really O
it O
's O
a O
trade O

off O

Furthermore O

the O

no O

whatsoever O

Heck O
, O
even O
the O

it O
came O
in O
was O
quality O

I O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
put O
my O
fairly O
heavy O
Sony O

. O
5 O
" O
laptop O
( O
magnesium O

When O
I O
opened O
the O
package O
, O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
" O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
I O
paid O
$ O
20 O
for O
a O
ratty O
, O
plastic O
envelope O
. O

You O
know O
you O
want O
it O
. O

That O
s O
when O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
told O
myself O
not O
to O
waste O
another O
minute O
on O
this O
. O

But O
overall O
, O
it O
's O
a O
handy O
, O
flexible O
, O
well O
made O
laptop O
backpack O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
recommend O
taking O
a O
long O
look O
at O
it O
, O
particularly O
if O
the O
MP3 O
wiring O
feature O
is O
useful O
to O
you O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
NV52 O
then O
this O
will O
work O
with O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
going O
with O
a O
different O
product O
that O
met O
my O
needs O
. O

ftw O
if O
this O
thing O
is O
still O
20 O
$ O
, O
throw O
in O
a O
hard O
drive O
enclosure O
and O
you O
've O
got O
a O
perfect O
free O
shipment O
. O

and O
I O
like O
the O
flexible O
microphone O
. O

The O
ability O
to O
adjust O
the O
screen O
in O
to O
almost O
any O
desired O
position O
is O
no O
to O
be O
under O
appreciated O
. O

This O
device O
came O
with O
the O
URL O
to O
Intel O
's O
driver O
site O
, O
so O
I O
went O
ahead O
and O
downloaded O
the O
drivers O
before O
I O
shut O
down O
the O
laptop O
to O
perform O
the O
upgrade O
. O

There O
is O
a O
slightly O
more O
yellow O
( O
not O
like O
yellow O
- O
yellow O
, O
just O
not O
that O
bright O
white O
of O
Nexus O
/ O
tablets O
) O
to O
the O
screen O
that O
concerned O
me O
, O
but O
again O
, O
even O
that O
seems O
to O
make O
more O
sense O
for O
extended O
typing O
, O
etc O
- O
it O
is O
just O
not O
as O
bright O
/ O
straining O
on O
your O
eyes O
. O

Nice O
design O
and O
overall O
great O
bag O
for O
a O
15 O
. O
6 O
" O
or O
smaller O
laptop O
/ O
notebook O
. O

The O
couple O
things O
that O
are O
weak O
is O
the O
air O
flow O
when O
it O
is O
set O
on O
high O
( O
on O
low O
, O
the O
air O
barely O
moves).It O
is O
a O
little O
pricey O
and O
for O
the O
price O
you O
think O
there O
should O
have O
been O
7 O
more O
rows O
of O
holes O
in O
it O
for O
the O
cooling O
of O
the O
battery O
compartment O
, O
that O
gets O
really O
hot O
and O
there O
should O
be O
at O
least O
3 O
extra O
fans O
one O
more O
at O
the O
top O
and O
two O
towards O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
rely O
on O
my O
laptop O
quite O
a O
bit O
every O
day O
and O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
have O
a O
back O
up O
to O
it O
and O
something O
smaller O
for O
day O
trips O
when O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
lug O
around O
a O
17&#34 O
; O
laptop O
but O
my O
iPhone O
or O
iPad O
were O
n't O
enough O
to O
do O
the O
job O
. O

It O
is O
that O
simple O
to O
install O
. O

I O
use O
HDMI O
connection O
through O
the O
cable O
company O
's O
box O
and O
get O
PIP O
through O
that O
so O
do O
n't O
need O
that O
supplied O
by O
the O
tv O
. O

I O
disabled O
this O
immediately O
and O
installed O
windows O
7I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
getting O
Windows O
7 O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
I O
found O
it O
to O
be O
much O
more O
usable O
after O
that O
, O
however O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
you O
need O
to O
install O
the O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
drivers O
in O
order O
to O
get O
the O
port O
to O
work O
under O
Windows O
7 O
, O
but O
that O
was O
n't O
difficult O
to O
hunt O
down O
and O
install O
. O

My O

Is O
a O
Microsoft O

At O
first O
I O
was O
pleased O
to O
see O

anything O

help O

8 O
OF O
5THIS O
LITTLE O
NOTEBOOK O

It O
's O
very O
convenient O
to O
not O
have O
to O
dig O
out O
the O
adapter O
that O
came O
with O
my O
Ultrabook O
from O
the O
maze O
of O
wires O
under O
my O
desk.(I O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
turn O
off O
thelight O
unless O
you O
unplug O
it O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
worse O
bluetooth O
devices O
then O
this O
one O
. O

I O
used O
it O
during O
our O
beach O
vacation O
to O
turn O
the O
pool O
into O
a O
party O
zone O
. O

As O
always O
Amazons O
replacement O
policy O
is O
the O
very O
best O
, O
and O
they O
are O
shipping O
me O
a O
new O
one- O
should O
be O
here O
next O
week O
. O

It O
will O
last O
you O
years O
with O
proper O
care O
. O

I O
really O
like O
how O
they O
can O
be O
washed O
and O
reused O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
find O
this O
board O
on O
Amazon O
for O
only O
$ O
30 O
. O

And O
it O
does O
just O
that O
, O
although O
I O
am O
somewhat O
dubious O
as O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
DHS O
will O
allow O
the O
bag O
to O
go O
through O
with O
the O
computer O
still O
inside O
. O

and O
I O
dare O
say O
that O
the O
physical O
RAM O
runs O
faster O
than O
with O
the O
stock O
chip O
! O

I O
love O
this O
surface O
pad O
for O
my O
mac O
air O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
much O
for O
the O
price O
i O
got O
it O
at O
but O

VERY O
fast O
, O
up O
to O
8 O
gb O
of O
RAM O
, O
execellent O
design O
, O
great O
battery O
life O
, O
great O
for O
photo O
and O
video O
editingCONS O
: O

Sadly O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
return O
this O
laptop O
, O
not O
taking O
chance O
on O
3k O
for O
a O
lemon O
. O

I O
chose O
the O
safe O
route O
and O
got O
the O
8 O
GB O
HP O
flash O
drive O

so O
I O
hope O
to O
get O
as O
least O
a O
few O
years O
out O
of O
it O
. O

, O
so O
i O
returned O
it O
and O
got O
the O
rubberized O
cover O
instead O

Original O
review O
: O
So O
I O
've O
ripped O
all O
my O
Blu O
- O
rays O
to O
my O
( O
Mac O
) O
computer O
, O
now O
, O
with O
this O
drive O
and O
it O
worked O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
about O
4 O
months O
now O

I O
have O
had O
tons O
of O
webcams O
and O
never O
been O
impressed O
until O
now O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
batteries O

Buy O
the O
ones O
from O
Amazon O
local O
rather O
than O
uxcell O
. O

I O
have O
it O
on O
High O
Performance O
. O

I O
honestly O
am O
not O
that O
concerned O
if O
the O
fan O
dies O
. O

I O
got O
this O
today O
, O
and O
I O
do O
have O
to O
say O
that O
for O
the O
price O
of O
the O
case O
it O
is O
actually O
pretty O
nice O
. O

This O
was O
slightly O
disappointing O
for O
me O
, O
since O
I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
it O
can O
hold O
any O
( O
thin O
) O
laptop O
less O
than O
14 O
. O
1 O
inches O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
fit O
mine O
. O

I O
was O
hoping O
it O
would O
fit O
into O
my O
book O
bag O
that O
easily O
fits O
my O
15 O
. O

problem O
so O
far O
is O
the O

with O
Windows O

. O

I O
just O
already O
have O
a O
500gig O
black O
one O
that O
I O
use O

The O
stand O
is O
definitely O
a O
bonus O
addition O

my O
old O
external O

works O
about O
the O

For O
a O
while O
it O
would O
load O
Windows O
after O
a O
power O
shutdown O
and O
a O
reboot O
, O
but O
then O
it O
stopped O
doing O
that O
. O

I O
do O
like O
that O
the O
touch O
pad O
does O
n't O
scroll O
to O
the O
left O
or O
right O
on O
the O
page O
, O
a O
design O
on O
the O
Dell O
netbooks O
that O
people O
end O
up O
complaining O
about O
more O
than O
finding O
efficiency O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
a O
simple O
device O
, O
and O
it O
does O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
do O
and O
is O
reasonably O
priced O
, O
so O
what O
else O
can O

a O
very O

The O

, O
though O
, O
works O
great O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

The O
built O
- O
in O
speakers O
are O
n't O
great O
, O
but O
are O
more O
than O
adequate O
for O
gaming O
purposes O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
undecided O
on O
what O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
option O
to O
carry O
my O
laptop O
along O
too O
when O
I O
travel O
! O

I O
would O
jiggle O
the O
wire O
and O
the O
problem O
would O
go O
away O
only O
to O
return O
the O
next O
time O
I O
moved O
my O
head O
or O
would O
remove O
the O
headphones O
from O
my O
head O
. O

( O
Black O
) O
and O
got O
all O
my O
backups O
and O
machines O
sorted O
- O

Seems O
to O
be O
a O
nice O
sturdy O
keyboard O
and O
case O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
DisplayLink O
software O
for O
the O
AOC O
USB O
display O
I O
purchased O
to O
extend O
my O
laptop O
's O
display O
was O
incompatible O
with O
the O
J5 O
Ultra O
Station O
I O
had O
( O
recently O
purchased O
) O
been O
using O
. O

These O
25 O

work O
really O

the O

quality O
is O
great O

them O

I O
have O

none O

it O
just O
worries O
me O
that O
its O

I O
create O
a O
lot O
of O
videos O
and O
store O
a O
lot O
of O
music O
on O
my O
laptop O
and O
my O
750 O
GB O
onboard O
drive O
is O
maxing O
out O
. O

It O
is O
an O
inexpensive O
generic O
brand O
of O
the O
highest O
quality O
that O
meets O
if O
not O
beats O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
more O
expensive O
brands O
. O

When O
school O
is O
in O
session O
and O
I O
have O
to O
travel O
for O
work O
, O
I O
carry O
my O
work O
laptop O
( O
because O
I O
have O
to O
) O
and O
my O
MAC O
just O
so O
I O
can O
complete O
my O
coursework O
and O
not O
have O
to O
use O
my O
work O
PC O
to O
do O
it O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
wait O
to O
get O
this O
but O
after O
two O
days O
, O
was O
disappointed O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
before O
a O
two O
week O
trip O
to O
Kenya O
and O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
problem O
with O
connecting O
anything O
to O
it O
including O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
, O
everything O
powers O
nicely O
from O
it O
. O

Compare O
that O
with O
Samsung O
. O

I O
think O
that O
touchpad O
in O
$ O
1 O
, O
400 O
machine O
could O
be O
more O
reliable O
. O

Good O
price O
. O

an O
L. O
L. O
Bean O
sling O
bag O
that O
holds O
the O
computer O
, O
power O

, O

, O
optical O

, O

, O
mini O
USB O

, O

and O
cooling O
pad O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
weighs O
less O
than O
a O
six O
pack O
of O
bad O
beer O
. O

You O
have O
to O
cover O
the O
$ O
50 O
shipping O
, O
but O
for O
$ O
1200 O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

big O
mistake O
/ O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

So O
while O
this O
does O
not O
replace O
my O
battle O
- O
scarred O
( O
and O
much O
more O
unwieldy O
) O

about O
10 O
- O
15 O
seconds- O
i O
assume O
this O
is O
from O
starting O
the O
device O
drivers O
and O
activating O
the O
device O
. O

It O
has O
class O
, O
it O
's O
chic O
, O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
any O
professional O
on O
the O
go O
. O

That O
was O
extremely O
annoying O
to O
me O
as O
I O
'm O
a O
rapid O
typist O
and O
to O
have O
to O
continualy O
go O
find O
a O
way O
back O
to O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
, O
did O
n't O
exactly O
please O
me O
. O

She O
loves O
the O
webcam O
and O
the O
memory O
and O
video O
card O
are O
fantastic O
. O

I O
had O
another O
cover O
that O
was O
impossible O
to O
pop O
off O
. O

so O
it O
's O
simply O
not O
worth O
the O
risk O
. O

best O
price O
out O
side O
of O
my O
town O
---best O

Only O
downside O
it O
is O
little O
hard O
to O
insert O
in O
express O
card O
slot O
( O
put O
one O
scratch O
on O
mouse O
due O
to O
rubbing O
with O
upper O
of O
slot O
) O
& O
price O
( O
yes O
costly O
compare O
to O
logitech O
& O
microsoft O
) O

I O
imagine O
if O
someone O
REALLY O
wants O
your O
monitor O
they O
will O
find O
some O
way O
to O
get O
it O
. O

much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
we O
had O
before O
. O

I O
can O
plug O
and O
play O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
drivers O
for O
in O
Linux O
. O

So O
overall O
, O
I O
have O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

The O
included O
Glowball O
game O
has O
amazing O
graphics O
. O

The O
mini O
ends O
are O
very O
well O
made O
and O
the O
cable O
it O
self O
is O
stout O
. O

Arrived O
just O
in O
time O
for O
weekend O
of O
work O
which O
must O
be O
delayed O
. O

Awesome O
find O
! O
! O

Despite O
my O
disdain O
for O
this O
set O
, O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
when O
it O
worked O
the O
picture O
quality O
was O
great O
in O
HD.*****UPDATE*****I O
finally O
gave O
in O
and O
took O
my O
set O
to O
one O
of O
the O
repair O
shops O
that O
Samsung O
suggested O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
added O
a O
little O
" O
home O
button O
sticker O
" O
that O
came O
with O
a O
screen O
protector O
kit O
; O
problem O
solved O
. O

When O
plugged O
in O
you O
get O
nice O
HD O
video O
from O
an O

when O
you O
're O
plugged O
in O
) O

from O
an O

Perfect O
for O
everything O
a O
netbook O
should O
do O
and O
even O
useable O
as O
a O
' O
real O
' O
laptop O
with O
some O
foresight O
and O
planning O
. O

This O
is O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
sleeve O
is O
such O
an O
attractive O
design O
. O

And O
hopefully O
it O
will O
stay O
on O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
everyone O
who O
says O
this O
is O
junk O
. O

I O
definitely O
found O
a O
winner O
with O
this O
router O
. O

I O
put O
them O
in O
the O
sleeve O
before O
sliding O
them O
into O
a O
very O
lightweight O
carrying O
case O
. O

Still O
it O
fits O
well O
and O
looks O
nice O
. O

but O
I O
have O
always O
preferred O
using O
a O
mouse O
. O

I O
recently O
purchased O
a O
second O
one O
to O
leave O
at O
work O
and O
everyone O
loves O
charging O
their O
phones O
with O
it O
. O

Structurally O
, O
it O
does O
feel O
like O
a O
" O
my O
first O
webcam O
" O
toy O
; O
almost O
entirely O
plastic O
. O

Design O
- O
wise O
, O
there O
is O
very O
, O
very O
little O
to O
complain O
about O
. O

The O
restricted O
UI O
sometimes O
leaves O
you O
wanting O
. O

Even O
a O
tripod O
plate O
looks O
big O
on O
the O
camcorder O

I O
have O
gotten O
many O
compliments O
on O
it O
. O

This O
camcorder O
is O
going O
to O
last O
me O
a O
very O
long O
time O

it O
has O

A O

A O
couple O
of O
other O
reviewers O
have O
noted O
that O
this O
pack O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
and O
the O
build O

seems O
to O
suggest O
they O
are O
correct O

For O
the O
price O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
's O
great O
. O

I O
recommend O
Corel O

. O

I O
was O
kind O
of O
reluctant O
because O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
made O
of O
cheap O
plastic O
and O
had O
a O
unconvincing O
glossy O
black O
paint O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
keep O
this O
brief O
. O

I O
know O
that O
some O
people O
have O
complained O
about O
the O
Sling O
but O
for O
me O
it O
has O
worked O
flawlessly O
on O
my O
iphone O
and O
my O
ipad O
( O
I O
just O
watch O
and O
pause O

the O
only O
gripe O
is O
that O
the O
cord O
from O
the O
outlet O
to O
the O
adapter O
falls O
out O
very O
easily O
. O

As O
far O
as O
performance O
, O
it O
runs O
circles O
around O
my O
recent O
model O
Belkin O
hub O
that O
went O
over O
the O
deep O
end O
. O

Somewhere O
between O
the O
MBAir O
and O
old O
MBPRO O
. O

-- O
I O
was O
left O
assured O
that O
the O
performance O
on O
one O
of O
these O
nice O
little O
systems O
was O
going O
to O
be O
where O
I O
wanted O
it O
to O
be O
at O
. O

Make O
certain O
the O
camera O
is O
turned O
off O
when O
switching O
the O
card O
on O
or O
off O
to O
avoid O
corruption O
of O
the O
files O
on O
the O
card O
. O

Very O
cool O
looking O
, O
and O
just O
the O
right O
size O
. O

A O
touch O

would O
make O
it O
perfect O

me O
! O

NETFLIX O
look O
really O

Thanks O
Google O
! O

I O
prefer O
matte O
to O
glossy O
screens O

I O
made O
one O
unfortunate O
discovery O
when O
setting O
up O
this O
laptop O
- O
the O
power O
plugs O
into O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
case O
. O

I O
biggest O
concerns O
was O
, O
does O
it O
have O
enough O
space O
to O
fit O
all O
my O
gadgets O
and O
chargers O
and O
protect O
my O
Laptop O
from O
abuse O
. O

It O
checks O
through O
security O
easily O

I O
have O
a O
big O
, O
round O
head O
and O
the O
headset O
was O
loose O
. O

Dimension O
: O
almost O
the O
same O
. O

99 O
purchase O
price O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
design O
the O
bottom O
back O
corners O
are O
loose O
but O
should O
n't O
cause O
a O
problem O
unless O
something O
happens O
to O
get O
snagged O
in O
between O
the O
case O
and O
the O
laptop O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
flexible O
and O
the O
molded O
micro O
USB O
connector O
is O
better O
quality O
than O
many O
I O
have O
seen O
. O

Oh O
well O
... O

I O
've O
considered O
upgrading O
to O
a O
retina O
MBP O
, O
but O
I O
just O
love O
the O
17&#34 O
; O
monitor O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
planning O
on O
using O
this O
as O
my O
music O
player O
. O

We O
have O
it O
set O
up O
as O
an O
ethernet O
bridge O
for O
our O
Western O
Digital O
media O
center O
and O
wireless O
repeater O
. O

Overall O
the O
case O
/ O
shell O
feels O
like O
what O
a O
non O
- O
name O
company O
would O
make O
, O
or O
like O
a O

. O

Love O
MediaBridge O
! O

works O
amazing O

Now O
I O
have O
1 O
charger O
and O
a O
killer O
cool O
cable O
that O
will O
charge O
my O
ipad O
and O
my O
micro O
- O
usb O
phone O
. O

Note O
that O
from O
a O
nearly O
dead O
state O
it O
took O
me O
almost O
10 O
hours O
to O
charge O
it O
fully O
from O
a O
PC O
USB O
port O
. O

When O
I O
tried O
the O
transmitter O
elsewhere O
, O
it O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

Adds O
just O
a O
little O
size O
, O
but O
still O
fits O
into O
my O
snug O
little O
case O
. O

and O
they O
are O
individually O
wrapped O
which O
is O
nice O
for O
keeping O
them O
clean O
until O
use O
. O

I O
turned O
the O

so O
it O
clicked O
on O
and O
the O

n't O
know O
how O
long O
the O
elastic O
strips O
will O
last O
, O
but O
, O
so O
far O
so O
good O
when O
it O
wears O
out O
I O
will O
get O
another O
one O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
drive O
for O
secure O
backup O
and O
it O
failed O
during O
the O
first O
week O
of O
use O
. O

and O
I O
'll O
put O
in O
a O
screaming O
fast O
256gig O
SSD O
, O
and O
for O
this O
model O
it O
is O
confirmed O
that O
you O
can O
upgrade O
to O
16gig O
.. O

( O
any O
help O
there O
would O
be O
appreciated O
, O
I O
am O
doing O
alot O
of O
research O
, O
but O
ca O
nt O
seem O
to O
find O
what O
I O
need O
to O
buy O
. O

and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

I O
tried O
some O
of O
the O
other O
suggested O
fixes O
via O
Device O
Manager O
, O
such O
as O
switching O
the O
flow O
to O
hardware O
and O
reducing O
the O
receive O
and O
transmit O
buffers O
to O
1 O
, O
but O
my O
laptop O
still O
crashed O
and O
I O
get O
an O
DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL O
BSOD O
computer O
crash O
. O

but O
I O
received O
a O
new O
adapter O
from O
the O
seller O
and O
this O
one O
works O
perfectly O
. O

The O
first O
drive O
is O
for O
data O
and O
the O
second O
is O
to O
back O
up O
the O
first O
one O
. O

I O
'm O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

The O
charger O
connector O
stopped O
charging O
within O
3 O
weeks O
. O

Great O
value O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Lot O
of O
junk O
cables O
; O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
Blue O
Rigger O
products O
. O

So O
IF O
you O
are O
budget O
conscious O
in O
any O
way O
or O
need O
your O
computer O
to O
be O
future O
proof O
for O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
of O
years O

If O
you O
, O
however O
, O
do O
n't O
need O
all O
that O
and O
are O
simply O
looking O
for O
a O
stylin O
' O
communication O
and O
Microsoft O
Office O
system O
, O
I O
'd O
take O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
the O
Dell O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
good O
... O
but O
all O
things O
considered O
, O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
bought O
another O
brand O
. O

Very O
well O
made O
, O
high O
quality O
cable O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
rich O
and O
full O
with O
base O
you O
could O
swear O
you O
can O
feel O
. O

I O
kept O
it O
in O
a O
small O
box O
that O
came O
with O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
other O
reviewers O
who O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
this O
battery O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
fit O
quite O
as O
snugly O
as O
it O
should O
. O

There O
is O
an O
annoying O
compatibility O
issue O
between O
the O
two O
Syba O
SATA O
to O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
adapters O
that O
I O
own O
with O
my O
host O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O

And O
this O
new O
processor O
is O
a O
total O
beast O
too O
. O

I O
paid O
$ O
65 O
. O
00 O
from O
a O
local O
dealer O
and O
it O
keeps O
telling O
me O
that O
it O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
power O
to O
charge O
the O
battery O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
even O
the O
cheapest O
Bluetooth O
speakerphone O
and O
audio O
devices O
are O
capable O
of O
pairing O
to O
at O
least O
two O
devices O
, O
so O
for O
the O
money O
spent O
, O
this O
is O
a O
let O
down O
. O

LaCie O
wants O
me O
to O
pay O
them O
more O
money O
to O
send O
it O
in O
, O
on O
my O
dime O
, O
and O
have O
them O
replace O
it O
with O
another O
piece O
of O
junk O
. O

this O
was O
actually O
appropriate O
for O
, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
price O
and O
figured O
I O
'd O
try O
it O
. O

As O
with O
everything O
, O
the O
price O
varies O
. O

RPM O
( O
should O
n't O
be O
complaining O
because O
I O
new O
it O
before O
I O
made O
purchase O
) O
, O
could O
be O
upgraded O
to O
SSD2 O
. O

I O
added O
this O
card O
to O
a O
desktop O
computer O
with O
only O
a O
10/100/ O
LAN O
port O
and O
an O
available O
PCIe O
x1 O
slot O
. O

There O
is O
no O
addition O
software O
to O
load O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

this O
applies O
to O
any O
messenger O
bag O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
put O
off O
by O
the O
graphical O
START O
page O
. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
is O
user O
friendly O
and O
has O
loads O
of O
potential O
. O

Room O
for O
a O
mouse O
and O
power O
cord O
. O

I O
'm O
done O
trying O
. O

On O
a O
side O
note O
there O
is O
another O
model O
that O
has O
a O
battery O
option O
for O
an O
additional O
$ O
100 O

I O
bet O
I O
am O
not O
the O
only O
one O
experiencing O
this O
. O

This O
AC O
Adapter O
has O
the O
proper O
bullet O
tip O
on O
it O
. O

The O
display O
would O
switch O
to O
power O
saving O
mode O
when O
connected O
to O
the O
adapter O
. O

It O
also O
deals O
well O
with O
my O
macbook O
. O

After O
some O
intial O
Set O
- O
Up O
problems O
this O
company O
stepped O
up O
to O
the O
plate O
& O
came O
through O
for O
me O
by O
providing O
" O
Amazing O
Customer O
Service O

This O
means O
that O
I O
will O
have O
to O
throw O
out O
a O
perfectly O
good O
laser O
printer O
. O

These O
are O
actually O
awful O
. O

and O
I O
needed O
to O
power O
some O
streetlamps O
for O
a O
Christmas O
village O
I O
maintain O
. O

I O
only O
have O
two O
issues O
with O
this O
product O
. O

I O
put O
on O
the O
carbon O
fiber O
protector O
and O
did O
a O
much O
better O
job O
with O
it O
the O
second O
time O
. O

too O
small O
( O
note O
: O

Once O
this O
unit O
is O
out O
of O
warranty O
, O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
and O
luck O
before O
it O
's O
useless.======= O

I O
suppose O
people O
were O
complaining O
about O
the O
battery O
life O
being O
too O
long O
. O

The O
throughput O
on O
the O
5GHz O
cards O
pegs O
our O
internet O
connection O
in O
the O
mid-30s O
where O
this O
card O
speed O
tested O
in O
the O
low O
20s O
to O
mid O
20s O
range O
. O

Dropped O
right O
into O
the O
slot O
and O
works O
very O
well O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
did O
n't O
give O
it O
five O
stars O
is O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
physical O
ethernet O
port O
, O
which O
disappointed O
me O
. O

and O
now O
I O
don&#8217;t O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
my O
laptop O
overheating O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
location O
of O
the O
power O
button O

It O
does O
come O
with O
a O
chest O
belt O
( O
but O
not O
with O
a O
hip O
belt O
however O
) O
that O
is O
not O
placed O
low O
enough O
on O
the O
carrying O
supports O
, O
but O
at O
least O
the O
tension O
imposed O
on O
your O
chest O
can O
be O
readily O
adjusted O
. O

" O
BUT O
work O
perfectly O
when O
plugged O
directly O
into O
the O
PC O
or O
the O
hub O
continually O
cuts O
on O
and O
off O
a O
device O
. O

I O
also O
listened O
to O
a O
CNN O
video O
. O

and O
it O
puts O
my O
screen O
at O
a O
perfect O
height O
. O

This O
works O
great O
for O
keeping O
my O
iPod O
powered O
while O
I O
enjoy O
my O
day O
at O
a O
free O
wifi O
spot O
without O
lugging O
in O
my O
laptop O
. O

Of O
course O
there O
are O
other O
mitigating O
factors O

but O
I O
imagine O
it O
works O
for O
it O
's O
intended O
purpose O
. O

It O
worked O
great O
, O
allowing O
me O
to O
share O
music O
to O
all O
of O
my O
Bluetooth O
speakers O
easily O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
girlfriend O
for O
xmas O
. O

This O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
and O
effort O
for O
me O
- O

I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O

You O
might O
also O
need O
a O
10 O
foot O
mini O
cable O
to O
connect O
the O
sound O
. O

I O
own O
a O
HP O
Pavilion O
Elite O
. O

hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
me O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
, O
especially O
for O
travelers O
. O

The O
light O
on O
the O
hub O
is O
very O
bright O
. O

It O
might O
not O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
deal O
to O
take O
your O
laptop O
out O
and O
place O
it O
in O
the O
tray O
, O
but O
this O
is O
just O
so O
much O
easier O
when O
you O
're O
dealing O
with O
crowds O
and O
you O
already O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
emptying O
your O
pockets O
. O

Being O
a O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
Surface O
Pro O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
buying O
several O
bags O
over O
time O
. O

; O
( O
do O
a O
google O
search O
to O
see O
the O
difference O
) O
. O

I O
read O
a O
lot O
of O
reviews O
. O

The O
extra O
RAM O
is O
nice O
--- O
it O
means O
paging O
on O
my O
iMac O
moves O
from O
being O
a O
rare O
occurrence O
to O
a O
non O
- O
existent O
occurrence O
, O
and O
allows O
that O
much O
more O
file O
system O
data O
to O
be O
stored O
in O
RAM;- O
iMac O
will O
show O
the O
speed O
of O
your O
combined O
system O
( O
if O
you O
bought O
only O
two O
sticks O
, O
not O
four O
) O
as O
1333 O
MHz O
, O
not O
1600;- O

The O
bad O
: O
Attached O
USB O
storage O
transfer O
is O
very O
slow O
. O

The O
K340 O
is O
however O
, O
a O
vast O
improvement O
over O
the O
Wave O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nice O
laptop O
but O
with O
the O
Glass O
on O
top O

As O
such O
, O
it O
lasts O
almost O
a O
full O
10 O
hours O
under O
light O
useage O
- O
heavy O
useage O
, O
I O
suspect O
, O
could O
reduce O
that O
to O
closer O
to O
4 O
- O
5 O
hours O
- O
whereas O
the O
stock O
battery O
, O
under O
light O
useage O
, O
will O
last O
no O
more O
than O
two O
hours O
, O
with O
a O
corresponding O
reduction O
on O
time O
for O
heavy O
use O
. O

the O
adapter O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

Performance O
so O
far O
has O
been O
great O
, O
picture O
color O
and O
clarity O
is O
perfect O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
perfect O
, O
but O
it O
's O
as O
close O
as O
you O
are O
going O
to O
find O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
the O
envy O
of O
all O
who O
see O
you O
using O
it O
. O

I O
personally O
use O
it O
for O
my O
mobile O
external O
hard O
drive O
( O
for O
backups O
) O
, O
mp3 O
player O
, O
printer O
, O
and O
usb O
thumb O
drives O
. O

The O
xtra O
bonus O
is O
the O
four O
adjustable O
LED O
lights O
. O

There O
is O
no O
time O
to O
reposition O
the O
wire O
holder O
. O

Unless O
this O
TV O
has O
a O
break O
in O
period O
, O
which O
the O
manufacturer O
says O
it O
does O
n't O
, O
and O
it O
gets O
fixed O
, O
i O
will O
return O
it O
. O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
it O
to O
come O
with O
a O
small O
case O

Have O
had O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
now O

However O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
the O
pen O
I O
would O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
Asus O
transformer O
, O
or O
and O
iPad O
( O
although O
I O
personally O
dislike O
apple O
products).Pro's:-The O
stylus O
is O
really O
the O
big O
advantage O
of O
this O
tablet O
. O

If O
it O
seems O
to O
stop O
working O
, O
remove O
the O
offending O
devise O
immediately O
. O

For O
Vista O
, O
and O
its O
successor O
Windows O
7 O
, O
to O
better O
compete O
against O
the O
Mac O
OS O
in O
the O
laptop O
market O
space O
, O
it O
needs O
to O
greatly O
enhance O
its O
battery O
life O
and O
substantially O
lower O
its O
heat O
output O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

You O
can O
use O
this O
device O
as O
a O
remote O
ethernet O
that O
connects O
to O
your O
wifi O
router O
and O
then O
offers O
an O
ethernet O
port O
to O
connect O
a O
device O
to O
your O
network O
. O

I O
might O
add O
that O
I O
bought O
the O
Acer O
720 O
model O
with O
4 O
GB O
RAM O
. O

However O
, O
the O
screen O
still O
is O
crisp O
and O
beautiful O
for O
a O
non O
- O
retina O
screen O
. O

Much O
lighter O
than O
the O
factory O
original O
that O
came O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

for O
$ O
12 O
, O
I O
should O
not O
expect O
the O
world O
. O

And O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
smaller O
. O

by O
UPS O
tracking O

This O
thing O
is O
perfect O
- O
lightweight O
- O
long O
battery O
- O
fast O
- O
great O
display O
- O
good O
memory O
when O
expanded O
to O
2 O
gb O
( O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
) O

Purchased O
it O
for O
my O
daughter O

I O
feel O
like O
my O
mac O
has O
some O
protection O
, O
plus O
it O
does O
n't O
slide O
quite O
as O
easily O
. O

and O
it O
fits O
the O
connector O
on O
the O
Aspire O
as O
described O

As O
I O
find O
out O
from O
her O
that O
she O
wants O
one O
, O
I O
chose O
this O
one O
because:- O

Once O
when O
the O
fan O
clunked O
out O
. O

In O
my O
mind O
, O
the O
real O
question O
is O
the O
QC O
on O
drive O
production O
... O
is O
this O
drive O
built O
to O
last O
, O
or O
another O
dud O
? O

Its O
pretty O
bad O
. O

The O

so O
this O
problem O
can O
be O
fixed O
easily O
... O
maybe O
the O
matte O
version O
is O
better)- O
Booting O
time O
becomes O
a O
little O
bit O
slower O
as O
time O
passes O
( O
it O
used O
to O
boot O
up O
real O
fast O
but O
now O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
slower O
... O
not O
TOO O
slow O

I O
was O
attracted O
to O
the O
compact O
design O
because O
of O
the O
limited O
area O
in O
my O
Volvo O
S40 O
's O
center O
console O
. O

( O
Those O
who O
ca O
n't O
plug O
personal O
electronics O
like O
an O
iPod O
into O
their O
work O
computer O
systems O
for O
security O
reasons O
, O
might O
find O
this O
handy O
. O
) O

I O
am O
using O
this O
a O
PC O
monitor O
cable O
to O
an O
LED O
display O
. O

The O
interface O
just O
reminds O
me O
of O
users O
that O
would O
put O
all O
kinds O
of O
shortcuts O
on O
their O
desktop O
, O
way O
too O
cluttered O
for O
my O
taste O
. O

This O
pack O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
carrying O
these O
extra O
items O
as O
a O
single O
airline O
carry O
- O
on O

While O
the O
overall O
quality O
of O
this O
backpack O
is O
first O
rate O
, O
however O
, O
the O
handle O
sewn O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fabric O
is O
inadequate O
. O

This O
was O
a O
nice O
extra O
feature O
, O
as O
I O
can O
connect O
to O
my O
external O
display O
without O
any O
adapters.- O
The O
size O
. O

The O
skins O
protected O
against O
scratches O
, O
but O
nothing O
else O
. O

I O
have O
changed O
my O
rating O
from O
one O
star O
to O
three O
. O

It O
kind O
of O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
having O
a O
remote O
if O
you O
have O
to O
walk O
over O
to O

fm O
qty O
sucks O
lol O
but O
at O
least O
its O
a O
usb O
charger O

I O
can O
slip O
it O
in O
quickly O
, O
know O
that O
it O
is O
protected O
and O
it O
is O
not O
bulky O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

I O
've O
purchased O
these O
drives O
twice O
. O

no O
input O
lag O
and O
the O
colors O
are O
amazing O
. O

I O
do O
understand O
that O
theoretically O
that O
is O
not O
possible O
because O
the O
optical O
sensor O
only O
tracks O
movements O
of O
the O
surface O
it O
is O
on O
regardless O
of O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Bluetooth O
radio O
source O
, O
but O
I O
wo O
n't O
also O
be O
leaving O
this O
review O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
convinced O
of O
the O
discovered O
flaw O
after O
doing O
multiple O
tests O
. O

I O
use O
my O
tablet O
for O
work O
so O
this O
becomes O
the O
wifi O
that O
I O
need O
to O
get O
my O
work O
done O
. O

Works O
fine O
for O
toshiba O
laptop O
. O

It O
would O
also O
be O
nice O
if O
it O
were O
wireless O
, O
but O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
everything O
. O

The O
book O
and O
the O
speakers O
were O
shipped O
separately O
( O
and O
arrived O
on O
separate O
days).Unfortunately O
, O
Galactics O
( O
or O
whoever O
did O
the O
actual O
shipping O
) O
packed O
these O
speakers O
in O
a O
HUGE O
box O
which O
was O
loosely O
filled O
with O
packing O
paper O
. O

This O
case O
is O
the O
best O
computer O
bag O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
it O
had O
an O
unexpected O
surprise O
after O
an O
initial O
disappointment O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
TV O
. O

Save O
yourself O
some O
headaches O
and O
avoid O
this O
one O
. O

Their O
claim O
of O
clarity O
is O
true O
in O
my O
opinion O

Amazing O

this O
6 O

will O
last O

There O
is O
a O
small O

that O
when O

stops O

It O
does O
come O
with O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
VGA O
adapter O

In O
last O
7 O
minths O
I O
have O
tested O
several O
aspects O
of O
this O
router O
and O
no O
wonder O
it O
is O
still O
at O
almost O
same O
price O
and O
a O
top O
- O
seller O
. O

The O
setting O
on O
both O
were O
High O
Performance O
and O
medium O
brightness O

The O
film O
will O
bond O
tightly O
around O
any O
particles O
that O
get O
between O
the O
film O
and O
the O
screen O
, O
making O
them O
less O
of O
an O
annoyance O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
light O

portable O

good O

If O
it O
were O
made O
in O
the O
US O
of O
A O
and O
had O
better O
bass O
it O
would O
be O
a O
5 O

product O
even O
if O
it O
cost O
the O
full O
$ O
50 O

does O
it O
's O
job O
well O
, O
not O
much O
more O
to O
say O
than O
that O
. O

The O
charge O
only O
port O
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
for O
tablet O
owners O
lacking O
a O
charger O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
rather O
have O
another O

I O

would O
protect O

have O
a O
spot O

as O
a O

for O
my O
computer O
to O
allow O
the O
bottom O

it O

breath O

but O
it O
still O
does O

cool O
it O
enough O
, O

come O
on O

The O
connections O
are O
very O
tight O

so O
you O
do O

have O
to O
worry O
about O
them O
coming O
apart O
at O
all O

But O
the O

is O
so O
bad O
that O
this O

is O
worthy O

only O
2 O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
the O

I O
like O
it O
even O
more O

the O

IN O
THE O
PAST O

I'VE O

The O
video O

the O
same O
as O
an O
Ultra O

All O
of O
these O

some O
really O
good O

the O

the O

( O

listed O
on O

Not O
the O
kind O
of O
zipper O
that O
is O
going O
to O
rip O
open O
or O
unzip O
due O
to O
being O
flung O
about O

I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
laptop O
that O
did O
n't O
have O
the O

blowing O
really O
hard O
and O

. O

You O
must O
press O

... O

i O
took O
this O
sucker O
everywhere O
being O
it O
fit O
nicely O
into O
my O
pocket O
. O

I O
used O
it O
for O
my O
Hackintosh O
running O

. O

Finally O
with O
prices O
coming O
down O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
that O
was O
small O
and O
light O
enough O
to O
be O
extremely O
portable O
, O
but O
powerful O
enough O
to O
play O
1080p O
MKV O
files O
without O
hiccups O
. O

However O
, O
the O

is O
a O
fine O
travel O
companion O
, O
and O
I O
can O
do O
everything O
I O
need O
and O
want O
with O
it O
on O
the O
road O
with O
virtually O
no O
compromises O
. O

I O
love O
this O

. O

Near O
that O
large O
clip O
is O
a O
large O

that O
allows O
you O
to O
very O
quickly O
change O
the O

I O
like O
the O

, O
and O
wanted O
a O
matching O
strap O

I O
usually O
do O
n't O
buy O
high O
quality O
laptops O
like O
this O
, O
so O
the O
build O
feels O
very O
nice O
for O
my O
standards O
. O

Given O
the O
limited O
storage O
capacity O
though O
, O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
use O

It O
's O
still O
impressive O
for O
an O

After O
purchasing O
the O
dell O

, O
they O
lied O
about O
having O
a O
working O
digitizer O
until O
this O
pen O
came O
along O
. O

With O
multi O
- O
functions O
for O
less O
than O
15 O
bucks O
, O
this O
mouse O
works O
smoothly O
and O
flawlessly O
. O

Installing O
the O
drive O
was O
quick O
and O
easy O
. O

The O
battery O
also O
completely O
covers O
the O
earphone O
port O
. O

It O
's O
about O
20 O
little O
packets O
of O
plain O
, O
white O
thermal O
grease O
. O

It O
's O
cheaper O
to O
protect O
a O
hard O
drive O
than O
have O
it O
repaired O
or O
recovered O
. O

and O
it O
seemed O
to O
help O
quite O
a O
bit O
- O
dropping O
the O
temp O
to O
an O
average O
of O
51 O

to O
remind O

Bit O
pricey O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
a O
Mac O
, O
you O
are O
n't O
hurting O
that O
badly O
. O

They O
work O
great O
when O
new O

but O
be O
prepared O
for O
smudges O
when O
they O
are O
ready O
for O
the O
wash O

This O
may O
affct O
the O
battery O
life O

Whenever O
music O
or O
lower O
notes O
resonated O
, O
it O
sounded O
like O
the O
trackpad O
itself O
rattled O
in O
place O
. O

I O
picked O
up O
mine O
at O
Costco O
for O
45 O
. O
00 O
, O
but O
I O
got O
the O
last O
one O
and O
would O
have O
no O
problem O
paying O
a O
bit O
more O
for O
another O
. O

I O
was O
leary O
about O
buying O
this O
without O
reviews O
, O
but O
I O
went O
against O
my O
better O
judgement O
and O
bought O
it O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
I O
'm O
being O
anal O
because O
it O
works O
but O
the O
instructions O
seem O
to O
be O
wrong O
, O
or O
because O
it O
worries O
me O
that O
maybe O
something O
is O
just O
wrong O
with O
my O
unit O
and O
it O
will O
go O
blooey O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nowhere O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
as O
I O
type O

While O
it O
has O
plenty O
of O
raw O
space O
for O
things O
like O
chargers O
, O
spare O
batteries O
, O

, O
and O
office O
items O
, O
there O
are O
few O
ways O

effectively O

not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
ejecting O

low O

This O
little O
thing O
has O
a O
great O
sound O

plenty O
to O
overpower O

and O
still O
be O
clear O
enough O
to O
listen O
to O
spoken O

The O

is O
really O
sharp O

the O

small O

light O

is O
smooth O

easy O

does O
what O
you O
want O

terrible O
at O

is O
frankly O

I O
am O
pleased O
to O
recommend O
this O
company O

its O

They O
fold O
up O
nicely O

you O

The O

started O
failing O
after O
2 O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
and O
after O
that O
a O
vertical O
line O
on O

was O
dead O

The O
product O
allows O
for O
simultaneous O
charging O
of O
at O

two O
products O

and O
a O
" O
wall O

in O

If O
I O
never O
use O
it O
one O
of O
my O
grandkids O
someday O
may O
travel O
acrossthe O
pond O
and O
use O
it O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
helps O
. O

No O
problems O
in O
this O
area O
. O

There O
is O
even O
a O
little O
D O
ring O
for O
a O
carabineer O
to O
hang O
the O
case O
up O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
looking O
for O
another O
holder O
for O
my O
memory O
cards O
. O

You O
can O
feel O
how O
protective O
the O
case O
is O
if O
you O
just O
grab O
it O
. O

My O
only O
concern O
is O
whether O
or O
not O
this O
bag O
will O
pass O
as O
a O
carry O
on O
when O
I O
go O
traveling O
by O
air O
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O

There O
is O
still O
room O
left O
over O
in O
the O
top O
for O
other O
items O
, O
and O
the O
back O
panel O
for O
a O
medium O
size O
laptop O
. O

A O
huge O
percentage O
of O
my O
laptop O
/ O
tablet O
use O
is O
for O
web O
browsing O
and O
emailing O
. O

This O
computer O
boots O
up O
from O
completely O
off O
so O
fast O
! O
! O

The O
item O
was O
delivered O
quickly O
, O
packaging O
was O
outstanding O
. O

It O
is O
perfect O
for O
eliminating O
cable O
mess O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
. O

She O
charges O
lapton O

, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Pretty O
amazing O
, O
considering O

Keys O

quietly O
enough O
. O

There O
were O
many O
bugs O
in O
Honeycomb O
, O
and O
even O
more O
in O
ICS O
. O

It O
is O
also O
true O
that O
you O
have O
to O
burn O
your O
own O
recovery O
disks O
for O
Windows O
, O
but O
given O
the O
price O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O

about O
that O

I O
am O
delighted O

Watching O

, O
or O
even O
on O
your O

( O
perhaps O
something O
you O
downloaded O
from O

, O
generates O
quite O
a O

. O

Acer O
allows O

do O

however O
that O

not O

and O
another O

. O

The O
front O
edge O
of O
the O

has O
a O
sharp O

that O
was O
uncomfortable O
to O
my O

The O

be O

there O

those O
who O
ca O
nt O
find O
it O
. O

Good O
value O
shipped O
to O
my O

But O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
true O
when O
people O
say O
that O
there O
's O
no O
ONE O
good O
bag O
for O
everything O
, O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
be O
like O
a O

with O

and O
have O
different O
ones O
for O
different O
occasions O

Nonetheless O
I O
finally O
got O
tired O
of O
sharing O
a O
charger O
with O
someone O
, O
and O
bought O
this O
one O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O

been O
looking O
for O
a O

back O

without O
any O
data O
loss O
thankfully O
and O
it O
's O
working O
just O
as O
well O
as O
it O
did O
before O
! O

The O
Sony O
is O
bulkier O
and O
more O
expensive O

The O
only O
gripe O
is O
that O
extends O
out O
the O
back O
of O
the O
laptop O
about O
3/4&#34 O
; O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
to O
say O
that O
my O
machine O
runs O
ok O
with O
with O
this O
memory O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
augment O
my O
notebook O
when O
I O
have O
space O
for O
a O
mouse O
. O

, O
I O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
revise O
my O
review O
of O
this O
product O
as O
I O
sit O
here O
, O
tortured O
by O
the O
noise O
the O
fan O
is O
making O
right O
now O
. O

All O
of O
this O
, O
plus O
the O
macro O
hardware O
went O
in O
the O
main O
compartment O
. O

Thankfully O
you O
can O
download O
" O
Classic O
Shell O
" O
( O
which O
is O
free O
) O
and O
it O
will O
bring O
back O
a O
start O
button O
and O
some O
of O
the O
function O
at O
the O
very O
least O
. O

Now O
some O
may O
disagree O
, O
but O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
much O
difference O
. O

One O
thing O
about O
MacBooks O
is O
that O
they O
're O
so O
thin O
the O
monitor O
is O
practically O
starting O
at O
the O
level O
of O
your O
desk O
, O
this O
stand O
works O
very O
well O
to O
rectify O
that O
issue O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
lightweight O

The O
spots O
in O
the O
front O
compartment O
for O
folders O
, O
papers O
, O
etc O
. O
are O
great O
for O

favorite O
book O

and O

and O

When O
in O
Windows O
, O
you O
can O
expect O
to O
get O
about O
half O
as O
much O
battery O
power O
as O
in O
ExpressGate O
. O

About O
the O
plastic O
border O
is O
not O
really O
a O
complain O
, O
at O
least O
it O
does O
n't O
reflect O
it O
's O
own O
tv O
light O
as O
others O
reviews O
said O
. O

As O
for O
the O
screen O
, O
it O
is O
supposedly O
HD O
and O
I O
would O
describe O
it O
as O
" O
decent O
, O
" O
it O
is O
simply O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
ultra O
HD O
screen O
you O
will O
get O
on O
a O
$ O
1500 O
laptop O
. O

It O
works O
fine O
and O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

I O
had O
an O
old O
external O

IDE O
enclosure O
but O
my O
3 O
. O
5 O
to O

adapter O
was O
worn O
out O
. O

I O
did O
go O
shopping O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
for O
recently O
and O
noticed O
that O
many O
of O
them O
do O
n't O
offer O
any O
type O
of O
dock O
option O
now O
. O

Bought O
this O

to O
make O
this O

Its O
also O
very O
light O

NOTE O

) O

The O
on O
/ O
off O
button O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
mouse O
is O
an O
interesting O
solution O

Thus O
it O
's O
fairly O
easy O
to O
drag O
something O
past O
the O
line O
and O
lose O
control O
of O
it O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
its O
performance O
and O

The O

so O
let O
me O
delve O
into O
that O
: O

Works O
fantastic O
! O

I O
hope O
the O
people O
who O
made O
this O
product O
would O
create O
a O
more O
expensive O
version O
that O
has:- O
larger O
speakers O
, O
perhaps O
even O
separate O
mid O

bass O
and O
tweeter O
speakers O
that O
can O
handle O
the O
bass.- O
a O
remote O
control O
for O
the O
volume O
and O
mute O
controls.- O
maybe O
even O
separate O
bass O
and O
treble O
controls O
too.- O

The O
reason O
I O

because O

this O

be O
a O

! O

A O
definite O
must O
have O
for O
gaming O
. O

I O
previously O
reviewed O
a O
similar O
product O
from O
BlueRigger O
except O
that O
it O
was O
a O
male O
- O
to O
- O
male O
cord O
. O

its O
been O
thru O
alot O
because O
it O
goes O
in O
my O
back O
pack O
and O
gets O
tossed O
around O
alot O

I O
am O
very O
please O
with O
this O
battery O
and O
would O
buy O
again O

I O
was O
really O
impressed O
that O
I O
could O
get O
50 O
foot O
of O
able O
for O
such O
a O
low O
price O
. O

I O
updated O
the O
firmware O
via O
ethernet O
after O
taking O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
have O
had O
no O
real O
issues O
with O
it O
. O

This O
item O
was O
was O
well O
packaged O
, O
shipped O
and O
received O
promptly O
, O
and O
was O
exactly O
as O
described O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
works O
really O
well O

It O
's O
flexible O
and O
slim O
and O
I O
can O
push O
the O
case O
into O
my O
handbag O
and O
' O
roll O
' O
the O
handles O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
theis O
is O
a O
HP O
issue O
? O
or O
that O
the O
screen O
is O
just O
to O
thick O
... O

That O
means O
I O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
graphics O
card O
. O

Launchpad O
shows O
queued O
up O
downloads O
or O
updates O
to O
existing O
apps O
rather O
than O
the O
app O
itself O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
the O
kit O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
quite O
make O
sense O
as O
the O
bag O
is O
for O
an O
SLR O
camera O
, O
but O
the O
tripod O
is O
really O
too O
small O
for O
an O
SLR O
without O
risk O
of O
it O
tipping O
over O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
button O
to O
connect O
/ O
reconnect O
the O
devices O
, O
which O
has O
come O
in O
hand O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
this O
particular O
AC O
power O
adapter O
that O
I O
got O
has O
gone O
down O
in O
the O
ratings O
since O
the O
time O
that O
I O
got O
mine O
. O

The O
padding O
for O
back O
comfort O
is O
on O
the O
thin O
side O
and O
is O
constructed O
of O
breathable O
material O
. O

Could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

But O
the O
serious O
problem O
is O
something O
I O
've O
just O
noticed O
recently O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
with O
the O
same O
HDD O
. O

So O
much O
for O
Mac O
technical O
support O
. O

PErfect O
for O
my O
nexus O
7 O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
device O
, O
I O
usually O
used O
too O
much O
very O
happy O
, O
thanks O

However O
, O
on O
the O
small O
screen O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
it O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
focusing O
at O
anything O
closer O
than O
a O
1 O
feet O
. O

Other O
reviewers O
have O
said O
in O
effect O
: O

My O
computer O
recognized O
it O
immediately O

Not O
bad O
odds O
. O

so O
it O
could O
be O
a O
very O
minor O
inconvenience O
at O
times O
. O

( O
it O
says O
" O
twice O
as O
long O
" O
on O
the O
packaging).The O
upside O
of O
the O
JumpStart O
battery O
is O
it O
is O
the O
most O
comfortable O
battery O
I O
have O
owned O
. O

But O
it O
does O
add O
an O
inch O
or O
so O
extra O
thickness O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
very O
rugged O
, O
with O
heavy O
duty O
straps O
and O
a O
cable O
- O
reinforced O
top O
handle O
. O

Works O
perfectly O
at O
my O
home O
theater O
for O
my O
components O
that O
need O
a O
direct O
Ethernet O
cable O
( O
xbox O
, O
2 O
dvrs O
and O
the O
TV O
) O
. O

so O
I O
ended O
up O
hot O
gluing O
it O
on O
. O

The O
VX O
Nano O
is O
perfect O
for O
traveling O
. O

All O
metal O
housing O
. O

Silver O
gray O
color O
gives O
it O
a O
very O
sophisticated O

It O
should O
have O
been O
5/5 O
but O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
product O
. O

It O
barely O
meets O
the O
minimum O
for O
Windows O
Vista O

Anyways O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
you O
'll O
notice O
when O
using O
this O
cooler O
in O
your O
lap O
is O
that O
there O
are O
numerous O
sharp O
points O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
cooler O
that O
make O
it O
very O
uncomfortable O
and O
may O
even O
scratch O
you O
if O
not O
careful O
. O

If O
you O
prefer O
a O
larger O
mouse O
, O
try O
the O
VX O
Revoultion O
which O
is O
slightly O
larger O
and O
has O
a O
manual O
switch O
for O
the O
scroll O
wheel O
and O
is O
VERY O
comfortable O
to O
use O
. O

We O
appreciate O
having O
more O
desk O
space O
, O
but O
have O
decided O
to O
keep O
them O
on O
the O
bookshelf O
instead O
of O
mounting O
them O
on O
the O
wall O
. O

Nice O
quality O
; O
no O
issues O
thus O
far O
. O

My O
wife O
liked O
it O
as O
a O
mouse O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
buy O
her O
one O
. O

Nice O
for O
NiMH O
batteries O
that O
discharge O
, O
mostly O
in O
a O
Digital O
Camera O
and O
when O
you O
need O
to O
use O
the O
camera O
, O
the O
batteries O
are O
dead O
. O

My O
son O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
camera O
it O
preforms O
well O
and O
views O
all O
his O
friends O
daily O

Just O
plug O
it O
in O
, O
and O
drag O
/ O
drop O
files O
. O

The O
screen O
arrived O
in O
great O
condition O
, O
sealed O
and O
protected O
. O

The O
lock O
head O
' O
clicks O
' O
onto O
a O
little O
pin O
that O
you O
need O
to O
secure O
into O
the O
Kensington O
slot O
when O
you O
first O
set O
it O
up O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
solution O
if O
you O
need O
to O
get O
data O
off O
an O
old O
laptop O
drive O
that O
does O
not O
work O
any O
longer O
, O
or O
a O
laptop O
that O
does O
not O
work O
any O
longer O

It O
would O
be O
better O
if O
it O
had O
Windows O
special O

The O

Excellent O
price O
for O
a O
cable O
of O
this O
quality O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
buy O
this O
item O
again O

My O
only O
concern O
is O
that O

The O

I O
'm O
getting O
another O
laptop O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
will O
be O
purchasing O
another O
one O
of O
these O
models O
to O
help O
keep O
that O
one O
cooler O
as O
well O
. O

This O
product O
is O
better O
than O
Targus O

The O
car O

works O
as O
advertised O

I O
know O
some O
MP3 O
player O
requires O
convert O
format O
of O

when O
we O
transfer O
into O

No O
support O
for O
Linux O
, O
ARM O
- O

Windows O

, O
or O
other O
OS&#34;.Just O
because O
this O
manufacturer O
ca O
n't O
get O
their O
act O
together O
with O
other O
OS O
's O
is O
NO O
reason O
to O
belittle O
them O
- O
what O
a O
dumb O
and O
ignorant O
statement O
! O

Apple O
claims O
you O
can O
get O
' O
up O
to O
12 O
hours O
' O
of O
battery O
life O
, O
and O
that O
is O
true O
for O
the O
first O
few O
months O
. O

I O
got O
the O
black O
one O

When O
I O
received O
the O
case O
, O
I O
thought O

i O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
cannon O
DSLR O
, O
and O
it O
holds O
the O
lenses O
very O
well O
and O
secure O
. O

If O
less O
than O
one O

was O
available O
for O
this O

it O
would O
receive O

than O
that O
, O
the O
viewing O
angle O
is O
alright O

but O
also O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
Philips O

The O
ability O
to O
switch O
from O
the O
front O
facing O
to O
rear O
facing O
cameras O
is O
very O
cool O
since O
you O
can O
show O
others O
what O
you O
are O
looking O
at O
and O
give O
virtual O
tours O
of O
your O
surroundings O
at O
the O
touch O
of O
a O
button O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
press O
any O
keys O
twice O

Follow O
the O
instructions O
and O
it O
will O
work O

as O

going O
to O

In O
some O
european O
hotels O
you O
use O
the O
keycard O
to O
turn O
power O
on O
in O
the O
room O
but O
some O
rooms O
would O
continue O
to O
power O
the O
devices O
once O
plugged O
in O
( O
I O
did O
n't O
quite O
figure O
that O
out O

It O
never O
bogs O
down O
or O
gets O
slow O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
it O
lacks O
from O
my O
perspective O
is O
an O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O

with O
these O
babies O
. O

I O
truly O
dislike O
loud O
fans O
spinning O
up O
and O
making O
a O
racket O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
I O
dislike O
burning O
my O
lap O
with O

/ O
heater O

keyboard O
is O
well O
made O
if O
not O
better O
than O
stock O

I O
have O
n't O
run O
any O
benchmarks O
( O
yes O
, O
but O
I O
will O
within O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
just O
to O
make O
a O
personal O
comparison O
) O
, O
but O
I O
can O
guarantee O
that O
the O
PC O
Mark O
scores O
will O
be O
higher O
. O

Only O
plug O
your O
device O
into O
the O
battery O
when O
you O
intend O
to O
use O
it O
or O
charge O
it O
. O

You O
will O
need O
your O
own O
software O
package O
( O
such O
as O
Map O
Point O
) O
to O
use O
it O
. O

The O
case O
is O
soft O
with O
a O
few O
millimeters O
of O
foam O
. O

Volume O
is O
adequate O
if O
you O
turn O
it O
way O
up O
( O
85 O
% O
or O
more O
) O

at O
3rd O
month O
, O
I O
heard O
big O
pop O
sound O
and O
the O
power O
supply O
just O
die O
on O
me O
( O
came O
with O
burn O
smell O
) O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
's O
the O
product O
you O
should O
compare O
with O
. O

Whoever O
it O
was O
, O
they O
should O
be O
flogged O
. O

To O
me O
that O
will O
work O
better O
with O
a O
touch O
screen O
not O
with O
a O
standard O
laptop O
screen O
. O

I O
personally O
have O
not O
heard O
or O
checked O
out O
the O
speaker O
but O
my O
brother O
has O
and O
he O
said O
it O
sounds O
amazing O
for O
a O
little O
speaker O
. O

All O
together O
, O
it O
weighed O
in O
at O
15 O
pounds O
, O
but O
the O
padded O
shoulder O
strap O
made O
it O
easy O
to O
carry O
and O
transport O
. O

some O
reviews O
claim O
the O
kn744aa O
will O
not O
work O
with O
the O

dv7z O
laptop O
mine O
is O
about O
15 O
months O
old O
and O
it O
works O
just O
great O

1 O
is O
in O
my O
bedroom O
, O
and O
this O
works O
. O

The O
padding O
on O
the O
strap O
is O
pretty O
useless O
. O

An O
attractive O
, O
but O
quite O
short O
braided O
wrist O
strap O
is O
part O
of O
the O
package O
, O
but O
the O
loop O

circumference O
is O
only O
nine O
inches O
. O

After O
contacting O
Samsung O
, O
I O
was O
referred O
toTracfone O

I O
have O
bought O
another O

apple O

for O
my O

works O
fine O

If O
you O
're O
like O
me O
and O
decide O
to O
sell O
your O
1 O
or O
2 O
year O
old O
computer O
to O
buy O
the O
newest O
, O
latest O
, O
and O
greatest O
, O
it O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
sell O
if O
the O
buyer O
knows O
that O
they O
will O
get O
a O
year O
or O
two O
of O
warranty O
and O
tech O
support O
for O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
bag O
, O
very O
well O
made O
. O

The O
additional O
haptic O
pen O
is O
also O
nice O
. O

Once O
installed O
, O
the O
computer O
quickly O
identified O
the O
Bluetooth O
2 O
. O
1 O
headset O
and O
Bluetooth O
2 O
. O

So O
basically O
, O
if O
you O
just O
want O
something O
to O
make O
typing O
easier O
on O
your O
tablet O
or O
if O
you O
're O
too O
lazy O
to O
sit O
in O
front O
of O
your O
computer O
/ O
laptop O
/ O
etc O
, O
this O
is O
good O
enough O
. O

No O
heating O
problem O
when O
not O
in O
use O
. O

I O
worry O
that O
these O
will O
break O
or O
crack O
with O
age O
. O

Came O
on O
specified O
date O
and O
time O
by O
CEVA O
. O

I O
strongly O
suggest O
using O
a O
high O
quality O
screwdriver O
to O
avoid O
stripping O
out O
the O
tiny O
phillips O
screws O
on O
the O
cover O
and O
battery O
mounts O
. O

The O
trackpad O
is O
smooth O
, O
large O
, O
and O
super O
responsive O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
it O
will O
work O

It O
looks O
cool O
sitting O
on O
your O
desk O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
Haswell O
Chromebook O
was O
announced O
I O
ordered O
it O
because O
the O
ARM O
chip O
in O
Chromebook O
sucks O
. O

I O
actually O
bought O
90w O
HP O
charger O
after O
that O
( O
though O
I O
was O
very O
happy O
with O
Anker O
, O
since O
I O
needed O
one O
more O
charger O
, O
I O
thought O
to O
by O
from O
the O
computer O
's O
manufacturer O
) O
. O

I O
had O
a O
presentation O
due O
and O
just O
had O
to O
log O
into O
my O
Google O
account O
and O
pull O
it O
up O
on O
the O
school O
computer O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
take O
some O
drivers O
or O
updating O
or O
SOMETHING O

Therefore O
, O
my O
results O
may O
not O
be O
duplicated O
with O
slower O
internet O
pipes O
. O

I O
really O
feel O
like O
Imprisoned O
, O
limited O
and O
right O
now O
, O
I O
have O
trouble O
breathing O
! O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
better O
words O
for O
the O
RAM O

However O
, O
this O
changed O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
get O
online O
on O
Aug O
, O
16 O
, O
roughly O
six O
weeks O
after O
my O
purchase O
. O

They O
fit O
like O
the O
case O
was O
made O
for O
them O
. O

It O
collects O
dust O
as O
we O
speak O
. O

Item O
was O
as O
described O
, O
and O
came O
in O
a O
timely O
manner O
. O

have O
3 O
of O
them O
so O
I O
can O
set O
my O
xoom O
down O
and O
charge O
and O
listen O
to O
a O
little O
better O
quality O
sound O
love O
it O
for O
what O
it O
is O

I O
hope O
it O
lasts O
longer O
than O
the O
Lenovo O
part O
. O

Finally O
heard O
back O

I O
guess O
I O
should O
mention O
set O
up O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
3 O
days O
, O
and O
the O
red O
X O
is O
gone O
from O
my O
compuetr O
( O
boy O
, O
that O
was O
annoying O
) O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
doing O
its O
job O
. O

Since O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
and O
sounds O
so O
good O
, O
I O
've O
taken O
to O
moving O
the O
speakers O
to O
wherever O
I O
am O
in O
the O
house O
instead O
of O
having O
the O
home O
PC O
play O
through O
the O
home O
speakers O
throughout O
the O
whole O
house O
. O

You O
'll O
probably O
not O
find O
better O
for O
the O
money O
. O

nice O
cable O
kit O
for O
hooking O
up O
my O
dvd O
burner O
from O
my O
old O
desktop O
pc O
to O
my O
new O
laptop O
pc O
. O

The O
packaging O
was O
impressive O
as O
i O
was O
expecting O
a O
$ O
2 O
cable O
to O
be O
bot O
so O
good O
of O
a O
quality O
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
it O
has O
far O
greater O
capacity O
. O

Even O
if O
they O
're O
not O
permanently O
damaged O
, O
they O
require O
constant O
polishing O
to O
maintain O
that O
satin O
luster O
. O

With O
a O
few O
refinements O
in O
the O
future O
, O
I O
think O
this O
will O
be O
a O
near O
perfect O
all O
- O
purpose O
device O
that O
is O
awfully O
close O
right O
now O
! O

Guess O
if O
I O
run O
Windows O
98 O

This O
speaker O
system O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
! O

I O
would O
have O
given O
it O
4 O
or O
5 O
stars O

The O
laptop O
with O
shell O
on O
gets O
a O
better O
fit O
inside O
the O
sleeve O
. O

I O
consider O
this O
is O
a O
large O
version O
of O
UMPC O
. O

I O
did O
not O
spend O
the O
much O
more O
money O
for O
the O
surface O

I O
bought O
this O
little O
Bluetooth O
USB O

Please O
take O
into O
account O
this O
hub O
's O
extremely O
low O
price O
: O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
order O
a O
couple O
more O
of O
them O
and O
even O
if O
one O
( O
or O
more O
) O
lasts O
only O
a O
year O
or O
two O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
feel O
that O
I O
've O
been O
" O
taken."Please O
note O
again O
that O
I O
am O
not O
using O
this O
hub O
with O
a O
computer O
; O
I O
am O
using O
it O
with O
an O
Oppo O

I O
love O
shopping O
at O
Amazon O
because O
of O
the O
quality O
and O
great O
customer O
service O
. O

Here O
's O
one O
where O
they O
all O
fail O
: O
the O
compartments O
are O
all O
in O
the O
front O
- O
causing O
the O
bags O
to O
tip O
easier O
and O
right O
onto O
the O
laptop O
, O
thereby O
shattering O
the O
screen O
. O

Hopefully O
will O
order O
from O
this O
company O
again O
. O

This O
pack O
fit O
like O
a O
glove O
and O
worked O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

It O
's O
neat O
that O
they O
included O
a O
tiny O
screwdriver O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
small O
philips O
head O
with O
a O
magnetized O
tip O
, O
I O
recommend O
you O
use O
that O
instead O
, O
as O
YOU O
WILL O
drop O
or O
lose O
the O
screws O
using O
the O
included O
screwdriver O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
product O
. O

They O
worked O
great O
for O
their O
size O
however O
. O

I O
am O
certain O
that O
powering O
normal O
USB O
devices O
with O
this O
adapter O
and O
the O
other O
hub O
would O
never O
even O
hiccup O
. O

My O
son O
purchased O
one O
of O
these O

It O
far O
surpases O
the O
working O
time O
I O
was O
expecting O
when O
I O
ordered O
.. O

I O
charged O
it O
overnight O
again O
. O

Took O
no O
more O
than O
3 O
days O
, O
too O
! O

AAA's).I'm O
very O
picky O
about O
my O
hardware O

seems O
good O
. O

fine O
so O
far O
. O

You O
can O
not O
beat O
the O
price O
this O
computer O
is O
sold O
on O
Amazon O
and O
you O
will O
not O
get O
these O
specs O
& O
the O
quality O
from O
any O
other O
notebook O
in O
this O
price O
range O

like O
about O
this O
product O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
it O
does O
not O
provide O
enough O
power O
to O
interact O
with O
your O
iPod O
. O

What O
does O
it O
mean O
that O
these O
tiny O
cables O
do O
their O
job O
well O
( O
after O
all O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
very O
difficult O
job O
to O
do O
) O
? O

I O
purchased O
this O
charger O
so O
I O
can O
take O
with O
me O
when O
I O
leave O
my O
house O
and O
use O
my O
main O
one O
at O
my O
home O
. O

The O
housing O
of O
this O
flash O
drive O
extends O
out O
at O
an O
angle O
where O
the O
male O
usb O
port O
come O
out O
, O
not O
allowing O
for O
full O
incursion O
of O
the O
usb O
port O
into O
the O
computer O
. O

People O
with O
little O
hands O
might O
not O
like O
it O
though O
it O
is O
bigger O
then O
most O
mice O
. O

6000mAh O
may O
sound O
like O
a O
lot O

Setting O
up O
wireless O
internet O
connection O
was O
very O
easy O
. O

There O
have O
no O
issues O
since O
using O
this O
for O
over O
a O
month O
nowR O
Elliott O

While O
this O
is O
easily O
rectified O
with O
a O
bluetooth O
dongle O
, O
it O
's O
just O
unusual O
to O
see O
a O
laptop O
without O
it O
, O
but O
if O
that O
's O
what O
contributes O
to O
the O
price O
point O
of O
this O
laptop O
, O
that O
's O
perfectly O
acceptable O
to O
me O
. O

This O
is O
an O
extremely O
satisfying O
plug O
and O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
the O
business O
or O
any O
other O
traveler O
! O

Nice O
to O
have O
a O
little O
on O
- O
off O
switch O
on O
the O
card O
for O
the O
WiFi O
. O

The O
system O
comes O
with O
4 O
different O
cable O
connections O
and O
there O
are O
no O
instructions O
as O
to O
which O
one O
plugs O
into O
which O
port O
. O

Let O
me O
try O
the O
generic O
adapter O
with O
NO O
antenna O
, O
-75 O
RSSI O
. O

Only O
thing O
I O
would O
recommend O
is O
not O
to O
keep O
it O
anywhere O
it O
could O
take O
a O
fall O
because O
it O
does O
move O
when O
you O
're O
listening O
to O
music O
. O

The O
battery O
lasted O
longer O
than O
the O
computer O
did O
. O

The O
adapter O
was O
unable O
to O
discover O
some O
headphones O
that O
I O
had O
purchased O
for O
this O
, O
but O
eventually O
, O
after O
reading O
a O
little O
bit O
closer O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
actual O
problem O
was O
they O
were O
not O
being O
properly O
discovered O
. O

Plug O
and O
Play O
on O

, O
super O
easy O
to O

more O
than O
usual O
! O

I O
use O
with O
a O
FAVI O
Bluetooth O
keyboard O
. O

It O
boosted O
my O
signal O
3X O

The O
keys O
very O
often O
are O
duplicated O
on O
the O

and O
the O

is O
very O
hard O
to O

and O
after O
4 O
months O
broke O
off O
and O
the O
seller O
will O
not O
return O
my O
emails O
regarding O
this O
failure O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
buy O
this O
brand O
again O
the O
next O
time O
I O
need O
a O
replacement O
battery O
for O
one O
of O
my O
notebook O
PCs O
. O

The O
honeymoon O
did O
end O
soon O
after O
buying O
it O
last O
year O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
custom O
version O
of O
a O
mini O
- O
DIN O
9-pin O
connector O
, O
which O
is O
something O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
find O
an O
extension O
cable O
for O
. O

So O
, O
for O
what O
it O
's O
worth O
, O
it O
does O
work O
on O
Windows O
8 O
x64 O
( O
at O
least O
after O
a O
couple O
installations O
) O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
delighted O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

I O
mainly O
use O
it O
with O
my O
iPad O
2 O
to O
take O
notes O
during O
meetings O
at O
work O
. O

I O
found O
if O
the O
room O
is O
quiet O
it O
helps O
some O
but O
not O
much O
. O

Hey O
reviewer O
, O
do O
n't O
blame O
the O
tool O
when O
it O
's O
the O
tool O
holders O
fault O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
as O
a O
replacement O
cord O
for O
an O
old O
laser O
printer O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
completely O
locks O
up O
on O
some O
older O
AVI O
video O
CODECs O
like O
Intel O
Indeo O
, O
or O
the O
oddly O
coded O
FLV O
file O
when O
you O
try O
and O
seek O
. O

It O
has O
4 O
USB O
ports O
, O
which O
is O
about O
three O
more O
than O
I O
need O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
and O
my O
legs O
do O
n't O
even O
get O
warm O
. O

That O
is O
, O
with O
a O
laptop O
plus O
my O
camera O
equipment O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
10 O
year O
old O
daughter O
, O
who O
distroyed O
two O
previous O
cooling O
fan O
based O
pads O
by O
pulling O
their O
USB O
cables O
. O

and O
the O
Sharx O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
bigger O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
, O
meaning O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
has O
room O
to O
move O
around O
some O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
will O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
wait O
for O
this O
item O
to O
come O
in O
the O
mail O
to O
find O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
even O
work O
at O
all O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
are O
a O
user O
that O
rests O
your O
wrists O
on O
the O
notebook O
while O
typing O
instead O
of O
letting O
them O
float O
above O
the O
keypad O
, O
you O
will O
get O
many O
creases O
on O
your O
wrists O
and O
will O
likely O
feel O
some O
irritation O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
balance O
between O
carrying O
ability O
and O
size O
. O

the O
8 O
gb O
of O
RAM O
supports O
it O
. O

You O
may O
be O
OK O
with O
this O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
work O
for O
me O
. O

Definitley O

SATISFACTORY O
ITEM O
DELIVERED O
AS O
DESCRIBED O
. O

Two O
negatives O
are O
: O

Looks O
like O
the O
only O
option O
now O
is O
the O
expensive O
Logitech O
dinovo O
mini O
. O

I O
have O
had O
JBL O
speakers O
for O
years O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
think O
a O
device O
of O
this O
size O
could O
deliver O
quality O
sound O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
clear O
keyboard O
cover O
from O
ipearl O
as O
well O
and O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
that O
item O
as O
well O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
my O
work O
laptop O
( O
a O
dell O
precision O
m4600 O
, O
8 O
mb O
ram O
, O
i7 O
processor O
, O
nor O
sure O
about O
video O
card O
) O
to O
play O
SWTOR O
and O
counterstrike O
: O
source O
and O
it O
was O
able O
to O
play O
on O
the O
highest O
settings O
but O
this O
thing O
blows O
it O
away O
. O

However O
, O
once O
it O
's O
a O
little O
stretched O
out O
( O
must O
be O
intentional O
, O
it O
's O
too O
thick O
and O
would O
just O
come O
unplugged O
or O
damage O
a O
connector O
before O
it O
would O
stretch O
with O
a O
device O
plugged O
in O
) O

Pushing O
the O
tiny O
" O
x O
" O
button O
on O
a O
Chrome O
browser O
tab O
is O
actually O
pretty O
easy O
and O
you O
get O
more O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
would O
have O
given O
this O
a O
5 O
star O

It O
has O
the O
quality O
feel O
you O
would O
expect O
for O
a O
notebook O
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

It O
works O
perfect O
for O
that O

There O
's O
nothing O
left O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
my O
case O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
treble O
, O
bass O
, O
or O
any O
other O
elements O
of O
the O
audio O
produced O
by O
Logitech O
's O
clever O
little O
( O
laptop O
) O
speaker O
! O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
see O
a O
difference O
from O
my O
older O
backpack O
that O
did O
n't O
have O
these O
pads O
. O

I O
never O
though O
a O
stand O
would O
impress O
me O

Downside O
, O
is O
a O
very O
average O
shoulder O
strap O
with O
no O
pad O
, O
so O
I O
switched O
out O
with O
old O
computer O
bag O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
look O
on O
line O
and O
see O
if O
they O
make O
replacements O
for O
keyboards O
, O
and O
I O
found O
a O
variety O
of O
prices O
. O

; O
drive O
that O
will O
work O
across O
a O
vast O
variety O
of O
hardware O
and O
across O
Windows O
, O
OSX O
and O
Linux O
based O
systems O
. O

I O
'll O
still O
keep O
the O
cable O
. O

Luckily O
, O
I O
also O
had O
one O
of O
those O
laying O
around O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
OEM O
battery O
and O
has O
the O
same O
life O
& O
endurance O
. O

I O
know O
if O
you O
go O
with O
cheap O
cables O
it O
can O
damage O
your O
device O
and/or O
battery O
life O
. O

Replaced O
a O
faulty O
cord O
( O
manufacturer O
's O
) O
and O
this O
was O
perfect O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
spend O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
to O
replace O
. O

I O
've O
noted O
the O
pros O
/ O
cons O
below O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
cable O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
the O
microUSB O
end O
of O
it O
is O
completely O
bent O
and O
crushed O
. O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
it O
to O
be O
more O
substantial O
. O

I O
'm O
calling O
it O
" O
that O
new O
shoe O
" O
smell O
-- O
it O
really O
does O
smell O
like O
brand O
new O
shoes O
, O
but O
much O
worse O
that O
one O
feels O
compelled O
to O
do O
something O
about O
it O
( O
air O
it O
out O
or O
wash O
it O
) O
. O

Restart O
your O
computer O
. O

Got O
an O
RMA O
and O
sent O
it O
in O
. O

Setup O
took O
all O
of O
5 O
minutes O
and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
champ O
and O
would O
recommend O
highly O
to O
anyone O
trying O
to O
solve O
the O
same O
issue O
I O
had O
.. O

However O
, O
disregard O
any O
mention O
of O
sound O
, O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
no O
sound O
. O

Works O
for O
iPhone O
, O
Shure O
, O
and O
Jlab O
. O

If O
I O
have O
one O
negative O
comment O
( O
and O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
investigation O
this O
may O
not O
be O
possible O
and O
still O
protect O
the O
machine O
) O
is O
that O
the O
cover O
limits O
the O
obtuse O
angle O
of O
being O
able O
to O
open O
the O
cover O
. O

6 O
' O
and O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
in O
this O
bag O
. O

If O
you O
wedge O
the O
wrong O
adapter O
into O
the O
wrong O
socket O
, O
you O
'll O
damage O
one O
or O
both O
. O

Construction O
is O
as O
cheap O
as O
it O
gets O

The O

is O

better O
than O
most O

I O
found O
in O
Best O
buy O

Target O
. O

They O
replaced O
it O
no O
problem O
, O
just O
had O
to O
return O
the O
old O
one O
and O
3 O
days O
after O
they O
received O
it O

I O
prefer O
to O
tap O

with O
a O

rather O
than O
my O

But O
the O
problem O
here O
is O
that O
this O
FRV26 O
has O
no O
Wireless O

, O
which O
is O
becoming O
so O
important O
these O

The O

enough O
to O

If O

you O
have O
the O

to O

away O
, O

The O
only O
issue O
I O
had O
with O
this O
case O
was O
with O
the O
two O
rubbery O
feet O
at O
the O
front O
of O
the O
case O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
big O
time O
picky O
about O
sound O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
my O
music O
. O

The O
Case O
Logic O

is O
not O
bad O
. O

On O
a O
positive O
note O
, O
it O
works O
awesome O
! O

What O
a O
great O
decision O
this O
has O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
. O

If O
you O
need O
a O
low O
price O
webcam O
for O
your O
computer O
or O
laptop O
then O
this O
is O
great O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
did O
not O
have O
luck O
using O
port O
multiplying O
( O
hosting O
an O
enclosure O
with O
multiple O
hard O
drives O
and O
a O
single O
USB O
3 O
connection.- O

Having O
owned O
an O
IBM O
, O
this O
is O
completely O
absurd O
, O
since O
IBM O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
get O
parts O
next O
day O
. O

I O
watch O
Netflix O
daily O
and O
listen O
to O
Pandora O
, O
do O
Bible O
study O
, O
ebay O
, O
and O
lots O
of O
web O
searches O
daily O
and O
this O
thing O
runs O
9 O
or O
10 O
hours O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

It O
took O
four O
weeks O
. O

The O
old O
adapter O
was O
19v O
, O
3 O
. O
95a O
and O
had O
a O
75 O
watt O
rating O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I O
have O
two O
different O
sets O
of O

The O
construction O
of O
the O
bag O
is O
excellent O
. O

I O
was O
suspicious O
about O
how O
cheap O
it O
was O
, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
like O
the O
one O
you O
got O
out O
of O
the O

Not O
much O

I O
could O
have O
used O
a O
cheaper O
unit O
but O
the O
reviews O
out O
there O
for O
this O
one O
are O
fantastic O
. O

I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
anxiety O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
if O
this O
battery O
works O
in O
that O
computer O
. O

I O
use O
it O
strictly O
for O
backups O
so O
dependability O
of O
connection O
is O
just O
as O
important O
as O
speed O
. O

Does O
it O
sound O
better O
than O
a O
5 O

? O

The O
Sony O
's O
are O
good O
, O
but O
overpriced O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
also O
very O
light O
and O
though O
it O
has O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
that O
" O
plastic O
" O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
rather O
beautiful O
machine O
. O

too O

Loved O
my O
new O

Great O
price O
. O

It O
work O
exactly O
as O
I O
would O
expect O
it O
to O
, O
was O
shipped O
promptly O
and O
arrived O
when O
I O
was O
told O
it O
would O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
its O
just O
because O
the O
case O
is O
clear O
, O
but O
it O
scratches O
very O
easily O
. O

, O
you O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
know O
that O
this O
bag O
will O
work O
for O
you O
, O
but O
only O
because O
the O
sides O
are O
soft O
- O
padded O
( O
not O
rigid O
) O

I O
did O
a O
quick O
search O
on O
amazon O
, O
and O
I O
found O
this O
wonderful O
product O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
this O
one O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
out O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

This O
has O
been O
the O
most O
stable O
of O
all O
of O
those O
I O
have O
used O
. O

Scroll O

I O
know O
I O
may O
be O
nit O
picking O
here O
, O
but O
I O
am O
putting O
it O
out O
there O
for O
those O
that O
need O
to O
know O
these O
things O
. O

It O

While O
I O
like O
the O
clearance O
the O
feet O
give O
me O
, O
there O
is O
no O
grips O
. O

( O
Yes O
! O
) O
and O

I O
am O
in O
the O
process O
of O
archiving O
every O
one O
of O
my O
Blu O

rays O
and O
DVDs O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
and O
will O
update O
on O
how O
it O
held O
up O
once O
I O
am O
back O
from O
my O
vacation O
later O
in O
the O
month O
. O

( O
This O
bag O
zips O
and O
is O
certainly O
water O
resistent.)--When O
waiting O
for O
airport O
security O

I O
bought O
this O
computer O
partly O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
IQ804 O
and O
IQ816 O
are O
both O
25 O
inch O
screen O
and O
is O
1920 O
x O
1200 O
. O

Honestly O
I O
suspect O
this O
is O
one O
of O
those O
cases O
where O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I O
like O
that O
as O
it O
's O
very O
easy O
and O
uncomplicated O
. O

I O
not O
use O
, O
or O
handle O
, O
the O
devices O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
charge O
to O
try O
and O
avoid O
damaging O
the O
cables O
. O

Live O
! O
external O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
mind O
of O
its O
own O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
wants O
to O
play O
through O
all O
four O
satellite O
speakers O
. O

I O
keep O
one O
of O
these O
cloths O
by O
my O
iMac O
24 O
" O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

These O
speakers O
are O
better O
than O
the O
built O
- O
in O
speakers O
, O
but O
they O
are O
n't O
perfect O
. O

is O
more O
than O
enough O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
fantastic O
: O
I O
can O
take O
class O
notes O
for O
3 O
hours O
straight O
and O
still O
have O
plenty O
of O
juice O
for O
another O
hour O
or O
two O
of O
use O
... O
if O
I O
had O
to O
estimate O
battery O
time O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
consistently O
gives O
me O
4 O
1/2 O
to O
5 O
hours O
of O
use O
. O

As O
a O
little O
bonus O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
cleaning O
cloth O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
an O
additional O
2 O
weeks O
for O
mine O
because O
they O
initially O
lost O
the O
package O
after O
it O
had O
arrived O
over O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half O
earlier O
. O

If O
you O
are O
interested O
in O
connecting O
this O

a O
Skytex O

Alpha O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
automatically O
work O
. O

so O
I O
just O
need O
a O
converter O
for O
that O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
force O
you O
to O
use O
their O
cheap O
garbage O
software O
, O
beware O
any O
company O
that O
tries O
to O
force O
you O
to O
use O
software O
for O
something O
as O
basic O
as O
connecting O
to O
home O

You O
do O
n't O
need O

you O

Being O

I O
need O
not O
mention O
about O

. O

I O
have O
2 O
and O
they O
work O
great O
. O

Speakers O
are O
better O
than O
average O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

I O
have O
a O
an O
HP O
DV6500 O
Entertainment O
laptop O
and O
this O
is O
not O
a O
product O
that O
works O
with O
its O
power O
/ O
charging O
port O
. O

I O
use O
OneNote O
for O
my O
lectures O
. O

It O
is O
soft O
and O
offers O
good O
protection O
. O

I O
want O
it O
to O
be O
as O
average O
looking O
and O
unobtrusive O
as O
possible O
. O

Seems O
fair O
. O

The O
speakers O
come O
w O
/ O
the O
usb O
cord O
, O
so O
you O
plug O
that O
into O
the O
adaptor O
& O
then O
into O
the O
wall O
electric O
outlet O
. O

You O
'll O
have O
spent O
$ O
500 O
total O
and O
will O
be O
laughing O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
bank O
. O

which O
is O
just O
over O
the O
USB O
standard O
of O
500mA O
, O
and O
I O
found O
that O
2 O
of O
my O
laptops O
and O
one O
desktop O
both O
went O
fine O
with O
just O
the O
data O
/ O
power O
plug O
used O
. O

I O
made O
some O
adjustments O
by O
trying O
to O
put O
the O
heaviest O
lenses O
towards O
the O
bottom O
, O
I O
'm O
guessing O
that O
because O
there O
is O
no O
solid O
bottom O
( O
base O
) O

With O
everything O
else O
being O
such O
good O

have O
a O
new O
work O
laptop O
windows O

but O

It O
's O
getting O
frustrating O
now O
. O

My O
argument O
was O
that O
the O
11 O
inch O
, O
thou O
the O
smallest O
, O
lack O
optic O
and O
mass O
media O
( O
SD O
Card O
reader O
) O
. O

I O
have O
a O
USB O
cooling O
stand O
, O
so O
my O
battery O
life O
is O
going O
to O
be O
shorter O
, O
but O
I O
find O
the O
9 O
cell O
reports O
> O
2 O
. O
5 O
hrs O
available O
when O
switched O
to O
battery O
( O
using O
the O
Notebook O
Hardware O
Control O
app O
) O
. O

It O
was O
probably O
unrealistic O
of O
me O
to O
think O
that O
I O
could O
find O
ANY O
one O
bag O
that O
would O
give O
me O
what O
I O
dream O
of O
- O
a O

This O
Mac O
is O
fast O
( O
but O
this O
is O
relative O
) O
and O
I O
like O
the O
response O
from O
the O
keys O
when O
I O
press O
them O
. O

I O
liked O
it O
, O
but O
I O
was O
annoyed O
that O
the O
case O
blocked O
the O
power O
port O
in O
a O
weird O
way O
. O

For O
that O
I O
need O
an O
external O
keyboard O
and O
an O
elevated O
iPad O
stand O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
discuss O
this O
too O
much O
for O
this O
review O
, O
but O
I O
am O
already O
considering O
installing O
windows O
7 O
, O
and O
would O
have O
already O
done O
so O
if O
not O
for O
the O
touch O
screen O
. O

The O
volume O
wheel O
is O
nice O
and O
smooth O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
mention O
is O
that O
I O
'm O
impressed O
with O
Plugable O

great O

. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
problems O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
thick O
enough O
for O
great O
signal O
strength O
and O
insulation O
, O
gold O
- O
plated O
contacts O
( O
friends O
, O
ALWAYS O
look O
for O
gold O
plated O
contacts O
as O
gold O
conducts O
electricity O
better O
than O
even O
copper O
and O
does O
not O
oxidize O
as O
much O
) O
which O
is O
always O
a O
sign O
of O
a O
better O
quality O
cable O
. O

Touchpad O
is O
quite O
nice O
, O
offering O
an O
easy O
two O

finger O
drag O
down O
its O
middle O
to O
move O
pages O
up O
or O
down O

was O
wrapped O
in O

. O

This O
went O
on O
for O
awhile O
before O
I O
just O
gave O
up O
. O

do O
not O
think O
two O
times O
, O
get O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

very O
cheap O
and O
good O
quality O
, O
good O
purchase O
, O
very O
good O
upgrade O
. O

Came O
with O
a O
79 O
% O

I O
was O
getting O

Exactly O
what O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
, O
do O
nt O
hesitate O
or O
spend O
more O
money O
than O
you O
have O
to O
for O
a O
simple O
splitter O

I O
can O
comfortably O
zip O
the O
sleeve O
close O
and O
there O
's O
about O
1/2 O
inch O
of O
space O
on O
top O
. O

I O
love O
the O
ultra O
bright O
, O
Chernoybl O
blue O
LED O
that O
shows O
the O
unit O
is O
powered O
. O

The O
reason O
why O
I O
only O
gave O
it O
2 O
stars O
is O
that O
the O
plastic O
covering O
the O
wires O
has O
stared O
to O
pull O
away O
from O
the O
charger O
exposing O
wires O
. O

The O
inside O
, O
it O
is O
cushioned O
to O
protect O
the O
macbook O
perfectly O
and O
firmly O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
the O
zipper O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
export O
files O
to O
the O
PC O
but O
the O
software O
just O
locked O
up O
every O
time O
I O
tried O
to O
do O
anything O
with O
them O
. O

The O
mouse O
tracking O
is O
accurate O
with O
no O
noticeable O
latency O
. O

With O
the O
touchscreen O
it O
has O
the O
& O
# O
34;hands O
on&#34 O
; O
feeling O
of O
a O
tablet O
where O
I O
can O
expand O
windows O
or O
text O
using O
my O
fingers O
or O
touching O
the O
spot O
where O
I O
want O
the O
cursor O
to O
go O
, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
big O
, O
beautiful O
15 O
. O
6 O
inch O
screen O
and O
lots O
more O
processing O
power O
and O
memory O
than O
a O
tablet O
or O
smartphone O
. O

The O
keyboard O
cover O
also O
works O
well O
and O
fits O
the O
keys O
although O
with O
the O
keyboard O
lit O
up O

do O
the O
job O
, O
I O
use O
it O
to O
connect O
my O
notebook O
to O
monitor O
, O
works O
well O
, O
nothing O
especial O
just O
a O
HDMI O
to O
DVI O
cable O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
. O

but O
as O
far O
as O
working O
goes O
, O
it O
has O
n't O
failed O
me O
yet O
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
scared O
the O
product O
could O
have O
been O
crushed O
in O
the O
casing O
, O
but O
that O
was O
not O
the O
case O
when O
I O
opened O
it O
. O

It O
's O
enough O
to O
be O
noticeable O
when O
your O
wrists O
rest O
against O
the O
laptop O
. O

If O
you O
need O
a O
replacement O
adapter O
for O
an O
older O
Inspiron O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
choice O
and O
the O
price O
is O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
pay O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
premium O
for O
that O
kind O
of O
quality O
? O

The O
lid O
/ O
screen O
is O
slightly O
warped O
, O
this O
is O
more O
cosmetic O
. O

Perfect O
fit O
replacement O
, O
raises O
pc O
up O
as O
battery O
sticks O
out O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
for O
remote O
workers O
. O

A+ O
on O
build O
and O
sound O
but O
only O
B+ O
on O
performance O
due O
to O
the O
bass O
output O
. O

Amazon O
is O
definitely O
cheaper O
than O
any O
store O
I O
found O
so O
buy O
it O
here O
though O
. O

The O
other O
is O
used O
by O
my O
niece O
. O

Only O
two O
weeks O
into O
the O
tablet O
experience O

However O
, O
if O
you O
have O
internet O
access O
thru O
your O
cell O
, O
or O
you O
have O
a O
wifi O
, O
pocket O
pc O
. O

Puts O
the O
sound O
where O
needed O
not O
all O
over O
the O
room O
. O

It O
has O
the O
look O
and O
feel O
of O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
except O
the O
keys O
are O
not O
backlit O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
needs O
a O
replacement O
battery O
. O

We O
got O
it O
to O
work O
on O
one O
PC O
in O
the O
office O
only O
. O

I O
was O
clearly O
wrong O
to O
think O
that O
because O
it O
is O
a O
perfect O
fit O
and O
it O
easily O
out O
preforms O
my O
low O
quality O
HP O
battery O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
battery O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
either O
because O
the O
Mini O
looks O
good O
on O
the O
wall O
or O
because O
the O
pill O
has O
n't O
worn O
off O
yet O
. O

Wire O
is O
cheap O
, O
so O
6 O
' O
should O
be O
SOP O
. O

For O
those O
that O
have O
G O
you O
are O
better O
off O
focusing O
on O
a O
cheaper O
G O
based O
solution O
or O
upgrading O
to O
N O
completely O
as O
the O
backwards O
compatibility O
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
. O

4 O
oz O
, O
my O
faithful O
travel O
scale O
found O
the O
bag O
without O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
to O
be O
a O
little O
over O
2 O
. O

The O
folio O
provides O
different O
viewing O
angles O
and O
you O
can O
hook O
it O
onto O
one O
of O
the O
ridges O
to O
provide O
a O
stand O
. O

She O
has O
a O
Nexus O
10 O
, O
and O
sometimes O
likes O
to O
chat O
, O
so O
she O
wanted O
to O
use O
this O
with O
her O
keyboard O
. O

This O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
behind O
to O
use O
, O
you O
have O
to O
practically O
look O
under O
there O
to O
see O
what O
you O
are O
doing O
. O

Having O
always O
had O
multiple O
sets O
of O
keys O
for O
my O
other O
cars O
, O
which O
were O
less O
than O
$ O
10/set O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O
with O
just O
one O
way O
too O
expensive O
key O
to O
lose O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
cover O
/ O
sleeve O
. O

I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
this O
product O
until O
I O
was O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
my O
battery O
was O
low O
and O
I O
really O
needed O
to O
stay O
connected O
. O

It O
have O
very O
nice O
color O
balance O
for O
so O
many O
small O
projects O
without O
delete O
them O
and O
save O
these O
files O
forever O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

I O
simply O
love O
it O
and O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

( O
That O
's O
probably O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
Nexus O
or O
the O
file O
. O
) O

What O
I O
like O
about O
it O
, O
The O
battery O
last O
about O
3 O
. O
6 O
hours O
for O
using O
with O
out O
the O
power O
cord O
. O

There O
is O
considerably O
more O
Velcro O
on O
it O
than O
on O
the O
version O
" O
A O
" O
strap O
-- O
many O
more O
inches O
-- O
but O
this O
does O
n't O
hold O
my O
13 O
" O
computer O
more O
securely O
, O
because O
the O
Velcro O
is O
n't O
positioned O
as O
well O
as O
it O
could O
be O
. O

Two O
things O
that O
could O
be O
improved O
. O

Battery O
life O
- O
I O
have O
owned O
mine O
for O
almost O
2 O
years O
and O
just O
changed O
the O
battery O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

It O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
charge O
and O
iPhone O
, O
but O
can O
not O
seem O
to O
charge O
an O
iPad O
. O

it O
actually O
hurt O
my O
back O
using O
it O
on O
a O
long O
3 O
leg O
international O
flight O
. O

If O
you O
run O
out O

TIVO O
SUGGESTIONS O

feature O
which O
records O

it O
thinks O
you O
will O
like O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
DivX O
videos O
on O
an O
8 O

card O
! O

Top O
quality O
! O

We O
are O
pretty O
darn O
happy O
about O
this O
product O
! O

Freedom O
to O
move O
around O
. O

If O
your O
going O
to O
use O
in O
different O
environments O
though O
I O
would O
opt O
for O
a O
more O
expensive O
and O
larger O
unit O
. O

I O
would O
purchase O
again O
as O
it O
is O
less O
costly O
and O
gives O
the O
same O
performance O
. O

We O
liked O
that O
these O
have O
the O
power O
of O
a O
desktop O
( O
and O
we O
needed O
that O
power O
) O
, O
but O
we O
also O
love O
the O
portability O
. O

but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
spare O
, O
then O
you O
're O
golden O
. O

but O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
around O
$ O
17 O
. O

It O
's O
small O
, O
lightweight O
, O
has O
a O
keyboard O
( O
something O
that O
I O
miss O
when O
using O
a O
tablet O
) O
and O
the O
battery O
lasts O
longer O
than O
any O
laptop O
I O
've O
owned O
. O

But O
it O
gets O
to O
a O
point O
( O
after O
a O
loooong O
time O
) O
and O
then O
just O
freezes O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
the O
BEST O
of O
any O
laptop O
made O
- O
just O
gorgeous O
. O

usb O
fast O

, O
camera O
and O

, O
and O
so O
much O
more5 O
) O
great O
screen O

) O

Unlike O
some O
other O
cords O
I O
've O
ordered O
, O
this O
one O
charges O
, O
and O
has O
worked O
perfectly O
. O

The O
speakers O
do O
not O
take O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
on O
the O
desktop O
, O
look O
nice O
, O
and O
have O
easily O
reachable O
volume O
controls O
on O
top O
of O
the O
right O
speaker O
if O
you O
want O
to O
control O
volume O
from O
the O
speakers O
instead O
of O
your O
laptop O
. O

With O
any O
ultrabook O
relying O
on O
a O
fan O
for O
cooling O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
this O
issue O
. O

Got O
it O
, O
charged O
it O
, O
connected O
it O
. O

I O
had O
the O
same O
experience O
as O
others O
who O
found O
the O
pen O
less O
accurate O
than O
a O
mouse O
for O
the O
same O
purposes O
. O

Now O
I O
can O
keep O
them O
organized O
on O
the O
ones O
that O
I O
have O
pictures O
on O
that O
I O
no O
longer O
need O
and O
have O
emptied O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
pictures O
on O
. O

try O
it O
you O
wo O
nt O
be O
disapointed O
. O

I O
pulled O
it O
out O
of O
the O
packaging O
, O
put O
it O
in O
a O
usb O
port O
- O
let O

do O

( O
found O

Apple O
has O
a O
really O
light O
connection O
to O
their O
laptops O
and O
the O
sell O
it O
as O
a O
feature O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
saying O
words O
you O
never O
even O
knew O
existed O
. O

You O
can O
find O
software O
options O
that O
will O
keep O

from O
going O
to O
sleep O
( O
some O
without O
manipulating O
the O
mouse O
routines O
at O
all O
) O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
Mouse O
Jiggler O
because O
it O
can O
also O
be O
used O
to O
keep O
a O

remote O

the O

from O

I O
also O
have O
2 O

and O
I O
will O
continue O

the O

. O

The O
manual O
states O
that O
the O

will O
not O
charge O
the O

. O

If O
they O
made O
Keyboards O
I O
would O
buy O
one O

I O
managed O
to O
fit O
a O

and O
then O
enter O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
use O
with O
a O

as O
it O
does O
n't O
stick O
out O

My O
only O
reservations O
center O
on O
the O
relative O
paucity O
of O
native O
OS O

. O

I O
loved O
everything O
else O
about O

and O
disagreed O
with O
negative O
reviews O
about O
the O
battery O

-- O
it O
was O
impressive O

Getting O

would O

use O

The O

There O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
extra O
2 O
inches O

likely O
for O
the O

This O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
want O
it O
to O
do O
. O

Would O
recommend O
to O
anyone O

They O
work O
very O
well O

and O
I O
would O
definitely O
order O
them O
again O

Technically O
not O
Transformer O
's O
fault O
, O
but O
it O
contributes O
greatly O
to O
overall O
frustration O
using O
device O
: O
software O
buttons O
at O
the O
bottom O
deprive O
you O
of O
rather O
wide O
strip O
of O
valuable O

real O

( O
especially O
when O
in O
landscape O
orientation O
) O
, O
home O

other O
UI O
transitions O
are O
jerky O
despite O
quad O

processor O
, O
stock O
browser O
is O
not O
very O
good O
, O
bluetooth O

is O
flaky O

Hopefully O
, O
the O
improved O
transmission O
capability O
of O
the O
new O

( O
the O
old O

Love O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
. O

But O
I O
may O
still O
keep O
it O
, O
I O
really O
have O
no O
other O
complaint O
. O

Could O
n't O
afford O
to O
put O
the O
higher O
one O
in O
so O
am O
glad O
that O
this O
worked O
for O
her O
. O

USB O

locations O
could O
be O
better O
like O
a O
Samsung O
alternative O
. O

I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
good O
2 O
years O
before O
the O
connector O
dies O

If O
you O
look O
at O
different O
products O
online O

The O
docking O
station O
is O
slim O
and O
looks O
very O
nice O
. O

Scratchy O
, O
with O
a O
constant O
low O
crackle O
if O
volume O
is O
up O
more O
than O
1/3 O
the O
way O
. O

And O
, O

is O
hefty O

There O
is O
a O
nicely O
padded O

for O

Each O
can O
have O
multiple O

With O
this O

I O
can O
write O
directly O
on O
a O

or O
on O
a O

just O
like O

This O

for O

listening O
to O

As O
someone O
else O
posted O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
use O
this O
monitor O
as O
a O
desktop O

as O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
referencing O

would O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O

without O
having O
to O
switch O

. O

Great O
item O
, O
great O
price O
! O

It O
goes O
MUCH O
higher O
when O
connected O
by O
cable O
. O

The O
connections O
are O
a O
little O
fiddly O
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
design O
of O
the O
connectors O
, O
not O
a O
fault O
of O
the O
cable O
manufacturer O
. O

It O
's O
the O
smallest O
USB O
receiver O
you O
'll O
find O
on O
any O
mouse O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

The O
bass O
quickly O
dropped O
out O
on O
only O
half O
volume O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
on O
this O
computer O
that O
needs O
a O
ton O
of O
processing O
power O
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

The O
price O
was O
$ O
48 O
less O
than O
a O
local O
battery O
place O
wanted O
for O
the O
same O
battery O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
netbook O
for O
my O
application O
. O

Seagate O

At O
least O
I O
got O
it O
cheap O

The O

Battery O
is O
an O
exact O
fit O
to O
my O
HP O
Pavilion O

series O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
not O
as O
loud O
as O
I O
was O
expecting O

This O
lapdesk O
is O
nicely O
constructed O
and O
quite O
sturdy O
. O

I O
got O
this O
for O
use O
when O
I O
'm O
working O
out O
in O
the O
garage O
and O
listening O
to O
Pandora O
and O
IHeartRadio O
on O
my O
Xoom O
. O

Puzzling O
statement O
I O
know O
, O
let O
me O
explain O
myself O
. O

It O
almost O
fit O
except O
for O
the O
power O
cord O
jack O
. O

Set O
up O
and O
security O
set O
was O
fast O
and O
easy O
. O

My O
preference O
was O
for O
the O
cone O
shaped O
plugs O
and O
it O
's O
nice O
that O
they O
were O
included O
. O

I O
pick O
up O
several O
wireless O
networks O
with O
excellent O
signal O
strength O
. O

Went O
from O
1 O
bar O
to O
5 O
and O
now O
have O
dozens O
of O
wireless O
pop O
up O
in O
my O
menue O

of O
which O
were O
unsecured O
and O
can O
be O
used O
if O
others O
go O
away O
. O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
spend O
much O
time O
trying O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
yet.&#725 O

Relatively O
low O

" O
display O
and O

seem O
to O
be O
just O
about O
right O
for O
something O
that O
typically O
you O
'd O
be O
using O
to O
browse O
the O
Web O
while O
watching O
TV O
or O
take O
to O
and O
from O
school O
. O

It O
works O
GREAT O
! O
! O
! O

Battery O
is O
built O
- O
in O
, O
so O

only O
problem O
I O
have O
with O
it O
is O
that O
my O
vga O
cable O
does O
n't O
screw O
into O
it O
. O

Sticks O
out O
a O
little O
from O
the O
back O
of O
a O
Inspiron O

. O

My O
demands O
on O
it O
are O
likely O
less O
than O
most O
others O
but O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
it O
will O
do O
whatever O
it O
says O
it O
will O
do O
. O

This O
item O
works O
just O
as O
described O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
several O
of O
the O
models O
in O
the O
SimplyVibe O
line O
and O
, O
overall O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
. O

The O
first O
one O
worked O
fine O
. O

The O
fan O
is O
also O
very O
quiet O
. O

The O
battery O
certainly O
does O
not O
last O
11 O
. O
5 O
hours O
as O
advertised O
but O
it O
does O
go O
4 O
+ O
hours O
. O

is O
solid O
. O

These O
work O
just O
fine O
for O
things O
like O
videoconferencing O
and O
voice O
recording O
, O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
about O
stereo O
or O
high O
quality O
. O

It O
's O
my O
3rd O
battery O
for O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
figured O
it O
would O
just O
be O
easier O
to O
buy O
something O
with O
Linux O
pre O
- O
installed O
than O
go O
through O
the O
trouble O
of O
finding O
a O
distribution O
that O
supports O
your O
machine O
's O
hardware O
. O

so O
I O
've O
got O
this O
little O
jobb'r O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
all O
that O
excited O
about O
. O

That O
said O
, O
I O
have O
had O
poor O
experiences O
with O
the O
longevity O
of O
HP O
machines O
in O
the O
past O
, O
particularly O
due O
to O
over O
- O
heating O
. O

Now O
bear O
in O
mind O

This O
replacement O
dock O
is O
slightly O
better O
and O
cheaper O
than O
the O
one O
provided O
by O
Apple O
for O
the O
Shuffle O
. O

Compared O
to O
that O
full O
- O
size O
keyboard O
, O
this O
one O
does O
feel O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
I O
love O
the O
convenience O
of O
having O
everything O
in O
one O
case O
. O

The O
unibody O
provides O
strength O
, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
this O
notebook O
is O
very O
solid O
. O

Having O
been O
burnt O
several O
times O
with O
cheap O
" O
knock O
off O
" O
Taiwan O
electronics O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
with O
a O
slightly O
higher O
priced O
but O
reputable O
Taiwan O
name O
. O

So O
tightly O
that O
it O
's O
not O
plausible O
to O
keep O
sticking O
it O
in O
and O
taking O
it O
out O
every O
time O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
not O
too O
annoying O

Well O
, O
I O
guess O
you O
like O
' O
em O
" O
. O

The O
problem O
was O
the O
cord O
that O
was O
shipped O
with O
the O
enclosure O
. O

The O
computer O
has O
a O
built O
in O
camera O
and O
microphone O
, O
and O
I O
find O
both O
are O
just O
superb O
for O
both O
close O
up O
and O
distance O
use O
, O
I O
sit O
about O
12 O
feet O
back O
from O
where O
the O
computer O
is O
when O
using O
the O
camera O
and O
microphone O
with O
Skype O
and O
the O
people O
I O
talk O
to O
say O
the O
picture O
and O
audio O
is O
very O
good O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
installed O
& O
worked O
the O
first O
time O
without O
any O
issue O
. O

But O
before O
that O
a O
little O
background O
. O

It O
holds O
all O
my O
Canon O
DSLR O
, O
three O
lenses O
( O
room O
for O
more O
) O
, O
hoods O
, O
and O
gadgets O
. O

Ca O
n't O
be O
more O
happy O
. O

No O
problems O
whatsoever O
connecting O
via O
bluetooth O
. O

This O
PCB O
is O
excellent O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
four O
of O
these O
for O
over O
two O
years O
now O
-- O
two O
new O
ones O
and O
two O
refurbished O
. O

the O
reader O
to O
know O
that O
this O
is O
my O
first O
Mac O
- O
I O
've O
been O
set O
free O
from O
the O
PC O
world O
for O
the O
most O
part O
now O
and O
it O
is O
awesome O
! O

There O
's O
an O
advanced O
one O
you O
can O
mount O
to O
the O
hotshoe O
. O

Our O
company O
has O
tried O
a O
number O
of O
similar O
HDMI O
to O
HDMI O
devices O
for O
presentations O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
my O
laptop O
has O
built O
in O
Bluetooth O
that O
works O
in O
conjuction O
with O
my O
WIFI O
switch O
. O

I O
had O
4 O
GB O
and O
it O
was O
very O
slow O
... O

The O
disappointment O
came O
after O
I O
plugged O
it O
and O
turn O
it O
on O
... O
it O
hardly O
moves O
any O
air O
and O
the O
motor O
is O
powerful O
, O
too O
powerful O
, O
that O
its O
shakes O
the O
tiny O
Thinkpad O
laptop O
that O
it O
is O
plugged O
to O
. O

it O
is O
the O
perfect O
length O
, O
and O
will O
work O
great O
for O
me O
. O

Ended O
up O
not O
needing O
the O
second O
one O
as O
the O
travel O
adapter O
already O
had O
a O
right O
angle O
plug O
on O
it O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
1000HE O
since O
May O
and O
love O
it O
. O

but O
you O
really O
need O
to O
know O
something O
to O
put O
in O

The O
laptop O
connecter O
is O
sturdier O
and O
other O
components O
appear O
to O
be O
adequate O
. O

Finally O
, O
when O
I O
remove O
my O
phone O
from O
the O
cradle O
whatever O
was O
playing O
is O
paused O
and O
eveyrthing O
works O
fine O
otherwise O
. O

You O
'll O
start O
to O
realize O
when O
you O
let O
too O
much O
time O
go O
by O
. O

It O
retains O
a O
charge O
and O
it O
works O
well O
. O

The O
I O
disconnected O
the O
RCA O
output O
cables O
from O
a O
working O
VCR O
( O
so O
I O
know O
the O
RCA O
cables O
and O
HDTV O
input O
of O
those O
cables O
work O
) O
and O
connected O
the O
RCA O
video O
cable O
to O
this O
adapter O
and O
this O
adapter O
to O
the O
previously O
tested O
laptop O
VGA O
output O
, O
but O
nothing O
gets O
to O
the O
HDTV O
. O

20 O
minutes O
of O
work O
corrected O
months O
of O
putting O
up O
with O
charging O
issues O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
my O
Lenovo O
laptop O
and O
two O
monitors O
( O
full O
specs O
below O
) O
and O
it O
set O
up O
very O
quickly O
( O
just O
make O
sure O
you O
download O
the O
newest O
drivers O
from O
the O
DisplayLink O
website O
before O
plugging O
it O
in O
) O
and O
works O
almost O
flawlessly O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
user O
of O
their O
products O
including O
lcd O
monitors O
, O
motherboards O
and O
such O
, O
but O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
I O
will O
steer O
clear O
of O
their O
products O
due O
to O
this O
continuing O
problem O
. O

so O
time O
will O
tell O
. O

one O
time O
I O
unplugged O
it O
to O
use O
on O
another O
pc O
, O
and O
when O
I O
brought O
it O
back O
, O
I O
had O
to O
restart O
the O
pc O
to O
get O
it O
to O
recognize O
again O
. O

If O
you O
are O
cool O
with O
putting O
your O
super O
- O
expensive O
laptop O
in O
something O
that O
damages O
it O
( O
albeit O
not O
much O
) O
then O
get O
this O
case O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
surprise O
about O
this O
cooling O
pad O
. O

I O
bought O
these O
tools O
for O
only O
a O
few O
dollars O
and O
was O
able O
to O
repair O
two O
very O
different O
types O
of O
tablets O
in O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
time O
I O
did O
without O
the O
tools O
and O
with O
no O
damage O
to O
the O
tablets O
. O

What O
else O
do O
you O
need O
. O

My O
tablet O
fits O
it O
perfectly O
and O
the O
keyboard O
is O
excellent O
with O
good O
spacing O
yet O
still O
compact O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
, O
and O
if O
it O
ever O
happens O
, O
I O
'll O
update O
this O
review O
. O

The O
HooToo O
is O
well O
labeled O
, O
but O
not O
over O
labeled O
. O

What O
more O
needs O
to O
be O
said O
? O

I O
may O
have O
been O
easily O
preventable O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
receive O
any O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
even O
apply O
it O
. O

( O
I O
do O
n't O
play O
games O
on O
it O

The O
price O
( O
Currently O
$ O
12 O
. O
99 O
) O
is O
very O
appealing O
for O
anyone O
wanting O
an O
enclosure O

One O
thing O
I O
did O
n't O
see O
mentioned O
in O
the O
description O
is O
that O
there O
's O
a O
stiff O
plastic O
dual O
- O
pocket O
stitched O
onto O
the O
inside O
wall O
, O
which O
is O
designed O
to O
hold O
a O
couple O
of O
SD O
cards O
. O

PROSSharp O
Screen O
, O
glossy O
screens O
appear O
more O
sharp O
and O
crisp O
than O
non O
glare O
, O
just O
for O
art O
and O
photo O
editing O
, O
it O
's O
annoying O
in O
brighter O
light O
to O
everything O
reflected O
in O
it O
. O

Material O
is O
soft O
and O
protects O
the O
MBA O
well O
. O

and O
then O
the O
side O
buttons O
would O
n't O
need O

The O
scrolling O
works O
only O
if O
you O
increase O
the O
thickness O
of O
the O
scroll O
strip O
. O

I O
paired O
it O
up O
with O
my O
desktop O
first O
, O
and O
it O
went O
right O
to O
work O
. O

Not O
a O
bad O
mouse O
, O
but O
not O
a O
great O
one O
, O
either O
. O

Almost O
like O
putting O
on O
a O
sock O
for O
it O
. O

A O
negative O
for O
many O
is O
two O
hours O
less O
battery O
reserve O
than O
the O
Samsung O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
the O
larger O
screen O
and O
decided O
I O
could O
live O
with O
this O
shortcoming O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
beauty O
to O
replace O
an O
aging O
desktop O
pc O
that O
was O
noisy O
and O
generating O
too O
much O
heat O
. O

Having O
the O
iPhone O
, O
and O
therefore O
needing O
it O
upside O
down O
in O
order O
to O
put O
it O
in O
the O
cradle O
, O
is O
odd O
, O
so O
what O
I O
just O
do O
is O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
do O
n't O
bother O
with O
the O
cradle O
. O

I O
was O
amazed O
how O
much O
it O
cooled O
down O
my O
Macbook O
pro O
in O
a O
short O
time O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
my O
next O
one O
will O
be O
also O
. O

Sound O
is O
weak O
but O
passable O
although O
the O
speakers O
are O
front O

As O
it O
stands O
now O
, O
he O
ca O
n't O
carry O
a O
bag O
that O
looks O
worn O
out O
and O
frayed O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
find O
him O
a O
leather O
bag O
that O
opens O
the O
way O
the O
Skooba O
bag O
does O
. O

Harman O
owns O
JBL O
) O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
before O
Christmas O
and O
used O
it O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
until O
the O
battery O
died O
. O

It O
even O
fit O
my O
cord O
to O
charge O
my O
laptop O
and O
delivery O
date O
was O
right O
on O
time O
. O

The O
power O
cord O
is O
n't O
in O
the O
best O
spot O
, O
interferes O
with O
the O
mouse O
since O
I O
'm O
right O
handed O
. O

You O
would O
n't O
think O
that O
a O
10 O
" O
screen O
would O
make O
such O
a O
difference O
over O
a O
9 O
" O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
-- O
it O
does O
. O

I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
so O
far O
. O

Setting O
up O
the O
bluetooth O
was O
very O
easy O
, O
it O
took O
me O
less O
then O
5 O
min O
. O

I O
figured O
it O
might O
be O
the O
old O
drive O
enclosures O
giving O
out O
, O
tried O
it O
again O
, O
but O
with O
those O
drives O
connected O
directly O
to O
the O
systems O
SATA O
controller O
, O
same O
result O
. O

I O
did O
have O
to O
reset O
my O
paging O
file O
size O
to O
match O
the O
new O
memory O
size O
, O
but O
other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
know O
anything O
about O
computers O
to O
make O
this O
modification O
to O
my O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
NOT O
a O
good O
speaker O
for O
music O
- O
the O
sound O
quality O
directly O
from O
the O
tiny O
built O

in O

in O

It O
's O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
log O
on O

without O
typing O
a O
password O
. O

It O
could O
just O
be O
my O

, O
but O
there O
could O
be O
others O
out O
there O
with O
the O
same O
issue O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
cost O

THIS O
IS O
THE O
ONE O
TO O
GET O
! O

Now O
there O
are O
some O
good O
features O
and O

you O
may O

you O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
and O
believe O
there O
are O
much O
better O
products O
on O
the O
market O
now O
. O

quick O
update O
: O
the O
issue O
concerning O
the O
sudoku O
game O
was O
resolved O
. O

The O
handle O
is O
not O
aligned O
along O
the O
center O
of O
gravity O
making O
it O
useless.- O
There O
is O
no O
padding O
for O
the O
laptop O
on O
the O
side O
closest O
to O
your O
body.- O

Within O
a O
few O
hours O
after O
installing O
this O
replacement O
batter O
, O
my O
computer O
became O
very O
over O
heated O
and O
permanently O
damaged O
my O
computer O
. O

The O
company O
is O
being O
good O
on O
the O
return O
, O
but O
I O
could O
have O
saved O
myself O
the O
hassle O
( O
& O
them O
too O
) O

Logged O
onto O
hotel O
wifi O
and O
streamed O
Amazon O
and O
Netflix O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
throw O
this O
in O
a O
bag O
and O
it O
travels O
well O
. O

so O
I O
purchased O
this O
one O
and O
what O
I O
noticed O
is O
that O
my O
battery O
indicator O
shows O
a O
much O
longer O
battery O
life O
after O
each O
charge O
. O

No O
chemical O
smell O
as O
is O
common O
in O
cheaper O
models O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
champ O
and O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
and O
you O
can O
double O
up O
in O
the O
individual O
pockets O
if O
needed O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
its O
radiant O
black O
distinctive O
colors O
are O
actually O
BETTER O
looking O
than O
the O
silver O
outdated O
and O
over O
populated O
colors O
of O
the O
Air O
. O

Besides O
, O
I O
knew O
before O
buying O
that O
the O
card O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
6 O
- O
6 O
cable O
. O

For O
those O
who O
want O
to O
use O
there O
video O
games O
on O
the O
AppRadio O
, O
the O
answer O
is O

It O
runs O
the O
wonderful O
new O
OS2008 O
and O
there O
are O
185 O
+ O
free O
applications O
you O
can O
easily O
load O
at O

So O
I O
guess O
it O
really O
comes O
down O
to O
durability O
and O
the O
way O
it O
" O
feels O
" O
when O
you O
are O
hooking O
it O
up O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
I O
've O
discovered O
so O
far O
is O
that O
the O
software O
and O
pen O
combination O
are O
tethered O
to O
one O
computer O
. O

I O
now O
appreciate O
just O
how O
bad O
Windows O
machines O
really O
are O
with O
all O
the O
bloatware O
and O
lockups O
and O
other O
quirky O
things O
we O
have O
all O
tolerated O
over O
the O
years O
. O

I O
work O
with O
computers O
for O
a O
living O

I O
ca O
n't O
really O
review O
this O
item O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
fit O
my O
notebook O
. O

So O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
pay O
more O
per O
gigabyte O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
drive O
I O
could O
trust O
. O

Therefore O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
laptop O
and O
not O
the O
battery O
. O

Conclusion O
: O
It O
is O
still O
a O
good O
deal O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
a O
portable O
machine O
with O
reasonable O
computing O
power O
for O
travel O
or O
as O
a O
backup O
machine O
. O

I O
also O
have O
the O
Medialink O
router O
and O
it O
is O
also O
very O
good O
! O

This O
battery O
is O
reasonably O
priced O
and O
has O
given O
new O
life O
to O
our O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
great O
for O
a O
number O
of O
uses O
, O
but O
for O
writing O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
case O
with O
a O
built O
- O
in O
keyboard O
, O
basically O
turning O
my O
iPad O
into O
a O
laptop O
, O
but O
with O
all O
the O
inherent O
limitations O
of O
an O
iPad O
and O
a O
chiclet O
keyboard O
. O

This O
review O
may O
be O
revised O
downward O
in O
the O
future O
if O
longevity O
issues O
arise O
. O

Instructions O
for O
using O
the O
BTD-400 O
are O
sketchy O
. O

i O
love O
the O
extra O
slim O
design O
. O

Beautifully O
made O
of O
quality O
materials O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
powerful O
tablet O
with O
full O
PC O
capabilities O
that O
will O
totally O
blow O
away O
any O
Android O
tablet O
or O
iPad O
, O
then O
this O
is O
your O
baby O
. O

Plays O
DVDs O
well O
. O

Really O
quiet O
, O
keeps O
the O
laptop O
cool O
. O

That O
funny O
hole O
through O
it O
is O
really O
a O
cable O
pass O
through O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
portable O
hard O
drive O
to O
go O
with O
my O
Toshiba O
Laptop O
. O

I O
merely O
plug O
in O
the O
product O
and O
drag O
and O
drop O
the O
folders O
I O
wish O
to O
backup O
to O
the O
designated O
folders O
I O
created O
on O
the O
drive O
. O

The O
Moster O
strip O
keeps O
the O
phones O
, O
MP3 O
players O
and O
GPS O
all O
in O
one O
spot O
. O

After O
which O
when O
you O
click O
" O
NAV O
" O
to O
find O
the O
route O
, O
it O
may O
take O
as O
long O
as O
30s O
! O

Installation O
was O
easy O
, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
is O
great O
. O

Pressing O
a O
key O
on O
the O
keyboard O
should O
wake O
it O
up O
, O
and O
is O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
're O
simply O
using O
it O
to O
type O
in O
- O
frequently O
( O
like O
searching O
for O
a O
title O
on O
Amazon O
instant O
video O
, O
etc).I O
was O
able O
to O
sync O
the O
keyboard O
to O
my O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
Note O
3 O
( O
which O
was O
cool O
) O
and O
use O
it O
alongside O
a O
bluetooth O
mouse O
. O

The O
Xoom O
and O
Galaxy O
were O
priced O
too O
high O
for O
me O
, O
the O
Toshiba O
Thrive O
was O
appealing O
, O
but O
the O
Sony O
32 O
GB O
was O
what O
really O
caught O
my O
eye O
. O

VGA O
port- O
SuperDrive O
( O
DVD O
burner O
) O
is O
optional O
on O
PowerBook O

It O
comes O
with O
a O
Win O
7 O
recovery O
diskette O
. O

both O
liked O
its O
ergonomic O
qualities;it O
adjusted O
to O
both O
our O
laps O
just O
fine O
. O

This O
is O
only O
a O
first O
impression O
. O

It O
is O
instantly O
more O
striking O
but O
both O
look O
great O
. O

It O
did O
its O
own O
updating O
, O
and O
offered O
me O
a O
few O
battery O
options O
right O
away O
. O

I O
've O
turned O
into O
one O
of O
those O
people O
who O
find O
it O
essential O
to O
have O
a O
briefcase O
on O
wheels O
. O

Airplane O
mode O
is O
desastrous O
, O
if O
the O
airplane O
outlet O
is O
not O
having O
enough O
power O
or O
if O
it O
is O
providing O
a O
12V O
outlet O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
controls O
work O
on O
it O
. O

That O
makes O
6 O
items O
for O
4 O
ports O
, O
then O
add O
the O
thumb O
drive O
that O
I O
use O
pretty O
regularly O

sadly O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
not O
to O
be O
the O
battery O
, O
but O
the O
adapter O
or O
whatever O
it O
's O
called O
. O

It O
took O
them O
two O
days O
to O
respond O
and O
then O
with O
a O
question O
about O
what O
type O
of O
laptop O
I O
had O
! O
! O

This O
is O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O
the O
screen O
. O

This O
case O
is O
very O
well O
made O
and O
has O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
my O
17 O
. O
3 O
" O
laptop O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
really O
bad O
. O

The O
only O
con O
is O
that O
I O
can O
see O
the O
opening O
being O
stretched O
out O
of O
shape O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
tight O
fit O
. O

This O
allows O
you O
to O
cut O
your O
power O
cable O
and O
put O
two O
boxes O
along O
the O
line O
which O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
use O
it O
to O
1 O
) O
charge O
the O
HyperJuice O
; O
2 O
) O
charge O
the O
MBA O
from O
the O
HyperJuice O
; O
and O
3 O
) O
charge O
both O
the O
HyperJuice O
and O
MBA O
at O
the O
same O
time O
on O
the O
same O
cord O
. O

if O
you O
want O
a O
light O
weight O
and O
compact O
case O
for O
laptop O
then O
go O
for O
it O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
only O
works O
on O
Macs O
with O
Intel O
processor O
? O

Not O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
speaker O
package O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
recommend O
this O
, O
unless O
it O
fits O
what O
you O
need O
it O
to O
do O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
well O
with O
the O
galaxy O
s3 O
, O
it O
HARDLY O
charges O
it O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
ruined O
my O
battery O
because O
ever O
since O
I O
connected O
it O
to O
my O
phone O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
may O
have O
too O
much O
unwanted O
software O
on O
it O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
cord O
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
found O
. O

Disconnecting O
is O
not O
a O
huge O
issue O
you O
just O
reconnect O
from O
your O
tablet O
and O
takes O
about O
20 O
sec O
. O

If O
you O
drop O
it O
, O
it O
might O
help O
with O
scuffing O
, O
but O
the O
impact O
damage O
wo O
n't O
be O
reduced O
much O
. O

Best O
Buy O
and O

The O
pics O
are O
clear O
and O
easy O
to O
operate O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
iLap O
arrived O
a O
day O
latter O
and O
was O
totally O
unusable O
. O

This O
is O
mainly O
just O
picky O
devices O
that O
only O
like O
to O
charge O
with O
the O
manufacturer O
supplied O
charger O
. O

and O
4x O
DVD O
read O
spread O
for O
those O
who O
are O
using O
this O
as O
I O
am O
. O

It O
allows O
you O
to O
place O
the O
camera O
on O
top O
of O
your O
screen O
or O
stand O
it O
on O
your O
table O
, O
and O
you O
can O
pivot O
it O
to O
any O
angle O
you O
want O
. O

One O
, O
it O
's O
uncomfortable O
with O
the O
heat O
from O
the O
laptop O
and O
two O
, O
the O
laptop O
is O
unstable O
and O
I O
'm O
always O
afraid O
it O
will O
slide O
off O
my O
lap O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
if O
you O
are O
into O
home O
computing O
like O
surfing O
the O
web O
, O
chatting O
, O
emailing O
and O
using O
office O
type O
software O
then O
this O
is O
not O
a O
recommended O
machine O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
adapter O
is O
buried O
in O
a O
cabinet O
and O
facing O
the O
wrong O
direction O
, O
the O
signal O
fills O
the O
large O
room O
and O
more O
. O

This O
product O
is O
almost O
perfect O
. O

What O
a O
phenomenal O
and O
vividly O
detailed O
LED O
screen O
. O

4ghz O
N O
wifi O
on O
this O
model O
. O

This O
device O
appears O
to O
come O
with O
12 O
GoGo O
passes O
to O
be O
used O
before O
2015 O
( O
12 O
x O
$ O
10=$120 O
) O
. O

It O
is O
super O
quiet O
, O
maybe O
will O
hear O
a O
fan O
every O
now O
and O
then O
. O

This O
is O
OWC O
's O
SUPERB O
information O
site O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
about O
12 O
mobile O
phones O
as O
of O
now O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
online O
, O
the O
wireless O
adapter O
issues O
come O
from O
the O
adapter O
being O
very O
new O
and O
not O
" O
playing O
well O
" O
with O
older O
routers O
. O

The O
software O
downloaded O
from O
the O
internet O
from O
Microsoft O
. O

Sadly O
, O
the O
Aspire O
3680 O
is O
n't O
known O
for O
good O
power O
management O
and O
even O
with O
this O
7800mah O
batt O
, O
uptime O
is O
only O
4 O
hours O
( O
4 O
. O
5 O
if O
you O
pray O
, O
turn O
off O
the O
wifi O
, O
and O
dim O
the O
screen O
to O
50 O
% O
) O
. O

Again O
the O
design O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
sturdiest O
but O
it O
does O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

but O
it O
just O
wiggles O
around O
a O
bit O
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
very O
secure O
at O
all O
. O

These O
cables O
seem O
to O
be O
off O
good O
quality O
. O

There O
are O
other O
cable O
management O
systems O
out O
there O
for O
less O
and O
diy O
solutions O
as O
well O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
that O
probably O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
USB O
cable O
and O
stand O
that O
they O
use O
. O

along O
the O
center O
line O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
I O
have O
a O
70 O
- O
200 O

. O
8 O
and O
a O
50 O
1 O
. O
8 O
on O
one O
side O
and O
2 O
flashes O
and O
a O
set O
of O
4 O
radio O
trigger O
on O
the O
other O
size O
( O
you O
can O
easily O
put O
a O
small O
zoom O
in O
place O
of O
the O
radio O
triggers O
) O
. O

The O
outside O
design O
of O
this O
is O
what O
differentiated O
it O
for O
me O
. O

You O
have O
to O
reset O
router O
to O
factory O
defaults O
and O
have O
to O
reinstall O
desktop O
utility O
to O
make O
it O
work.- O

Overall O
, O
I O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
mid O
to O
small O
size O
laptops O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
like O
is O
you O
do O
not O
need O
a O
power O
cord O
for O
this O
one O
! O

The O
cables O
are O
too O
short O
to O
reach O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
monitor O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
PC O
. O

Acer O
needs O
a O
new O
BIO O
for O
this O
, O
or O
perhaps O
Windows7 O
will O
rectify O
this O
dilemma O
. O

Consider O
adding O
at O
least O
another O
256.- O
internal O
fan O
is O
sometime O
annoying O
when O
you O
do O
heavy O
graphics O
/ O
calculation O
. O

Sent O
it O
back O
. O

The O
SSD O
caching O
really O
helps O
when O
it O
's O
being O
utilized O
, O
but O
32 O
gb O
only O
goes O
so O
far O
, O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
this O
is O
coming O
from O
somebody O
who O
only O
uses O
solid O
state O
storage O
in O
his O
primary O
computer O
, O
so O
it O
may O
be O
perfect O
for O
you O
. O

In O
photos O
, O
that O
large O
area O
that O
says O
G13 O
on O
the O
bottom O
is O
actually O
a O
big O
chunk O
of O
metal O
. O

I O
know O
that O
some O
people O
are O
n't O
going O
to O
be O
pleased O
with O
a O
less O
than O
glowing O
review O
of O
this O
VX2453MH O
- O
LED O
, O
but O
let O
me O
explain O
my O
disappointment O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
speak O
for O
battery O
life O
or O
keyboard O
life O
for O
that O
matter O
but O
will O
come O
back O
and O
update O
this O
review O
if O
I O
have O
any O
issues O
with O
this O
device O
. O

The O
restore O
software O
makes O
two O
80 O
GB O
partitions O
( O
' O

' O
and O
' O

) O
that O
will O
DESTROY O
any O
other O
custom O
OS O
's O
you O
may O
have O
set O
up O
. O

Product O
worked O
fine O
for O
the O
first O
3 O
weeks O
, O
then O
it O
started O
to O
fail O
. O

but O
if O
I O
am O
the O
only O
one O
listening O
to O
the O
music O
I O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O
headphones O
over O
this O
. O

Not O
as O
nice O
as O
the O
other O
one O
but O
nice O
enough O
and O
super O
cheap O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
is O
somewhat O
difficult O
to O
see O
outdoors O
in O
sunlight O
-- O
too O
much O
glare O
! O

that O
is O
is O
still O
great O
. O

Nicely O
built O
but O
pretty O
pricey O
. O

The O
touch O
surface O
is O
not O
very O
precise O
( O
making O
fine O
movements O
difficult O
) O
and O
the O
clicking O
action O
is O
squishy O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
a O
little O
thick O
, O
which O
is O
fine O
with O
me O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
a O
nice O
MP3 O
Boombox O
, O
the O
usability O
of O
the O
folder O
menu O
had O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

for O
the O

did O
not O
expect O

As O
far O
as O
the O
Pi O
is O
concerned O
it O
works O
great O
as O
a O

A O
little O
bubble O

goes O
a O
long O
way O
. O

It O
is O
because O
of O
the O

. O

I O
got O
one O

Even O
sitting O

November O
9 O
, O
2008I O
purchased O
the O
Samsung O
LCD O
HDTV O
yesterday O
from O
our O
most O
respected O
appliance O
dealer O
here O
in O
Long O
Island O
, O
New O
York O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
was O
a O
choice O
to O
chose O
iTunes O
to O
come O
over O
during O
the O
migration O
. O

Create O
a O
secondary O
account O
called O
" O
local O
account O
" O
and O
set O
that O
up O
as O
the O
Administrator O
instead O
. O

The O
PC O
is O
truly O
loaded O
with O
options O
. O

I O
returned O
it O
for O
another O
and O
that O
one O
did O
n't O
even O
work O
. O

I O
had O
one O
fail O
within O
a O
month O
, O
another O
after O
3 O
months O
, O
two O
of O
them O
are O
going O
strong O
still O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
mic O
itself O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
speak O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
sound O

I O
was O
constantly O
running O
out O
of O
space O
on O
my O
16 O
gb O
iPad O
that O
wo O
n't O
happen O
for O
a O
while O
on O
my O
Prime O
with O
its O
expandable O
memory O
. O

The O
processor O
is O
okay O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
PCMCIA O
slot O
, O
you O
probably O
never O
even O
noticed O
it O
, O
because O
this O
is O
technology O
on O
the O
way O
out O
, O
and O
if O
you O
do O
have O
reason O
to O
use O
your O
PCMCIA O
card O
slot O
, O
why O
waste O
the O
single O
available O
slot O
on O
this O
old O
- O

Summary O
: O
A O
very O
heavy O
duty O
backpack O
/ O
book O
bag O
targeted O
to O
students O
, O
with O
much O
left O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
integration O
of O
the O
battery O
pack O
- O
the O
sum O
of O
parts O
is O
less O
than O
the O
whole O
. O

It O
always O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
blue O
tint O
after O
using O
my O
calibration O
tools O
and O
does O
n't O
appear O

; O
for O
very O
long O
. O

; O
was O
going O
to O
be O
too O
small O

It O
is O
cheap O
and O
it O
works O
... O
great O
for O
travel O
, O
home O
, O
& O
office O
... O
at O
this O
price O
, O
you O
can O
trade O
them O
with O
your O
friends O
if O
you O
wish O
... O

" O
Imagine O
the O
look O
on O
my O
face O
... O

Would O
buy O
again O
if O
I O
needed O
it O
for O
another O
computer O
. O

LCanon O

The O
computer O
must O
first O
recognize O
the O
dervice O
, O
enabled O
it O
, O
pair O
it O
, O
and O
then O
send O
music O
too O
it O

it O
is O
very O
good O
, O
never O
failed O
. O

Mine O
are O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
keyboard O
on O
my O
laptop O
close O
to O
my O
wrist O
and O
the O
light O
fixture O
itself O
gets O
in O
the O
way O
a O
little O
. O

Price O
is O
good O
. O

to O
protect O
the O
laptop O
but O
it O
turned O
up O
with O
an O
ingrained O
yellow O
stain O
on O
the O
top O
cover O
. O

I O
was O
not O
initially O
a O
fan O
of O
Windows O
8 O
but O
after O
a O
week O
of O
playing O
around O
with O
it O
, O
resetting O
some O
defaults O
, O
dumping O
some O
bloatware O
and O
just O
getting O
the O
feel O
for O
it O

Now O
for O
graphics O
, O
boy O
I O
really O
love O
the O
" O
switchable O
graphics O
, O

It O
is O
definitely O
helpful O
to O
have O
, O
but O
it O
should O
have O
been O
made O
slightly O
bigger O
. O

Per O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
author O
of O
one O
of O
my O
photo O
books O
, O
I O
checked O
the O
accuracy O
of O
this O
little O
beauty O
( O
yes O
, O
it O
is O
pretty O
cool O
looking O
) O
. O

The O
side O
compartment O
is O
great O
to O
store O
my O
portable O
AC O
power O
adapter O
and O
digital O
camera O
. O

i O
had O
mine O
on O
noch O
3 O
and O
some O
one O
says O
its O
loud O
. O

Low O
amperage O
usage O
on O
the O
12V O
computer O
BUS O
. O

this O
is O
a O
pretty O
good O
computer O
, O
honestly O
i O
do O
nt O
care O
about O
touchscreen O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
......... O
to O
be O
able O
to O
format O
it O
and O
install O
windows O
7 O
, O
but O
honestly O
that O
fix O
the O
problem O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

Any O
time O
of O
year O
this O
power O
supply O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
marvelous O
warming O
coaster O
or O
food O
warmer O
, O
keeping O
your O
beverage O
or O
meal O
piping O
hot O
for O
hours O
. O

Having O
sustained O
a O
wrist O
injury O
from O
too O
much O
computer O
use O
, O
I O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
. O

but O
I O
love O
that O
each O
is O
controlled O
by O
its O
own O
switch O
so O
I O
can O
turn O
them O
off O
and O
on O
and O
customize O
everything O
. O

The O
physical O
device O
itself O
is O
a O
bit O
flimsy O
though O
, O
it O
has O
warped O
such O
that O
all O
4 O
corners O
do O
not O
touch O
and O
just O
typing O
on O
the O
keyboard O
makes O
the O
lid O
rock O
back O
and O
forth O
. O

I O
have O
two O
of O
them O
and O
they O
both O
sound O
and O
work O
better O
than O
the O
IM-237 O
. O

This O
is O
the O
one O
to O
buy O
! O

The O
only O
internal O
zipper O
closes O
a O
large O
compartment O
sized O
for O
papers O
. O

But O
apparently O
, O
there O
are O
a O
few O
lemons O
out O
there O
. O

It O
provides O
unlimited O
phone O
support O
and O
hardware O
diagnosis O
. O

That O
's O
how O
I O
use O
this O
one O
, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
you O
ca O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
it O
and O
the O
Apple O
one O
as O
far O
as O
quality O
! O

Internal O
bluetooth O
works O
perfect O
with O
a O
bluetooth O
mouse O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
dozens O
of O
PC O
's O
since O
my O
first O
IBM O
PC O
in O
1982 O
. O

Music O
sounds O
rich O
when O
played O
. O

the O
cable O
that O
connects O
the O
hub O
to O
the O
PC O
could O
be O
a O
little O
longer O
( O
6 O
to O
12 O
inches O
would O
be O
ideal).I've O
also O
used O
it O
on O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
and O
it O
simply O
works O
, O
plug'n'play O
. O

Way O
bigger O
than O
the O
freebie O
cloths O
that O
come O
with O
glasses O
and O
such O
. O

It O
performs O
similarly O
to O
m O
original O
battery O
which O
is O
really O
abysmal O
even O
by O
yesterday O
's O
standards O
which O
is O
around O
1 O
1/2 O
hours O
to O
2 O
hours O
max O
in O
a O
real O
life O
setting O
-- O
just O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
do O
a O
PowerPoint O
presentation O
with O
a O
review O
. O

It O
's O
super O
convenient O
to O
have O
a O
two O
in O
one O
sleeve O
. O

Disclosure O
: O
I O
received O
a O
sample O
product O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
providing O
this O
review O
. O

My O
case O
and O
CPU O
fans O
are O
louder O
than O
the O
PS O
fan O
. O

Not O
much O
to O
add O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
run O
serious O
applications O
with O
a O
tablet O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
portability O
with O
a O
PC O
- O

There O
is O
a O
large O
open O
pocket O
in O
the O
back O
which O
I O
use O
for O
on O
the O
go O
things O
. O

I O
got O
one O
through O
Amazon O
and O
three O
from O
Tiger O
Direct O
. O

For O
the O
first O
few O
times O
, O
I O
got O
3 O
hours O
out O
of O
it- O
actually O
a O
bit O
less O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Replacement O
battery O
for O
a O
notebook O
. O

If O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
the O
free O
camera O
I O
won O
at O
work O
in O
2003 O

but O
anytime O
you O
drop O
a O
PC O
no O
matter O
what O
s O
protecting O
it O

only O
concern O
is O
that O
it O
's O
made O
cheaply O
so O
i O
have O
to O
ensure O
not O
to O
bang O
it O
around O
or O

so O
no O
stars O
off O
for O
that O
either O
. O

The O
bag O
dimensions O
are O
huge O
, O
but O
looking O
inside O
the O
space O
utilization O
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

My O
printer O
was O
too O
far O
from O
my O
PC O
, O
so O
this O
cable O
made O
it O
easy O
to O
reach O
and O
works O
great O
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
the O
product O
. O

Its O
a O
Perfect O
Mouse O
because O
i O
can O
do O
all O
more O
fast O
than O
my O
old O
mouse O
. O

I O
also O
trust O
products O
from O
Goja O
since O
I O
've O
been O
really O
pleased O
with O
all O
my O
purchases O
and O
have O
n't O
been O
disappointed O
by O
them O
yet O
. O

BUT O
, O
it O
's O
not O
really O
blue O
when O
it O
says O
" O
ice O
blue O
" O
. O

This O
works O
exactly O
how O
I O
want O
. O

what O
could O
go O
wrong???"HP O
does O
n't O
seem O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
fix O
it O
, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

Its O
design O
is O
sharp O
on O
ends O
, O
really O
? O

Again O
, O
if O
you O
buy O
a O
transformer O
tablet O
, O
this O
is O
a O
must O
. O

There O
is O
no O
room O
for O
a O
tripod O
. O

Decent O
battery O
life- O

The O
design O
/ O
styling O
is O
a O
bit O
clunky O
. O

the O
" O
Mac O
tax O
" O
is O
still O
there O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
nearly O
as O
high O
as O
I O
thought O
( O
on O
this O
machine O
, O
it O
's O
probably O
a O
chunk O
of O
change O
somewhere O
in O
the O
$ O
500 O
- O
600 O
range O
, O
but O
it O
is O
less O
than O
the O
$ O
1 O
, O
200 O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
immediately O
test O
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
play O
netflix O
from O
my O
couch O
about O
14 O
feet O
away O
without O
a O
loss O
of O
frame O
rate O
or O
delay O
in O
audio O
. O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
buy O
it O
for O
windows O
either O
. O

I O
think O
this O
little O
device O
was O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
and O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
for O
any O
bluetooth O
products O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
still O
amazed O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
picture O
and O
it O
's O
the O
best O
TV O
I O
've O
owned O
to O
date O
. O

I O
tried O
using O
a O
bluetooth O
mouse O
with O
this O
machine O
. O

This O
means O
that O
sometimes O
I O
unplug O
it O
. O

At O
least O
the O
light O
changes O
from O
red O
to O
blue O
when O
it O
's O
done O
. O

- O
basically O
I O
converted O
a O
full O
- O
length O
movie O
to O
another O
format O
. O

You O
should O
see O
that O
the O
BIOS O
shows O
2048 O
GB O
RAM O
. O

Basically O
, O
the O
zipper O
handle O
for O
the O
body O
compartment O
was O
broken O
off O
and O
all O
4 O
of O
the O
horizontal O
lens O
dividers O
were O
missing O
. O

In O
general O
, O
this O
computer O
has O
been O
" O
on O
" O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
and O
has O
never O
crashed O
or O
hung O
- O
up O
. O

The O
first O
card O
failed O
within O
the O
first O
six O
months O
after O
purchase O
. O

would O
not O
connect O
to O
either O
. O

The O
32 O
GB O
storage O
is O
ample O
, O
although O
I O
have O
bought O
another O
32 O
GB O
MicroSD O
to O
be O
in O
safe O
side O
. O

But O
I O
can O
not O
see O
getting O
the O
hundred O
on O
and O
off O
applications O
they O
claim O
. O

Received O
this O
Sony O
laptop O
for O
1 O
week O
, O
first O
set O
up O
wireless O
, O
then O
downloaded O
and O
updated O
all O
windows O
7 O
patches O
( O
> O
50 O
) O
and O
VAIO O
patches O
. O

Then O
I O
found O
it O
would O
not O
work O
in O
F4 O
recovery O
mode O
anymore O
once O
upgraded O
to O
8 O
. O

If O
one O
is O
particularly O
interested O
in O
Microsoft O
Office O
with O
Powerpoint O
, O
or O
other O
rather O
common O
software O
, O
one O
could O
probably O
save O
a O
little O
money O
by O
shopping O
around O
for O
a O
machine O
with O
some O
pre O
- O
installed O
and/or O
bundled O
software O
. O

but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

I O
spoke O
with O
Asus O
tech O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
do O
a O
hard O
reset O
on O
the O
system O
... O

Taking O
that O
around O
on O
trips O
or O
to O
class O
was O
a O
pain O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
Logitech O
could O
do O
to O
improve O
this O
mouse O
would O
be O
to O
put O
about O
2 O
GB O
of O
flash O
memory O
on O
the O
receiver O
for O
Vista O
to O
use O
for O
ReadyBoost O
! O

Li O
- O
ion O
batteries O
have O
been O
known O
to O
explode O
and O
catch O
fire O
. O

" O
Easy O
" O
to O
install O
is O
just O
that O
- O
even O
I O
could O
do O
it O
! O

Easy O
and O
quick O
to O
setup O
for O
both O
hardware O
and O
software O
, O
fancy O
and O
interesting O
to O
watch O
TV O
on O
iPad O
. O

Radeon O
HD3200 O
graphics O
see O
to O
that O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
bag O
fits O
so O
perfectly O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
engineers O
did O
their O
homework O
and O
actually O
measured O
that O
little O
space O
under O
the O
seat O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
fits O
. O

Another O
5 O
star O
performance O
. O

I O
DID O
use O
the O
battery O
as O
recommended O
: O
fully O
charged O
battery O
, O
ran O
UNPLUGGED O
till O
close O
to O
diminished O
, O
then O
plugged O
/ O
charged O
again O
( O

I O
've O
liked O
Belkin O
's O
line O
of O
cables O
and O
connectors O
and O
have O
found O
them O
reliable O
and O
as O
described O
for O
other O
purchases O
and O
uses O
. O

And O
if O
your O
internet O
speed O
is O
not O
so O
great O
, O
getting O
more O
through O
a O
smaller O
pipe O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

One O
star O
deduction O
for O
the O
decidedly O
NOT O
frustration O
free O
packaging O
. O

when O
I O
got O
it O
they O
lied O

all O
wrapped O
in O
a O
diminutive O
aluminum O
frame O
. O

and O
then O
it O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
well O
padded O
slipcase O
to O
put O
into O
a O
backpack O
. O

This O
is O
minor O
, O
but O
I O
am O
always O
afraid O
I O
might O
accidentally O
touch O
the O
exposed O
circuit O
board O
of O
the O
hard O
drive O
when O
I O
am O
powering O
the O
drive O
up O
or O
removing O
it O
. O

and O
I O
've O
found O
it O
quite O
handy O
for O
keeping O
my O
coffee O
HOT O
( O
not O
just O
warm O
! O
) O
. O

Came O
quickly O
and O
was O
VERY O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

Worth O
every O
penny O
. O

This O
router O
serves O
but O
it O
could O
be O
a O
much O
better O
product O
than O
it O
is O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
pci O
cards O
is O
really O
hampering O
their O
sales O
of O
this O
product O
if O
you O
ask O
me O
. O

When O
I O
first O
clicked O
on O
the O
Music O
app O
, O
it O
downloaded O
all O
of O
my O
music O
library O
from O
Media O
Player O
to O
the O
Music O
app O
, O
and O
then O
I O
had O
all O
of O
my O
music O
in O
2 O
different O
places O
, O
and O
was O
therefore O
, O
taking O
up O
twice O
the O
memory O
space O
! O

The O
fan O
control O
however O
is O
a O
waste O
; O
The O
fans O
spin O
so O
quiet O
why O
would O
you O
want O
to O
slow O
them O
down O
. O

Had O
a O
different O
replacement O
before O
this O
one O
and O
it O
was O
much O
thinner O

You O
can O
reprogram O
the O
buttons O
and O
customize O
the O
color O
of O
the O
mouse O
. O

My O
pickiness O
aside O
, O
this O
case O
will O
easily O
hold O
a O
laptop O
, O
your O
AC O
cord O
and O
essentials O
. O

The O
lapdesk O
is O
much O
better O
than O
just O
holding O
the O
netbook O
in O
your O
lap O
or O
even O
using O
a O
small O
table O
. O

It O
just O
does O
n't O
latch O
properly O
. O

Very O
restricted O
use- O
only O
for O
day O
trips O
when O
i O
do O
n't O
need O
anything O
else O
to O
be O
carried O
. O

Loaded O
up O
, O
it O
gets O
quite O
heavy O
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
it O
on O
your O
back O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
notice O
how O
heavy O
it O
is O
. O

I O
took O
it O
with O
me O
to O
college O
after O
my O
previous O
laptop O
- O
an O
Acer O
Aspire O
- O
failed O
me O
horribly O
. O

With O
the O
above O
said O
, O
I O
have O
a O
few O
thoughts O
specifically O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
ipad2 O
screen O
protector O
. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
workPwr+ O
. O

I O
think O
one O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
my O
Toshiba O
was O
overheating O
because O
I O
have O
checked O

The O
device O
I O
received O
has O
the O
smaller O
notebook O
- O
style O
2-wire O
AC O
cord O
( O
unpolarized O
C7 O
connector O
) O
. O

Windows O
7 O
recognized O
it O
right O
away O

So O
far O
so O
good O
. O

b O
) O
the O
size O
, O
its O
5 O
. O
25 O
in O
X O
3 O
. O
0 O
in O
, O
and O
.75 O
in O
for O
the O
depth O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
my O
2013 O
Nexus O
7 O
. O

Have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
get O
device O
working O
yet O
but O
will O
be O
working O
on O
it O
and O
will O
report O
back O
. O

Nice O
, O
oversized O
screen O
with O
great O
resolution O
. O

The O
extra O
pocket O
holds O
the O
wall O
outlet O
well O
, O
however O
I O
do O
keep O
the O
AC O
adapter O
and O
batteries O
in O
another O
bag O
just O
to O
reduce O
stretching O
and O
wear O

I O
also O
used O
a O
Carry O
Speed O
Uni O
- O
Strap O
/ O
Hand O
Strap O
. O

It O
's O
better O
than O
my O
$ O
80 O
Swiss O
Army O
laptop O
backpack O
. O

I O
had O
a O
cheaper O
IPod O
radio O
that O
stopped O
working O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
. O

Pre O
- O
installed O
software O
stinks O
. O

and O
it O
was O
truly O
worth O
it O
. O

Zippers O
and O
stitchings O
area O
all O
intact O
. O

She O
poked O
around O
it O
a O
bit O
and O
ended O
up O
showing O
me O
how O
the O
interface O
was O
set O
up O
instead O
of O
the O
other O
way O
around O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
if O
you O
want O
a O
tablet O
, O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
good O
one O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
without O
flaws O
. O

The O
other O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
was O
assigned O
to O
my O
notebook O
and O
has O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
traveling O
, O
apparently O
too O
much O
for O
it O
physically O
. O

so O
when O
I O
opened O
the O
pc O
it O
snapped O
the O
outside O
outer O
cover O
off O
) O
. O

will O
buy O
again O
and O
recommend O
. O

The O
sleeve O
worked O
perfect O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
new O
computer O

I O
forget O
about O
this O
review O
:) O

It O
provides O
some O
really O
nice O
bright O
light O
. O

They O
even O
waived O
the O
usual O
shipping O
costs O
( O
probably O
because O
they O
know O
it O
was O
their O
fault O
) O
. O

This O
tripod O
bag O
, O
made O
of O
thick O
durable O
420D O
polyester O
/ O
nylon O
, O
is O
sturdily O
made O
, O
with O
one O
orange O
- O
colored O
rib O
seam O
running O
along O
its O
length O
and O
an O
orange O
- O
colored O
circular O
bottom O
. O

I O
accidentally O
bought O
one O
of O
these O
thinking O
it O
would O
fit O
an O
Intel O
1 O
. O

She O
is O
a O
teacher O
and O
does O
lesson O
plans O
at O
home O
. O

This O
is O
very O
cool O
feature O
for O
me O
. O

Installed O
this O
in O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
from O
2011 O
and O
also O
a O
Mac O
Mini O
. O

Screen O
is O
n't O
that O
vibrant O
, O
kinda O
washed O
out O
looking O
, O

Amazon O
sent O
a O
brand O
new O
replacement O
out O
to O
me O
with O
one O
- O
day O
shipping O
. O

The O
32L O
Backpack O
and O
the O
Climbing O
Pack O
were O
put O
into O
the O
120 O
wire O
cage O
along O
with O
the O
200 O
camera O
bag O
. O

MacBook O
got O
all O
bloated O
and O
fat O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

It O
's O
travelled O
well O
with O
me O
on O
numerous O
trips O
for O
both O
business O
and O
pleasure O
. O

This O
ram O
worked O
flawlessly O
with O
my O
iMac O
extreme O
. O

I O
replaced O
the O
battery O
on O
my O
Compaq O
V6310US O
with O
this O
one O
. O

When O
I O
purchased O
this O
machine O
I O
was O
expecting O
a O
mid O
- O
level O
gaming O
laptop O
. O

I O
was O
never O
able O
to O
get O
my O
laptop O
to O
properly O
recognize O
the O
card O
. O

Except O
they O
did O
n't O
run O
24/7 O
- O
they O
did O
n't O
even O
run O
24 O
! O

At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
it O
is O
fantastic O
for O
playing O
Microsoft O
's O
update O
to O
Mah O
Jong O
tiles O
. O

They O
did O
not O
even O
mention O
or O
provided O
an O
reducer O
adaptor O
, O
another O
Duh O
! O

You O
might O
have O
to O
adjust O
the O
sound O
on O
your O
computer O
and O
get O
the O
best O
sound O
out O
of O
these O
speakers O
but O
overall O
, O
they O
worked O
great O
. O

A O
must O
for O
the O
travelers O
. O

I O
got O
this O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

We O
turn O
down O
the O
lights O
at O
night O
to O
help O
our O
daughter O
go O
to O
sleep O
, O
and O
it O
can O
sometimes O
be O
difficult O
to O
see O
the O
keyboard O
. O

It O
worked O
, O
in O
the O
beginning O
but O
frequently O
disconnected O
and O
missed O
keystrokes O
. O

People O
that O
spend O
more O
than O
a O
few O
dollars O
for O
a O
cable O
, O
any O
cable O
, O
are O
nuts O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
it O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
are O
still O
looking O
around O
, O
I O
would O
note O
that O
HP O
's O
higher O
models O
with O
" O
Beats O
Audio O
" O
are O
n't O
anything O
spectacular O
either O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
to O
often O
. O

The O
pen O
works O
if O
you O
just O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
touch O
your O
screen O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
one O
when O
its O
on O
sale O
. O

so O
when O
i O
got O
the O
screen O

Still O
, O
Best O
Buy O
opened O
at O
nine O
, O
and O
the O
magic O
mouse O
was O
on O
sale O
, O
so O
not O
so O
bad O
. O

I O
did O
however O
, O
have O
to O
make O
a O
small O
box O
to O
house O
the O
cooler O
, O
it O
sits O
halfway O
in O
the O
box O

It O
is O
light O
weightVery O
small O

How O
could O
anyone O
think O
this O
monster O
would O
be O
efficient O
? O

They O
now O
have O
the O
older O
XP O
and O
newer O
machines O
running O
together O
using O
1 O
each O
Keyboard O
, O
Mouse O
, O
Monitor O
, O
and O
speaker O
set O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
great O
, O
it O
provides O
an O
easier O
way O
to O
respond O
to O
emails O
or O
post O
comments O
on O
facebook O
or O
other O
apps O
. O

I O
prefer O
orange O
over O
red O
. O

They O
keys O
are O
easy O
to O
press O
, O
very O
firmly O
attached O
, O
no O
wiggle O
, O
and O
all O
it O
takes O
is O
a O
mild O
press O
on O
each O
key O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
press O
them O
down O
hard O
as O
some O
similar O
keyboards O
I O
've O
used O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
well O
too O
me O
its O
not O
small O
. O

Our O
daughter O
was O
actually O
kissing O
the O
panda O
's O
nose O
when O
she O
saw O
the O
speaker O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
great O
and O
has O
really O
fast O
transfer O
speeds O
on O
my O
Droid O
( O
fits O
snug O
too O
) O

My O
only O
gripe O
is O
that O
it O
should O
include O
a O
Shuffle O
button O
since O
it O
is O
meant O
for O
multimedia O
. O

This O
would O
be O
a O
great O
item O
to O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
as O
it O
's O
small O
and O
, O
shall O
I O
say O
it O
again O
, O
versatile O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
does O
tend O
to O
run O
a O
bit O
warm O
, O
and O
followed O
the O
advise O
of O
previous O
reviewers O
by O
placing O
little O
nobs O
on O
the O
bottom O
so O
that O
the O
air O
can O
circulate O
underneath O
. O

The O
drivers O
work O
in O
MAC O
and O
Windows O
, O
though O
I O
tested O
only O
Windows O
7 O
Professional O
. O

3 O
, O
64 O
bit O
, O
and O
usually O
have O
around O
3 O
- O
4 O
applications O
open O
at O
any O
given O
time O
while O
I O
work O
. O

It O
works O
and O
works O
well O
. O

The O
2 O
- O
3 O
angles O
and O
the O
inner O
strap O
let O
you O
position O
or O
hold O
the O
Tablet O
perfectly O
whether O
it O
's O
on O
a O
desk O
, O
on O
your O
lap O
, O
bed O
, O
etc O
. O

So O
this O
is O
our O
interim O
machine O
until O
retirement O
, O
when O
we O
will O
go O
all O
Mac O
- O
Air O
in O
both O
laptop O
and O
tablet O
formats O
. O

I O
changed O
it O
, O
no O
impact O
. O

Two O
things O
I O
did O
n't O
realise O
how O
much O
I O
liked O
having O
in O
my O
old O
Samsonite O
that O
are O
missing O
in O
this O
bag O
: O
there O
is O
no O
KEY O
HOOK O
, O
and O
no O
partitions O
for O
binders O
, O
notepads O
or O
files O
in O
the O
main O
compartment O
, O
it O
's O
just O
a O
big O
hole O
. O

The O
bottom O
right O
back O
corner O
was O
too O
thick O
so O
when O
I O
would O
open O
and O
close O
the O
laptop O
, O
I O
would O
hear O
this O
creaking O
sound O
like O
an O
old O
wooden O
door O
. O

Wireless O
drops O
occur O
independently O
of O
the O
wireless O
network O
router O
( O
tried O
a O
few O
different O
ones).I O
tried O
uninstalling O
" O
problematic O
" O
Windows O
updates O
, O
enabling O
max O
power O
settings O
for O
wireless O
, O
and O
updating O
to O
the O
newest O
wireless O
driver O
( O
from O
the O
Intel O
website O
via O
their O
detection O
tool O
) O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
an O
audiophile O
or O
even O
someone O
who O
expects O
more O
balanced O
sound O
from O
their O
system O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
keep O
looking O
. O

Samsung O
did O
send O
me O
a O
recovery O
disk O
, O
but O
it O
is O
for O
Windows O
Home O
instead O
of O
Windows O
Professional O
, O
which O
is O
odd O
. O

This O
backpack O
consists O
of O
two O
main O
compartments O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
replacment O
keyboard O
for O
the O
Laptop O
. O

I O
always O
use O
aFisher O
Space O
Penin O
the O
car O
, O
because O
other O
pens O
tend O
to O
stop O
working O
in O
the O
heat O
, O
or O
fail O
to O
write O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

My O
kids O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
think O
something O
you O
can O
just O
browse O
the O
web O
with O
is O
lame O
. O

Paired O
nicely O
. O

I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
this O
product O
because O
the O
Kuzy O
MBA O
case O
I O
purchased O
along O
with O
this O
did O
not O
fit O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

I O
recently O
experienced O
a O
power O
surge O
that O
destroyed O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
electronics O
in O
my O
office O
, O
but O
this O
charger O
is O
still O
going O
! O

It O
's O
intermittent O
, O
and O
possibly O
due O
in O
part O
to O
how O
often O
I O
use O
this O
directly O
on O
my O
lap O
, O
but O
when O
it O
starts O
up O
, O
it O
's O
pretty O
distracting O
and O
often O
able O
to O
be O
heard O
even O
over O
music O
playing O
. O

No O
third O
party O
software O
is O
required O
on O
an O
Andriod O
( O
nor O
on O
an O
Apple O
iPhone O
or O
iPad O
) O
. O

A O
must O
for O
Dell O
mini O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
just O
great.*Performance O
is O
great O
, O
again O
you O
do O
nt O
notice O
until O
you O
try O
another O
laptop O
with O
the O
same O
specs O
, O

but O
I O
have O
perfect O
copies O
on O
my O
hard O
drive O
. O

For O
the O
money O
, O
this O
is O
definitely O
a O
case O
that O
I O
'd O
recommend O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
store O
your O
laptop O
in O
it O
at O
home O
. O

so O
you O
do O
n't O
lose O
one O
of O
your O
ports O
. O

Let O
it O
go O
to O
a O
full O
charge O
/ O
discharge O
for O
three O
times O
. O

This O
basically O
forces O
you O
to O
run O
a O
Desktop O
that O
is O
just O
a O
Desktop O
and O
then O
run O
other O
apps O
in O
their O
own O
Desktop O
space O
. O

whatever O
else O
one O
connects O
to O
the O
USB O
hub O
portion O
of O
the O
Dynadock O
. O

I O
got O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
from O
my O
parents O
for O
Easter O
and O
have O
been O
very O
grateful O
for O
it O
. O

The O
price O
sealed O
the O
deal O
. O

Just O
take O
your O
time O
( O
look O
at O
a O
few O
tutorials O
on O
YouTube O
) O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
're O
grounded O
and O
not O
on O
carpet O
when O
you O
open O
up O
the O
case O
to O
prevent O
harmful O
static O
which O
can O
ruin O
parts O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
a O
6 O
cell O
battery O
for O
my O
little O
Gateway O
netbook O
. O

( O
although O
I O
could O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
if O
I O
bought O
a O
bluetooth O
mouse O
... O
) O

Also O
, O
spend O
the O
time O
to O
remove O
the O
junk O
software O
that O
comes O
pre O
- O
installed O
. O

Works O
great O

The O
monthly O
cost O
is O
enormous O
but O
often O
justified O
by O
savings O
in O
travel O
costs O
( O
if O
you O
say O
so O
) O
. O

I O
was O
provided O
with O
a O
free O
copy O
of O
this O
item O
for O
testing O
and O
my O
fair O
and O
honest O
evaluation O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
usually O
carry O
a O
lot O

: O
-Glitchy O
touch O
pad O

I O
was O
half O
way O
nervous O
about O
ordering O
this O
, O
because O
I O
was O
afraid O
it O
might O
not O
fit O
, O
or O
be O
hard O
to O
put O
on O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
professional O
photographer O
, O
but O
I O
do O
have O
alot O
of O
equipment O
and O
plenty O
of O
camera O
bags O
. O

As O
other O
reviewers O
have O
noted O
, O
the O
lid O
opened O
nicely O
and O
stayed O
where O
I O
set O
it O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
battery O
. O

I O
've O
been O
lazy O
and O
have O
n't O
tried O
dirt O
3 O
, O
which O
came O
free O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Upon O
first O
examination O
the O
design O
is O
simple O
, O
textured O
materials O
that O
give O
a O
sturdy O
feeling O
with O
a O
well O
made O
feeling O
to O
it O
that O
meets O
the O
desired O
need O
of O
toting O
your O
laptop O
around O
in O
a O
sophisticated O
manner O
. O

I O
am O
thrilled O
with O
the O
Flip O
Mino O
. O

Its O
a O
given O
that O
this O
model O
is O
not O
primed O
for O
music O
but O
it O
does O
cover O
the O
basics O
. O

It O
is O
well O
made O
and O
very O
sturdy O
. O

I O
previously O
installed O
Windows O
XP O
and O
it O
was O
so O
much O
slower O
than O
Xandros O
or O
Xubuntu O
, O

My O
2004 O
iBook O
has O
been O
great O
except O
for O
its O
battery O
life O
; O
now O
there O
's O
nothing O
not O
to O
love O
. O

Even O
without O
the O
antenna O
my O
computer O
still O
picks O
up O
my O
own O
router O
. O

Defect O
2 O
: O
Super O
noisy O
fan O
/ O
hot O
box O
: O
when O
you O
turn O
the O
box O
on O
, O
a O
high O
pitched O
load O
fan O
noise O
is O
immediately O
heard O
. O

Both O
Yoga O
's O
had O
the O
same O
drivers O
and O
BIOS O
. O

and O
I O
'd O
have O
it O
within O
a O
week O
. O

For O
kicks O
I O
hooked O
it O
up O
on O
place O
of O
some O
an O
expensive O
rabbit O
ear O
antenna O
on O
my O
office O
TV O
. O

Flawless O
for O
both O
computers O
! O

this O
mouse O
has O
worked O
well O
so O
far O
, O
with O
only O
a O
couple O
exceptions O
. O

so O
I O
could O
easily O
find O
them O
. O

I O
was O
shopping O
around O
, O
wondering O
if O
I O
should O
replace O
my O
broken O
screen O
( O
oops O
, O
totally O
my O
fault O
! O
) O

ca O
n't O
argue O
with O
the O
price O
. O

Video O
looks O
good O
on O
TV O
... O

And O
the O
bag O
has O
structure O
. O

Such O
an O
easy O
solution O
to O
an O
annoying O
problem O
! O

Light O
is O
directional O
, O
but O
covers O
a O
large O
area O
. O

The O
nice O
folks O
at O
Anker O
contacted O
me O
to O
offer O
a O
replacement O
battery O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
if O
you O
just O
take O
time O
to O
make O
the O
right O
adjustments O
and O
use O
the O
tools O
you O
may O
already O
have O
for O
your O
business O
. O

We O
bought O
two O
, O
a O
black O
and O
a O
blue O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
boyfriend O
's O
iPad O
2 O
and O
it O
's O
a O
very O
snug O
fit O
. O

The O
box O
itself O
is O
rather O
bulky O
for O
the O
electronics O
that O
are O
actually O
inside O
it O
. O

The O
rubber O
key O
board O
is O
Ok O
, O
is O
difficult O
to O
type O
with O
it O
. O

The O
clerk O
claimed O
they O
were O
from O
a O
reputable O
company O
( O
I O
think O
Rayovac O
) O
, O
but O
you O
really O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Each O
chained O
speaker O
set O
will O
need O
to O
have O
its O
volume O
changes O
individually O
, O
or O
, O
all O
speakers O
set O
to O
max O
and O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
input O
device O
is O
used O
to O
control O
the O
series O
of O
speakers O
. O

Many O
X202e O
users O
including O
myself O
have O
found O
that O
setting O
the O
brightness O
to O
-20 O
, O
contrast O
to O
51 O
and O
gamma O
to O
0 O
. O
9 O
, O
makes O
for O
richer O
colours O
. O

End O
result O
: O
poor O
connection O
. O

Here O
's O
a O
really O
big O
problem O
no O
one O
else O
has O
mentioned O
. O

You O
would O
n't O
think O
this O
would O
vary O
much O
between O
laptops O
, O
but O
it O
does O
. O

A O
great O
way O
to O
add O
some O
color O
to O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
13&#34 O
; O
it O
is O
rubberized O
and O
grippy O
! O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
with O
an O
iPad O
. O

I O
see O
the O
word O
Garmin O
some O
times O
, O
I O
see O
the O
original O
screen O
sometimes O
. O

Working O
as O
intended O
. O

Nothing O
was O
wrong O
with O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

It O
has O
a O
sleek O
looking O
case O
( O
aluminum O
) O
, O
truly O
great O
red O
backlit O
keyboard O
( O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
used O
) O
, O
and O
red O
accents O
on O
the O
speakers O
( O
which O
sound O
pretty O
good O
for O
a O
notebook O
) O
. O

All O
of O
that O
time O
, O
I O
used O
the O
small O
4x5 O
" O
tablet O
as O
it O
coexisted O
nicely O
on O
my O
desk O
with O
my O
keyboard O
. O

If O
they O
were O
all O
active O
your O
machine O
would O
look O
like O
a O
small O
string O
of O
Christmas O
tree O
lights O
! O

Then O
it O
started O
discharging O
faster O
and O
faster O
. O

I O
travel O
out O
of O
state O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
and O
love O
all O
the O
entertainment O
options O
the O
iPad O
2 O
has O
and O
am O
already O
missing O
those O
apps O
for O
my O
Transformer O
. O

The O
delivery O
from O
Amazon O
was O
very O
quick O
and O
the O
product O
was O
packaged O
with O
care O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
the O
almost O
10 O
' O
of O
cable O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
so O
it O
is O
coiled O
up O
behind O
the O
monitor O
. O

One O
side O
loves O
them O
and O
the O
other O
does O
n't O
understand O
why O
anyone O
would O
give O
a O
Chromebook O
a O
thought O
. O

so O
it O
remains O
thin O
and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
over O
stuff O
. O

Purchased O
this O
as O
a O
replacement O
battery O
for O
one O
that O
stopped O
taking O
a O
charge O
. O

but O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
expected O
in O
a O
box O
this O
small O
. O

Touch O
pad O
. O

To O
review O
the O
Kirabook O
, O
you O
are O
best O
off O
starting O
without O
knowing O
the O
price O
, O
because O
once O
you O
see O
it O
, O
you O
'll O
question O
everything O
about O
this O
machine O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if O
you O
are O
viewing O
a O
black O
image O
, O
movie O
, O
web O
page O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
and O
then O
switch O
to O
something O
white O
, O
the O
screen O
will O
dim O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

Instead O
it O
's O
built O
of O
some O
softer O
and O
less O
sturdier O
nylon O
, O
which O
is O
ok O
. O

Once O
the O
" O
kill O
pad O
" O
was O
unplugged O
from O
my O
laptop O
, O
the O
computer O
returned O
to O
life O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
complete O
restore O

I O

Aunque O

desde O

Another O
one O
arrived O
and O
functioned O
for O
a O
record O
breaking O
9 O
months O
. O

The O
mouse O
can O
be O
comfortably O
palmed O
in O
my O
large O
hand O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
nicely O
into O
a O
pouch O
on O
my O
backpack O
. O

; O
HP O
Envy O
, O
and O
it O
keeps O
my O
notebook O
well O
ventilated O
and O
in O
perfect O
stance O
for O
typing O
on O
the O
keyboard O
. O

Battery O
would O
not O
charge O
at O
all O
. O

Was O
tired O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
smaller O
diskFound O
this O
cheap O
thought O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
tryVery O
happy O
with O
the O
product O

what O
else O
can O
i O
say O
, O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O

I O
got O
the O
IOGEAR O
MediaShair O
for O
Christmas O
2013 O
. O

Surprisingly O
good O
sound O
. O

I O
think O
the O
advantage O
that O
it O
offers O
is O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
accidentally O
right O
click O
as O
much O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
AC O
power O
brick O
needs O
the O
proper O
AC O
plug O
adapter O
attached O
to O
it O
. O

Here O
's O
a O
good O
gauge O
of O
it O
. O

Anyway O
, O
do O
n't O
base O
your O
decision O
on O
the O
ToC O
feature O
either O
way O
. O

This O
tablet O
is O
great O
! O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
about O
2 O
hours O
and O
20 O
minutes O
set O
at O
" O
balanced O
. O

This O
works O
great O
as O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
. O

Repair O
was O
easy O
to O
accomplish O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

So O
far O
it O
works O
fine O
really O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
much O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
noticed O
when O
receiving O
these O
cables O
is O
that O
they O
were O
shipped O
in O
individual O
boxes O
rather O
than O
in O
a O
plastic O
bag O
. O

I O
did O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
purchasing O
this O
backpack O
, O
and O
I O
love O
it O
! O

Repower O
from O
Top O
Power O
.. O

I O
did O
a O
ton O
of O
research O
and O
considered O
several O
other O
laptops O
around O
and O
above O
the O
price O
of O
this O
one O
. O

Now O
I O
feel O
less O
heat O
from O
bottom O
of O
my O
macbook O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
with O
the O
video O
quality O
. O

Of O
all O
it O
's O
bags O
, O
this O
one O
is O
the O
best O
. O

I O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
it O
. O

it O
's O
really O
a O
plug O
- O
in O
and O
forget O
it O
adapter O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O

the O
price O
is O
right O
. O

Very O
simple O
. O
very O
compact O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
someone O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

There O
's O
also O
another O
larger O
pocket O
on O
the O
front O
that O
has O
a O
key O
ring O
for O
your O
keys O
, O
and O
has O
plenty O
of O
room O
to O
hold O
your O
pens O
/ O
pencils O
, O
business O
cards O
, O
and O
smart O
phone O
. O

After O
living O
with O
this O
product O
for O
a O
while O
, O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
you O
're O
better O
off O
finding O
a O
new O
solution O
. O

Texts O
are O
crisp O
, O
screen O
has O
brightness O
adjustments O
and O
it O
is O
BRIGHT O
! O

I O
use O
my O
Kindle O
charger O
to O
recharge O
this O
battery O
. O

Then O
used O
a O
1/8 O
inch O
brass O
, O
flathead O
WOOD O
screw O
to O
mount O
on O
a O
24 O

board O

, O
already O
on O
the O
wall O
next O
to O
my O
desk O
. O

N810 O
is O
slow O
and O
it O
is O
not O
as O
easy O
to O
use O
it O
's O
browser O
as O
it O
is O
advertised O
. O

The O
weight O
is O
good O
, O
as O
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keys O
. O

This O
works O
great O
. O

i O
will O
conduct O
an O
experiment O
whether O
it O
really O
does O
increase O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
charge O
or O
it O
is O
just O
another O
high O
quality O
product O
. O

The O
three O
prong O
connector O
was O
a O
perfect O
and O
snug O
fit O
for O
the O
Dell O
Insprion O
1100 O
and O
the O
materials O
were O
of O
excellent O
quality O
, O
not O
the O
cheap O
made O
in O
China O
stuff O
. O

I O
found O
the O
rotating O
plug O
surprisingly O
handy O
in O
some O
of O
the O
hotels O
we O
stayed O
in O
, O
with O
their O
strangely O
placed O
outlets O
. O

Have O
tried O
uninstalling O
and O
reinstalling O
but O
still O
does O
it O
. O

A O
good O
battery O
in O
great O
packaging O
. O

The O
instructions O
program O
is O
very O
poor O
, O
incomplete O
, O
and O
sketchy O
. O

This O
a O
great O
mouse O
. O

I O
used O
that O
for O
about O
a O
year O
. O

The O
fan O
grill O
is O
made O
of O
aluminum O
, O
while O
the O
handles O
are O
plastic O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
source O
of O
some O
of O
the O
frustrations O
installation O
experienced O
by O
other O
reviewers O
. O

I O
wrote O
a O
negative O
review O
about O
this O
laptop O
on O
the O
company O
's O
website O
but O
they O
denied O
the O
review O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
when O
this O
cord O
has O
finished O
charging O
, O
it O
turns O
itself O
off O
and O
cools O
down O
. O

I O
can O

and O
will O
have O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O

If O
you O
need O

buy O
this O

Returned O

up O

Enjoy O
your O
journey O

this O
fantastic O
machine O
. O

Just O
received O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
. O

there O
is O
no O
question O
: O
these O
displays O
are O
bright O
! O

Following O
a O
close O
inspection O
of O
the O
BoxWave O

I O
originally O
bought O
this O
keyboard O
/ O
stand O
for O
my O
Kindle O
Fire O
, O
but O
unfortunaltely O
I O
did O
not O
read O
the O
entire O
page O
on O
this O
item O
, O
as O
it O
does O
not O
work O
for O
the O
Kindle O
. O

Turn O
the O
display O
and O
computer O
to O
NEVER O
sleep O
and O
the O
fans O
to O
max O
speed O
( O
I O
have O
software O
that O
does O
that O
- O
look O
for O
SMC O
Fan O
Control O
) O
. O

We O
had O
it O
freeze O
up O
on O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
when O
trying O
to O
play O
simple O
games O
on O
PBS O
kids O
. O

but O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
use O
the O
clips O
to O
remove O
the O
filter O
a O
lot O
, O
you O
might O
notice O
the O
difference O
. O

No O
instructions O
came O
with O
the O
recommended O
2 O
G O
upgrade O
, O
but O
if O
you O
just O
spread O
the O
white O
chip O
holders O
apart O
at O
the O
far O
ends O
, O
the O
card O
will O
pop O
up O
. O

This O
surely O
does O
not O
replace O
a O
laptop O
bag O
, O
messenger O
bag O
, O
etc O
because O
if O
it O
's O
lack O
of O
functionality O
and O
limited O
carry O
modes O
. O

but O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
it O
as O
a O
backup O
for O
Internet O
. O

This O
one O
will O
be O
rarely O
used O
that O
that O
absence O
helps O
keep O
it O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

These O
feature O
you O
'll O
find O
on O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
which O
the O
cheapest O
before O
were O
around O
the O
$ O
2k O
range O
. O

However O
the O
battery O
works O
well O
. O
:-) O

Everything O
fits O
nicely O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
compact O
. O

you O
have O
to O
keep O
resetting O
it O
to O
get O
the O
time O
to O
stay O
right O
. O

Nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
except O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
router O
or O
eliminate O
walls O
. O

; O
maybe O
even O
foist O
it O
on O
my O
roommate O
if O
she O
even O
glanced O
at O
it O
. O

It O
even O
supports O
audio O
pass O
- O
thru O
. O

And O
like O
my O
Alienware O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
this O
thing O
is O
pretty O
fast O
. O

No O
faith O
in O
these O
things O
for O
long O
- O

New O

I O
have O
n't O
any O
issues O
to O

Therefore O
, O
nothing O
is O
perfect O
. O

You O
connect O
your O
Asus O
Transformer O
to O
the O
smartphone O
's O
mobile O
wifi O
hotspot O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
do O
not O
like O
about O
this O
mouse O
is O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
receiver O
for O
storage O
it O
is O
on O
the O
bottom O
side O
. O

I O
am O
on O
my O
3rd O
recharge O
/ O
discharge O
cycle O
as O
part O
of O
the O
training O
of O
the O
battery O
so O
I O
will O
update O
later O
if O
problems O
arise O
. O

and O
I O
found O
that O
the O
audio O
volume O
is O
n't O
as O
loud O
as O
i O
'd O
like O
. O

The O
combination O
is O
awesome O
. O

Recently O
however O
I O
purchased O
a O
Foxconn O
A3700 O
book O
- O
sized O
system O
to O
use O
as O
an O
HTPC O
. O

Overall O
I O
do O
find O
it O
to O
be O
an O
amazing O
experience O
under O
OS O
X O

It O
works O
great O
. O

The O
key O
first O
step O
is O
to O
spend O
an O
hour O
trying O
on O
all O
of O
the O
different O
earbuds O
that O
are O
included O
with O
the O
earphones O
. O

The O
teeth O
of O
the O
plug O
stick O
out O
when O
packing O
it O
up O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
they O
retracted O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
I O
felt O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
that O
level O
of O
detail O
, O
but O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
be O
extra O
sure O
, O
because O
I O
was O
surprised O
that O
anyone O
would O
send O
out O
a O
unit O
without O
even O
a O
simple O
check O
. O

great O
response O

That O
's O
the O
holy O
grail O
of O
mobile O
computing O
! O

OTHER O
STUFFA O
huge O
advantage O
over O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
the O
upgradeability O
of O
the O
x220 O
. O

I O
changed O
the O
settings O
per O
their O
recommendations O
and O
now O
the O
battery O
works O
fine O
. O

The O
Velcro O
on O
one O
side O
exposes O
the O
" O
hook O
" O
part O
, O
and O
because O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
cover O
it O
, O
it O
can O
snag O
clothing O
. O

On O
time O
and O
in O
tip O
top O
shape O
. O

Powers O
all O
my O
drives O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
really O
like O
the O
device O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
use O
with O
Webtop O
or O
HTPC O
on O
your O
Droid O
devices O
. O

This O
case O
also O
adds O
a O
lot O
of O
thickness O
and O
weight O
to O
your O
Mac O
. O

" O
Small O
Form O
Factor O
" O
PC O
and O
bent O
the O
metal O
piece O
where O
it O
needed O
to O
be O
cut O
... O

This O
also O
makes O
the O
task O
bar O
easier O
to O
interact O
with O
via O
touch O
, O
especially O
when O
using O
the O
" O
fingers O
behind O
the O
display O
, O

in O

" O
technique O
. O

I O
have O
confidence O
that O
it O
will O
extend O
the O
life O
of O
the O
T61 O
by O
another O
1/2 O
year O
until O
when O
SandyBridge O
i5/i7 O
becomes O
mainstream O
. O

and O
it O
is O
still O
working O
great O
. O

It O
effected O
which O
files O
I O
could O
open O

Keyboard O
too O
small O
for O
male O
hands- O

just O
as O
well O
as O
I O
normally O
can O
-- O
as O
if O
the O
skin O
is O
n't O
even O
there O
. O

This O
case O
was O
not O
designed O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
anything O
goes O
in O
the O
laptop O
section O
but O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
should O
note O
that O
I O
use O
Sling O
on O
a O
Mac O
without O
Sling O
's O
Mac O
software O
( O
it O
's O
in O
Beta O
at O
this O
time O
and O
not O
out O
to O
the O
general O
public O
) O
. O

Do O
n't O
try O
putting O
a O
camera O
in O
it O
with O
a O
battery O
grip O
attached O
though O
- O
the O
bag O
's O
not O
deep O
enough O
at O
the O
" O
top O
" O
end O
it O
wo O
n't O
zipper O
shut O
. O

And O
it O
is O
pratically O
silent O
. O

Do O
n't O
expect O
to O
use O
the O
super O
hybrid O
engine O
... O
also O
crashes O
the O
computer O
. O

Since O
I O
've O
retired O
my O
computer O
needs O
have O
changed O
and O
I O
thought O
a O
net O
book O
could O
be O
a O
good O
fit O
for O
me O
now O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
small O
, O
easy O
to O
carry O
and O
use O
laptop O
to O
supplement O
your O
home O
system O
while O
you O
're O
on O
the O
go O
, O
BUY O
THIS O
ONE O
! O
! O
! O

Take O
one O
of O
the O
big O
lenses O
out O
and O
there O
's O
plenty O
of O
room O
. O

The O
new O
battery O
works O
just O
fine O
and O
the O
fit O
is O
perfect O
. O

and O
then O
all O
the O
family O
members O
can O
just O
dock O
their O
laptops O
when O
they O
want O
to O
use O
a O
full O
size O
computer O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
feel O
real O
proud O
or O
even O
comfortable O
admitting O
my O
shortcomings O
on O
diagnosing O
the O
problems O
I O
had O
, O
here O
in O
public O
. O

The O
low O
end O
is O
the O
most O
disappointing O
, O
with O
only O
modest O
capabilities O
in O
the O
bass O
. O

The O
cable O
often O
did O
n't O
fit O
in O
many O
cases O
that O
I O
had O
for O
my O
phones O
. O

I O
really O
do O
like O
having O
the O
keyboard O
and O
the O
docking O
station O

These O
pockets O
can O
be O
used O
to O
carry O
small O
items O
like O
a O
small O
AC O
adapter O
, O
USB O
cords O
, O
small O
wireless O
laptop O
mouse O
, O
iPod O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
know O
that O
I O
have O
warranty O
, O
but O
to O
send O
a O
laptop O
somewhere O
is O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
for O
me O
... O

My O
other O
original O
charger O
is O
fine O
. O

Fits O
perfectly O
. O

I O
do O
prefer O
to O
drop O
off O
some O
equipment O
like O
the O
laptop O
and O
non O
camera O
equipment O
in O
a O
safe O
locked O
up O
location O
in O
my O
lodgings O
before O
sight O
seeing O
. O

It O
takes O
over O
the O
iPod O
speakers O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
double O
sound O
or O
echo O
. O

The O
first O
relates O
to O
the O
battery O
indicator O
on O
my O
phone O
( O
thing O
that O
tells O
you O
how O
much O

. O

You O
can O

a O

onto O
this O

. O

The O

( O
largly O

this O
in O
hopes O
of O
cooling O
it O
down O
. O

My O
PC O
monitors O
do O
n't O
have O
audio O
support O

That O
is O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
one O
star O
is O
because O
I O
can O
never O
use O
it O
. O

It O
's O
defective O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
try O
and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
get O
a O
replacement O
. O

I O
was O
initially O
concerned O
with O
the O
lower O
resolution O
but O
on O
this O
size O
of O
screen O
it O
works O
well O
and O
my O
wife O
actually O
prefers O
it O
over O
the O
HD O
resolution O
of O
my O
Dell O
as O
it O
makes O
text O
easier O
to O
read O
. O

I O
am O
buying O
my O
wife O
a O
new O
computer O
for O
Christmas O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
a O
PC O
based O
platform O
. O

It O
's O
not O
too O
often O
I O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
a O
review O
, O
but O
this O
little O
gem O
deserves O
one O
. O

If O
it O
is O
moved O
at O
all O
while O
attached O
, O
it O
loses O
connection O
and O
makes O
the O
sound O
when O
you O
unplug O
the O
charger O
. O

I O
also O
found O
the O
padding O
somewhat O
lacking O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
thicker O
and O
stiffer O
than O
other O
cables O
I O
have O
owned O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
have O
kids O
and O
wanted O
to O
protect O
my O
hard O
drive O
from O
them O
. O

You O
can O
comfortably O
place O
the O
laptop O
on O
your O
lap O
when O
doing O
less O
intensive O
work O
( O
net O
surfing O
, O
word O
etc O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
no O
expert O
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
fastest O
booting O
computer O
I O
have O
personally O
ever O
seen O
. O

It O
fits O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
13&#34 O
; O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
with O
my O
Lenovo O
x61 O
- O
-a O
small O
cooling O
pad O
for O
a O
small O

-- O
and O
the O
size O
is O

almost O
got O
it O
right O

In O
addition O
, O
when O
the O
replacement O
arrived O
, O
everything O
was O
perfect O
! O

its O
pretty O
much O
standard O
quality O

I O
for O
instance O
used O
this O
to O
connect O
my O
video O
card O
DVI O
to O
a O
new O
monitor O
that O
excepted O
HDMI O
only O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
is O
the O
cord O
is O
about O
2 O
feet O
shorter O

My O
phone O
( O
iphone O
4 O
) O
was O
great O
for O
hands O

use O
if O
I O
used O
a O
cable O
to O
connect O
the O
headphone O
jack O
to O
the O
car O

and O
relied O
on O
the O
iphone O
mic O
for O
speaking O
--- O
but O
it O
DOES O
NOT O
work O
with O
this O
bluetooth O
device O
. O

For O
photographers O
who O
do O
not O
want O
to O
carry O
a O
camera O
bag O
, O
this O
is O
just O
what O
you O
need O
. O

The O
shoulder O
strap O
has O
adjustable O
length O
and O
wide O
enough O
to O
be O
comfortable O
on O
the O
shoulders O
without O
the O
need O
of O
a O
padding O
. O

This O
product O
keeps O
my O
17&#34 O
; O
laptop O
and O
my O
lap O
cool O
without O
having O
to O
plug O
it O
into O
the O
laptop O
itself O
. O

i O
ca O
n't O
even O
hold O
onto O
Amazon O
when O
i O
am O
trying O
to O
shop O
. O

Chances O
are O
good O
that O
that O
's O
the O
problem O
. O

It O
was O
a O
good O
purchase O
. O

With O
Dell O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
get O
batteries O
that O
work O
the O
first O
time O
and O
last O
for O
an O
acceptable O
time O
. O

You O
have O
to O
turn O
off O
touch O
to O
tap O
because O
it O
is O
too O
sensitive O
and O

Works O
fine O
, O
easy O
to O
configure O
, O
you O
only O
need O
yo O
connecto O
to O
usb O
port O
, O
and O
windows O
7install O
the O
drivers O
autom'aticaly O
, O
recognize O

, O
then O
you O
can O
connect O
your O
devices O
to O
de O
dock O
( O

, O

, O

and O
are O
you O
ready O
to O
use O
it O

The O
memory O
timing O
was O
slightly O
different O
than O
other O
memory O
I O
purchased O
for O
my O
17 O

so O
i O
came O
home O
and O
found O
the O
woman O
's O
case O
here O
on O
amazon O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
needs O
this O
specific O
charger O
. O

I O
was O
initially O
quite O
concerned O
about O
installing O
this O
being O
horribly O
difficult O
but O
surprisingly O
it O
went O
in O
perfectly O
. O

It O
fits O
pretty O
snugly O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
a O
bigger O
laptop O
size O
for O
this O
bag O
. O

I O
had O
it O
for O
about O
4 O
months O
and O
have O
successfully O
backed O
up O
most O
of O
my O
collection O
, O
but O
then O
it O
decided O
not O
to O
play O
or O
read O
Blue O
- O
rays O
anymore O
. O

I O
tried O
formatting O
two O
different O
drives O
: O
an O
HDD O
and O
an O
SSD O
. O

and O
I O
did O
not O
notice O
any O
loose O
threads O
. O

I O
would O
not O
try O
to O
run O
a O
USB O
hard O
drive O
through O
this O
hub O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
but O
not O
so O
slow O
that O
you O
can O
say O
why O
did O
I O
buy O
this O
for O
. O

Worth O
getting O
to O
protect O
your O
tablet O
and O
good O
for O
transporting O

After O
spending O
most O
of O
my O
adult O
life O
messing O
with O
PCs O
and O
working O
in O
the O
industry O
, O
I O
always O
wondered O
how O
the O
Macs O
compared O
to O
the O
PC O
. O

This O
backpack O
was O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Sometimes O
when O
starting O
it O
up O
, O
the O
Tv O
would O
not O
regignize O
the O
signal.-Aspect O
Ratio O
is O
ALLWAYS O
4:3 O
and O
CANNOT O
be O
stretched O
. O

You O
have O
to O
keep O
the O
case O
open O
to O
charge O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
much O
of O
my O
home O
computing O
for O
the O
last O
month O
. O

Better O
than O
cheaper O
or O
smaller O
speakers O

but O
I O
could O
never O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

Manufacturer O
, O
please O
put O
10 O
more O
cents O
into O
these O
things O
and O
fix O
the O
suction O
issues O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
this O
skin O
stays O
flat O
and O
in O
place O
, O
at O
pretty O
much O
any O
angle O
, O
and O
when O
the O
laptop O
is O
closed O
and O
reopened O
, O
even O
though O
my O
screen O
is O
glossy O
. O

My O
best O
suggestion O
is O
to O
just O
fold O
the O
cover O
under O
it O
and O
use O
it O
that O
way O
. O

Programs O
without O
retina O
support O
look O
terrible O
. O

Before O
getting O
this O
, O
I O
had O
been O
using O
those O
microfiber O
cloths O
to O
clean O
my O
iPad O
that O
I O
normally O
use O
to O
clean O
my O
glasses O
. O

i O
m O
satisfied O
with O
this O
thing O
though O

I O
've O
got O
a O
15 O
" O
Macbook O
Pro O
, O
and O
its O
built O
- O
in O
speakers O
sound O
fine O
, O
but O
are O
n't O
very O
loud O
. O

If O
you O
live O
in O
the O
apps O
world O
, O
then O
you O
should O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
this O
operating O
system O
. O

For O
the O
money O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
ask O
for O
moreWe'll O
see O
how O
long O
it O
last O
. O

Amazon O
is O
great O
-- O
they O
gave O
me O
full O
refund O
and O
even O
covered O
the O
return O
postage O
. O

It O
does O
work O
with O
my O
iPhone O
3 O
G O
, O
including O
the O
charging.- O
Improved O
sound O
quality.- O
Battery O
powered O
( O
optional O
) O

It O
does O
work O
though O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
properly O
bright O
and O
the O
speakers O
do O
a O
wonderful O
job O
for O
the O
size O
that O
they O
are O
. O

do O
not O
recommend O
this O
item O
. O

Obviously O
, O
a O
careful O
user O
might O
carry O
a O
few O
empty O
shopping O
bags O
to O
prevent O
spills O
or O
to O
protect O
papers O
on O
a O
wet O
day O
, O
as O
well O
as O
might O
put O
a O
piece O
of O
bubble O
wrap O
on O
the O
bottom O
when O
carrying O
something O
heavy O
and O
fragile O
like O
a O
laptop O
computer O
without O
a O
cover O
or O
books O
to O
protect O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
first O
one O
the O
keyboard O
did O
n't O
work O
from O
the O
start O
. O

For O
what O
it O
's O
worth O
, O
this O
2 O
. O
1 O
system O
sounds O
better O
than O
most O
other O
2 O
. O
1 O
systems O
I O
've O
owned O
. O

I O
think O
the O
display O
is O
VERY O
good O
and O
much O
improved O
over O
my O
last O
macbook O
... O
much O
brighter O
. O

And O
finally O
when O
you O
upgrade O
laptops O
, O
you O
can O
take O
your O
battery O
with O
you O
to O
the O
new O
one O
and O
not O
be O
stuck O
looking O
for O
their O
oddball O
battery O
again O
. O

Looks O
like O
the O
original O
and O
works O
just O
like O
it O
too O
. O

Shipping O
was O
fas O
and O
the O
price O
reasonable O
. O

I O
had O
purchased O
a O
different O
brand O
, O
and O
found O
it O
slowed O
down O
my O
computer O
immensely O
, O
even O
though O
I O
had O
not O
installed O
the O
proprietary O
software O
that O
came O
with O
that O
drive O
. O

Currently O
my O
E1000 O
Cisco O
router O
is O
no O
higher O
than O
eighteen O

This O
means O
for O
me O
the O
space O
remains O
about O
right O
for O
a O
70 O
- O
200 O
2 O
. O
8 O
lens O
but O
can O
not O
be O
further O
divided O
to O
take O
a O
couple O
flashes O
or O
smaller O
lenses O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
very O
impressed O
and O
happy O
with O
what O
it O
can O
do O
. O

With O
the O
huge O
500 O
G O
Hard O
drive O
, O
PLENTY O
of O
room O
for O
pictures O
, O
videos O
and O
downloads O
( O
movies O
, O
games O
.. O
etc O
. O
) O

Blown O
away O
, O
5 O

, O
glad O
I O
sold O
the O
Macbook O
pro O
and O
ultra O
happy O

Finally O
, O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
bag O
to O
" O
sling O
" O
over O
one O
shoulder O
... O
this O
is O
n't O
it O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
check O
to O
see O
if O
your O
device O
supports O
OTG O
. O

I O
will O
note O
here O
that O
the O
on O
- O
board O
graphics O
are O
great O
for O
a O
laptop O
, O
but O
when O
I O
plugged O
in O
the O
HDMI O
to O
the O
big O
screen O
, O
I O
was O
blown O
away O
with O
the O
improvement O
. O

It O
' O
silver O
/ O
white O
color O
, O
which O
I O
love O
it O
, O
and O

I O
really O
love O
my O
replacement O
battery O
. O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
assemble O
and O
configure O
. O

It O
required O
some O
adjusting O
, O
but O
now O
it O
just O
works O
. O

They O
put O
rubberized O
feet O
on O
the O
battery O
to O
prevent O
slipping O
on O
a O
slick O
desk O
which O
is O
a O
great O
addition O
. O

Adds O
just O
a O
little O
extra O
weight O
but O
totally O
worth O
the O
extra O
protection O
. O

I O
always O
buy O
these O
flash O
drives O
mainly O
because O
they O
are O
bulletproof O
reliable O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
Nexus O
7 O
, O
both O
the O
told O
2012 O
( O
gave O
it O
to O
a O
friend O
) O
and O
my O
new O
Nexus O
7 O
2013 O
. O

I O
've O
read O
many O
complaints O
about O
how O
awful O
this O
is O
on O
a O
big O
screen O
TV O
. O

For O
$ O
7 O
it O
's O
a O
solid O
value O
. O

After O
having O
the O
TV O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
add O
the O
following O
. O

I O
have O
3 O
emachine O
D620 O
and O
all O
3 O
of O
the O
original O
batteries O
have O
failed O
will O
not O
hold O
a O
charge O
. O

Yes O
it O
is O
more O
expensive O
. O

this O
one O
is O
10 O
. O
2 O
inches O
wide O
and O
8 O
inches O
deep O
and O
about O
13 O
inches O
on O
the O
diagonal O
. O

Also O
got O
here O
pretty O
quick O
. O

If O
you O
have O
large O
hands O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
good O
mouse O
, O
but O
be O
prepared O
to O
take O
breaks O
, O
or O
adopt O
a O
different O
grip O
, O
or O
otherwise O
do O
something O
to O
accommodate O
the O
slim O
profile O
of O
this O
device O
. O

It O
has O
a O
blackish O
coating O
over O
the O
metal O
. O

This O
product O
was O
recommened O
by O
HP O
when O
I O
asked O
a O
question O
about O
something O
else O
. O

It O
's O
a O
handy O
thing O
to O
have O
to O
clean O
an O
iPad O
off O
with O
, O
without O
having O
to O
spray O
anything O
on O
it O
first O
. O

This O
device O
has O
a O
short O
cable O
, O
but O
that O
's O
a O
plus O
to O
me O
as O
it O
makes O
it O
pack O
smaller O
. O

Getting O
my O
tax O
refund O
check O
in O
the O
mail O
the O
morning O
I O
was O
going O
to O
make O
a O
purchase O
clinched O
the O
deal O
. O

so O
I O
can O
throw O
it O
right O
in O
my O
backpack O
! O

He O
is O
able O
to O
use O
it O
without O
it O
freezing O
. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
my O
spacebar O
squeaks O
. O

So O
I O
have O
one O
good O
one O
and O
one O
bad O
one O
, O
or O
a O
50 O
% O
failure O
rate O
. O

They O
talked O
to O
me O
like O
that O
computer O
geek O
guy O
from O
Mad O
TV O
- O
totally O
talking O
down O
to O
me O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
a O
constant O
long O
term O
connection O
, O
forget O
it O
. O

Bluetooth O
pairing O
works O
great O
- O
just O
follow O
the O
included O
directions O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
dirty O
finger O
prints O
all O
over O
my O
screen O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
from O
an O
offline O
retailer O
for O
a O
similar O
price O
. O

I O
used O
a O
towel O
to O
soak O
up O
the O
squeezed O
out O
water O
to O
prevent O
it O
from O
getting O
into O
the O
computer O
interior O
. O

I O
've O
got O
two O
of O
these O
for O
2 O
different O
netbooks O
, O
and O
they O
've O
been O
serving O
me O
flawlessly O
for O
months O
. O

Also O
for O
( O
not O
frequent O
enough O
! O
) O

Oh O
joy O
! O

The O
fit O
is O
a O
little O
tight O
for O
the O
16 O
" O
laptops O
, O
I O
think O
this O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
zipper O
. O

it O
works O
like O
other O
keyed O
kensington O
microsaver O
locks O
. O

The O
adhesive O
pads O
on O
the O
feet O
came O
off O
after O
about O
two O
months O
and O
the O
feet O
in O
the O
back O
, O
which O
flip O
out O
to O
raise O
it O
up O
and O
give O
the O
computer O
some O
ventilation O
and O
cooling O
cracked O
and O
broke O
off O
after O
a O
year O
. O

older O
laptops O
will O
take O
this O
not O
new O
ones O
. O

One O
option O
is O
to O
spend O
$ O
50 O
for O
a O
USB O
DVD O
drive O
, O
which O
, O
I O
am O
not O
willing O
to O
pay O
. O

I O
will O
try O
ext4 O
when O
it O
is O
more O
stable O
, O
as O
it O
is O
even O
faster O
. O

The O
hinge O
for O
the O
Macbook O
Air O
must O
be O
perfectly O
calibrated O
, O
as O
the O
little O
weight O
that O
this O
case O
adds O
causes O
the O
screen O
to O
fall O
backwards O
or O
fall O
shut O
more O
easily O
than O
usual O
. O

Of O
all O
my O
router O
tested O
this O
is O
FASTEST O
& O
MOST O
STABLE O
. O

I O
initially O
wanted O
to O
use O
it O
to O
print O
picture O
of O
faces O
, O
and O
then O
draw O
from O
it O
, O
but O
the O
size O
is O
just O
too O
small O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
as O
often O
. O

Difficult O
to O
close O
. O

I O
tried O
playing O
around O
with O
my O
computer O
sound O
settings O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
too O
much O
, O
You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
... O

( O
Thanks O
for O
trying O
to O
sell O
us O
an O
over O
- O
sized O
iPod O
Touch O
, O
Steve O
Jobs O
! O
) O

We O
like O
to O
have O
a O
portable O
speaker O
for O
different O
places O
around O
the O
house O
. O

Directions O
were O
found O
online O
for O
the O
install O
, O
not O
to O
hard O
, O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
to O
watch O
out O
for O
and O
not O
touch O
the O
wheel O
itself O
. O

This O
is O
ideal O
for O
me O
, O
though O
I O
could O
enjoy O
a O
12 O
inch O
screen O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
as O
an O
addition O
to O
my O
tablet O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
a O
common O
problem O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
8 O
GB O
, O
and O
it O
was O
obvious O
as O
I O
started O
my O
machine O
that O
it O
was O
performing O
better O
. O

I O
'd O
put O
this O
up O
against O
a O
Monster O
cable O
any O
day-- O
and O
for O
under O
10 O
$ O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
it O
. O

but O
instead O
I O
use O
this O
with O
my O
iMac O
to O
back O
up O
all O
my O
blu O
- O
ray O
movies O
using O
makemkv O
. O

good O
unit O
, O
plenty O
of O
cables O
and O
types O
of O
them O
. O

The O
camera O
is O
adequate O
for O
video O
conferencing O
, O
but O
nothing O
special O
. O

Just O
be O
aware O
that O
changing O
hard O
disks O
is O
not O
so O
easy O
on O
this O
one O
. O

There O
is O
clearly O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
power O
consumption O
or O
charger O
on O
this O
unit O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
trade O
- O
off O
between O
the O
number O
of O
versions O
to O
keep O
and O
space O
utilization O
. O

The O
' O
main O
' O
pocket O
( O
for O
textbooks O
etc O
) O
is O
also O
kinda O
hard O
to O
get O
into O
simply O
because O
there O
's O
a O
flap O
that O
folds O
over O
the O
zipper O
that O
's O
extremely O
stiff O
. O

For O
other O
IEMs O
and O
headphone O
, O
perhaps O
this O
will O
be O
a O
better O
product O
. O

The O
multitouch O
is O
n't O
great O
either O
( O
thought O
it O
had O
zoom O
in O
and O
zoom O
out O
... O

Later O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
mother O
in O
law O
, O
and O
she O
had O
no O
idea O
how O
inexpensive O
it O
was O
for O
me O
. O

I O
got O
11 O
. O
5 O
hours O
on O
first O
full O
day O
of O
usage O
and O
still O
had O
10 O
% O
battery O
left O
when O
I O
shut O
down O
. O

Anybody O
has O
a O
solution O
for O
that O
? O

Needed O
a O
battery O
after O
original O
died O
this O
was O
by O
far O
the O
best O
deal O
seems O
to O
be O
ok O
for O
now O
only O
time O
will O
tell O
if O
it O
was O
a O
good O
investment O
. O

Got O
this O
as O
a O
Christmas O
present O
for O
my O
4 O
year O
old O
daughter O
so O
she O
could O
have O
a O
more O
capable O
tablet O
. O

It O
's O
for O
15&quot O
; O
screen O
laptop O
computers O
and O
swims O
on O
my O
12&quot O
; O
PowerBook O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
ever O
decide O
to O
buy O
it O
, O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
buying O
an O
accidental O
damage O
protection O
, O
which O
adds O
$ O
300-$500 O
to O
the O
price O
depending O
on O
where O
you O
buy O
it O
. O

, O
it O
's O
got O
a O
decent O
3d O
graphics O
card O
, O
it O
's O
got O
USB O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O

This O
time O
I O
went O
looking O
for O
a O
3 O
prong O
replacement O
and O
purchased O
this O
. O

Other O
times O
you O
have O
to O
practically O
lay O
your O
laptop O
on O
top O
of O
the O
router O
. O

and O
I O
expect O
quality O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
get O
quality O
, O
thus O
my O
3 O
star O
rating O
. O

It O
's O
simple O
to O
plug O
in O
, O
and O
is O
flexible O
so O
you O
can O
put O
it O
right O
where O
you O
want O
it O
. O

It O
offers O
more O
protection O
than O
the O
pictures O
suggest O
, O
with O
90%+ O
leather O
covering O
all O
four O
sides O
, O
even O
when O
the O
case O
is O
open O
, O
very O
nice O
. O

The O
laptop O
rests O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bag O
or O
what O
ever O
you O
carry O
inside O
it O
. O

The O
weight O
and O
stiffness O
of O
that O
end O
meant O
that O
the O
single O
skinny O
end O
was O
always O
being O
bent O
back O
and O
forth O
during O
ordinary O
use O
. O

Living O
in O
Ohio O
, O
a O
well O
known O
tree O
state O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
count O
how O
many O
appliances O
I O
have O
lost O
over O
the O
decades O
due O
to O
lightning O
storms O
downing O
trees O
which O
down O
power O
lines O
. O

No O
bluetooth O
or O
wireless O
N O
, O
but O
these O
were O
not O
important O
to O
me O
. O

Windows O
XP O

works O
great O
on O
this O
machine O

is O
snappy O
even O
with O
a O
1 O

and O

. O

I O
know O
this O
is O
not O
my O

because O
I O
already O
checked O
the O
connectors O
for O
cracks O
and O
failures O
in O

, O
I O
persoally O
have O
not O
seen O
them O

the O
difference O
is O
much O
greater O

have O
the O
brightness O
set O
to O
38 O
% O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

I O
had O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
that O
was O
small O
enough O
I O
could O
toss O
it O
in O
my O
back O
- O
pack O
but O
strong O
enough O
that O
I O
could O
easily O
hear O
it O
in O
my O
car O
while O
driving O
down O
the O
highway O
. O

I O
would O
( O
and O
have O
) O
recommend O
this O
item O
and O
would O
absolutely O
buy O
it O
again O
, O
if O
necessary O
. O

This O
is O
also O
INCREDIBLY O
light O
and O
thin O
as O
well O
. O

I O
've O
not O
had O
good O
luck O
with O
Philips O
electronics O
in O
the O
past O
, O
but O
this O
little O
wonder O
put O
those O
fears O
to O
rest O
. O

Right O
now O
, O
I O
am O
down O
to O
4 O
hours O
for O
regular O
work O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
laptop O
to O
not O
only O
keep O
the O
keys O
clean O
but O
also O
because O
I O
love O
how O
it O
feels O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
heat O
is O
not O
an O
unusual O
issue O
for O
a O
compact O
charger O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
it O
feels O
solid O
and O
has O
good O
build O
quality O
. O

This O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
welcome O
addition O
to O
my O
travel O
suitcase O
- O
it O
will O
charge O
any O
of O
my O
computers O
, O
and O
even O
with O
all O
the O
plugs O
takes O
up O
less O
space O
than O
just O
one O
of O
my O
dedicated O
chargers O
. O

but O
i O
've O
seen O

volts O
) O

the O
m1710 O
starts O
first O
and O
is O
ready O
to O
go O
while O
the O
hp O
has O
a O
considerably O
longer O
start O
up O
time O
. O

Many O
people O
have O
gone O
completely O
techie O
, O
but O
for O
my O
husband O
in O
grad O
school O
, O
he O
has O
to O
take O
2 O
or O
3 O
books O
with O
him O
to O
class O
regularly O
. O

Probably O
a O
bad O
driver O
, O
however O
I O
could O
not O
fix O
it O
. O

I O
received O
this O
free O
as O
a O
deal O
from O
New O
Trent O
for O
buying O
another O
product O
, O
it O
's O
an O
amazing O
product O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
these O
speakers O
in O
design O
are O
great O
. O

Seems O
like O
it O
will O
last O
for O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
. O

It O
powered O
right O
up O
, O
no O
issues O
. O

Easier O
to O
replace O
the O
Massive23 O
yearly O
than O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
burned O
out O
laptop O
. O

I O
tried O
several O
fixes O
like O
updating O
the O
driver O
, O
uninstalling O
the O
Intel O
driver O
and O
then O
letting O
Windows O
install O
its O
own O
driver O
. O

Transcend O
claims O
to O
have O
a O
" O
Lifetime O
Warranty O
" O
on O
their O
products O
, O
so O
I O
completed O
an O
RMA O
and O
sent O
off O
the O
card O
. O

It O
simply O
does O
not O
work O
properly O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
add O
programs O
with O
an O
external O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
player O
. O

Will O
update O
further O
when O
I O
know O
more.*EDIT O
October O

, O
2011*Called O
the O
Sony O
Store O
once O
again O
to O
see O
if O
I O
'd O
really O
have O
the O
Vaio O
back O
for O
the O
weekend O
, O
and O
was O
told O
the O
LCD O
panel O
was O
still O
back O
- O
ordered O
! O

Very O
comfortable O
, O
roomy O
, O
professional O
. O

I O
just O
got O
an O
asus O
vivobook O
11 O
. O
6 O
in O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
this O
fits O
it O
perfectly O
. O

No O
complaints O
-- O
sounds O
great O
, O
looks O
cool O
& O
the O
battery O
stays O
charged O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Not O
just O
here O
but O
even O
on O
industry O
sites O
. O

I O
put O
the O
1 O
GB O
HP O
module O
into O
the O
Dell O
and O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
not O
hoping O
for O
anything O
. O

It O
comes O
handy O

As O
for O
tech O
support O
: O
their O
website O
gives O
you O
phone O
numbers O
to O
headquarters O
based O
in O
Taiwan O
or O
China O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
buy O
this O
product O
again O
. O

For O
the O
price O
of O
~$30 O
this O
backpack O
is O
a O
steal O
for O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
carry O
everyday O
essentials O
without O
excessive O
bulk O
. O

When O
I O
pressed O
that O
button O
a O
pretty O
blue O
light O
came O
on O
, O
and O
some O
sounds O
began O
to O
come O
through O
. O

It O
has O
storage O
for O
the O
power O
supply O
and O
other O
accessories O
as O
well O
. O

A O
big O
improvement O
. O

It O
felt O
like O
the O
keyboard O
was O
n't O
solidly O
mounted O
on O
anything O
. O

Volume O
is O
adjusted O
via O
the O
volume O
control O
on O
your O
iPod O
or O
MP3 O
player O
. O

This O
was O
my O
first O
USB O
hub O
I O
have O
owned O
. O

These O
bluetooth O
adapters O
are O
amazing O
and O
easy O
to O
install O
! O

so O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
have O
it O
plugged O
in O
. O

, O
it O
was O
swimming O
in O
the O

Pro O
Light O
backpack O
. O

If O
you O
shop O
around O
you O
can O
find O
it O
for O
$ O
499 O
and O
that O
makes O
it O
a O
real O
bargain O
. O

Paired O
with O
the O
Radeon O
video O
card O
and O

, O
the O
HP O

Photoshop O
, O
CorelDRAW O
, O
AfterShot O
Pro O
, O
and O
your O
other O
favorite O
creative O
software O
programs O
. O

You O
can O
only O
tilt O
the O
screen O
, O
it O
is O
at O
a O
fixed O
height O
. O

Software O
required O
was O
already O
on O
Windows O
7 O
, O
intuitive O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

i O
assume O
that O
this O
is O
in O
part O
because O
of O
windows O
7 O

the O
second O
set O
of O
6 O
cells O
protrudes O
from O
the O
laptop O
bottom O
quite O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
it O
is O
noticeably O
heavier O
. O

Nice O
adapter O
works O
fine O
with O
my O
dLink O
4500 O
router O
, O
gives O
good O
speed O
with O
good O
range O
. O

The O
look O
and O
feel O
is O
very O
boxy O
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
the O
prettiest O
out O
there O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

To O
my O
surprize O
the O
box O
worked O
great O
and O
as O
advertised O
which O
in O
itself O
is O
a O
rarity O
these O
days O
. O

But O
the O
Start O
Menu O
has O
been O
revamped O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
Metro O
tile O
- O
based O
interface O
that O
begs O
to O
be O
used O
as O
a O
touchscreen O
. O

so O
far O
it O
is O
problem O
free O
and O
i O
use O
it O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
. O

Either O
I O
got O
a O
bad O
unit O
or O
the O
other O
reviewers O
have O
not O
heard O
a O
great O
sounding O
tube O
amp O
. O

I O
put O
both O
modules O
in O
directly O
and O
removed O
both O
of O
the O
original O
2 O
GB O
modules O
. O

As O
long O
as O
I O
take O
my O
time O
and O
am O
careful O
, O
I O
really O
like O
using O
this O
backpack O
. O

Going O
with O
the O
6 O
cell O
unit O
literally O
doubled O
the O
battery O
life O
of O
my O
netbook O
, O
and O
props O
up O
the O
little O
computer O
so O
that O
it O
is O
more O
comfortable O
to O
type O
on O
- O
which O
I O
do O
alot O
of O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
a O
small O
notebook O
. O

Good O
signal O
strength O
and O
range O
with O
this O
bluetooth O
adapter O
and O
the O
battery O
allows O
me O
to O
listen O
to O
about O
5 O
hours O
of O
radio O
on O
a O
single O
charge O
. O

Longer O
than O
the O
oem O
cords O
. O

( O
but O
that O
's O
a O
separate O
issue O
! O
) O

Good O
low O
light O
sensitivity O
. O

not O
so O
with O
this O
piece O
of O
junk O
. O

There O
is O
space O
left O
over O
for O
another O
hard O
drive O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
like O
it O
might O
move O
around O
too O
much O
without O
any O
additional O
Velcro O
spacers O
. O

Only O
negative O
I O
have O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
tiny O
bit O
of O
transformer O
hum O
, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
hear O
if O
anyone O
else O
is O
having O
this O
problem O
. O

If O
you O
plug O
this O
thing O
into O
an O
h1/h4n O
, O
DR05/07/40/whatever O
and O
place O
it O
correctly O
, O
you O
'll O
get O
something O
decent O
. O

Pros:-Bought O
a O
usb O

A O

it O
does O

The O
Logitech O

USB O
Speaker O
Z515 O
is O
a O
very O
well O
designed O
device O
. O

It O
's O
light O
weight O
allowed O
me O
to O
easily O
carry O
it O
from O
class O
to O
class O
, O
its O
included O
photo O
and O
video O
editing O
software O
gave O
me O
hours O
of O
productivity O
, O
and O
perhaps O
best O
of O
all O
, O
it O
was O
reliable O
! O

I O
WILL O
report O
back O

I O
spend O

It O
arrived O
well O

well O
for O
over O
two O
months O

with O
its O
MacAlly O
leatherette O
shell O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
a O
little O
thicker O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
battery O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
old O
battery O
in O
a O
friend O
's O
computer O
. O

I O
suspect O
a O
wiring O
issue O
in O
the O
black O
center O
piece O
that O
is O
in O
the O
center O
lost O
a O
connection O

" O
D O
( O
unloaded O
) O
, O
this O
is O
a O
larger O
size O
backpack O
, O
so O
it O
would O
proportionally O
fit O
most O
medium O
to O
large O
men O
well O
, O
but O
it O
might O
look O
large O
on O
smaller O
people O
or O
females O
. O

The O
extra O
plastic O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
sticking O
out O
of O
the O
side O
is O
intended O
for O
balance O
and O
the O
battery O
that O
was O
sent O
to O
me O
was O
designed O
differently O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
basic O
system O
that O
I O
could O
take O
with O
me O
on O
the O
job O
and O
transfer O
video O
from O
an O
SCHC O
card O
to O
a O
hard O
drive O
. O

and O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
noticeably O
warm O
. O

Then O
again O
maybe O
i O
got O
the O
female O
one O
or O
male O
, O
the O
one O
i O
did O
n't O
need O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

Things O
I O
was O
n't O
looking O
for O
but O
are O
great O
bonuses O
to O
have:-Retractable O
speaker O
cable O
. O

It O
is O
nice O
not O
having O
to O
pay O
for O
annual O
McAfee O
or O
Norton O
renewals O
or O
the O
next O
version O
of O
MS O

I O
deal O
with O
quite O
a O
few O

being O
deleted O
by O
kids O
getting O
in O
to O
the O
explore O
window O
on O

I O
was O
debating O
if O
I O
need O
to O
get O
a O
6 O
in O
one O
( O
with O
Cellular O
) O
, O
but O
this O
suits O
my O
requirements O
, O
since O
my O
primary O
connectivity O
needs O
are O
in O
fixed O
locations O
like O
hotels O
and O
over O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
. O

( O
mini O
Hdmi O
the O
screen O
is O
working O
) O

I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
just O
had O
1 O
large O
partition O
as O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
install O
another O
would O
probably O
already O
know O
how O
to O
do O
it O
. O

so O
I O
could O
lay O
it O
down O
rather O
than O
use O
it O
vertically O
- O
maybe O
that O
is O
the O
intended O
use).Use O
: O

I O
plugged O
it O
up O
, O
it O
turned O
on O
, O
put O
in O
the O
password O
to O
my O
WiFi O
, O
it O
updated O
automatically O
. O

I O
bought O
about O
30 O
of O
the O
AA O
and O
AAA O
batteries O
and O
have O
used O
them O
for O
over O
two O
years O
for O
everything O
in O
the O
house O
: O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
and O
keyboard O

I O
've O
often O
bought O

computers O
. O

Also O
the O
case O
is O
simple O
and O
does O
n't O
scream O
" O
I O
'm O
carrying O
a O
valuable O
iPad O
in O
here O
" O
. O

It O
is O
truly O
small O
, O
and O
fits O
very O
easily O
into O
my O
laptop O
case O
. O

wo O
nt O
register O
to O
finger O

and O
other O
gestures O
properly O
. O

The O
device O
was O
useful O
while O
it O
worked O
. O

Just O
be O
careful O
as O
to O
what O
information O
the O
app O
collects O
and O
uses O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
as O
a O
permanent O
solution O
to O
boost O
the O
memory O
capacity O
of O
your O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
. O

The O
true O
magic O
is O
that O
the O
dock O
contains O
a O
secondary O
battery O
that O
gives O
you O
another O
3 O
- O
4 O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
that O
back O
- O
fills O
the O
tablet O
; O
it O
has O
a O
full O
- O
size O
USB O
port O
, O
and O
a O
full O
- O
size O
SD O
card O
slot O
. O

and O
it O
shows O
no O
bad O
after O
memory O
test O
. O

For O
the O
past O
month O
I O
've O
replaced O
my O
work O
laptop O
with O
this O
tablet O
plus O
theLenovo O

Highly O
recomment O
this O
product O
.... O

A O
bit O
snug O
, O
but O
I O
prefer O
it O
that O
way O
. O

However O
the O
static O
issues O
were O
only O
when O
walking O
around O
with O
it O
. O

and O
it O
's O
still O
going O
strong O
. O

Then O
using O
any O
free O
file O
explorer O
program O
( O
available O
from O
android O
market O
) O
you O
just O
select O
the O
file O
and O
install O
on O
your O
Galaxy O
Tab O
( O
from O
your O
Tab).Here O

I O
like O

, O
have O
been O
building O

with O
both O
for O
years O
. O

works O
as O
expected O
, O
keeps O
the O

from O

down O
( O
it O
was O
unbearably O
slow O
with O
the O
stock O
4 O

) O
. O

I O
was O
so O
pleased O
that O
I O

would O

( O
not O
the O

I O
definitely O
would O
recommend O
it O
if O
you O
had O
a O
tablet O
that O
easily O
connected O
with O
the O
keyboard O
's O
USB O
cable O
at O
the O
bottom O
or O
side O
of O
your O

Great O

UPS O
, O
USPS O
and O
FedEx O
are O
all O
have O
so O
many O
packages O
will O
be O
shipped O
every O
day O
, O
all O
of O
these O
shipping O
company O
are O
vastly O
overloaded O
. O

and O
it O
's O
been O
used O
fairly O
regularly O
for O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
or O
so O

My O
dad O
said O
he O
could O
hear O
it O
pretty O
well O
in O
the O
hallway O
outside O
my O
apartment O
when O
he O
was O
coming O
to O
check O
it O
out O
. O

I O
use O
this O
3d O
monitor O
alongside O
my O
27 O
" O
non-3d O
monitor O
but O
it O
holds O
its O
own O
on O
the O
display O
and O
the O
2d O
- O
to-3d O
easy O
button O
is O
still O
my O
favorite O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

To O
recharge O
, O
the O
MX O
Revolution O
must O
be O
set O
on O
a O
docking O
station O
, O
which O
is O
very O
large O
and O
attaches O
to O
a O
USB O
port O
via O
a O
cord O
. O

I O
'll O
keep O
it O
brief O
with O
a O
pros O
and O
cons O
with O
a O
build O
at O
the O
end O
. O

My O
back O
can O
be O
hided O
by O
the O

when O
I O
wear O
it O
. O

Thanks O
amazon O
. O

I O
would O
have O
returned O
it O
but O
hate O
wasting O
time O
and O
just O
ordered O
the O
Logitec O
cooling O

. O

This O
mac O
is O
so O
much O
better O
then O
old O
HP O
computer O
. O

I O
did O
use O
the O
keyboard O
a O
bit O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
well O
so O
far O
; O
although O
I O
have O
not O
used O
all O
the O
functions O
so O
far O
. O

had O
to O
replace O
the O
harness O
with O
a O
local O
tailor O
, O
it O
cost O
more O
than O
the O
bag O
iitself O
! O
! O

Very O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
just O
a O
cable O
connection O
, O
transformer O
and O
the O
pairing O
with O
your O
phone//laptop O

or O
other O

is O
quick O
and O
easy O

this O

just O
calling O

I O
developed O
a O
very O
minor O
issue O
with O
this O
pad O
, O
where O
the O
" O

would O
n't O
always O
work O

Well O
I O
just O
recently O
went O
threw O
this O

clean O
it O
out O
and O
ran O
accross O
this O

I O
love O

I O
can O
place O
my O

atop O
it O
and O
write O
wherever O
I O
want O
to O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
the O
fit O
or O
the O
performance O
, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
drastically O
different O
shape O
than O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
my O
ASUS O
904HA O
. O

I O
swapped O
the O
batteries O
and O
they O
stuck O
out O
the O
same O

I O
ordered O
this O
adapter O
just O
in O

One O
other O
thing O
that O
seems O
odd O
, O
but O
is O
not O
yet O
a O
problem O
, O
is O
that O
the O
top O
edge O
of O
the O
keyboard O
comes O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
glass O
face O
of O
the O
tablet O
when O
it O
's O
all O
closed O
. O

I O
found O
them O
very O
useful O
but O
one O
is O
very O
loose O
and O
when O
carrying O
or O
moving O
the O
macbook O
air O
it O
makes O
a O
annoying O
clicking O
noise O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
with O
a O
DSLR O
for O
my O
wife O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
under O
constant O
heavy O
use O
since O
then O
without O
any O
issues O
in O
performance O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
of O
this O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
look O
into O
some O
things O
. O

Wrapping O
the O
cord O
and O
the O
pouch O
make O
this O
very O
portable O
. O

All O
I O
had O
to O
do O
was O
plug O
it O
in O
, O
and O
win-7 O
took O
care O
of O
the O
rest O
. O

I O
can O
use O
this O
at O
a O
client O
to O
connect O
to O
their O
network O
and O
fix O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
fixed O

It O
seems O
like O
no O
matter O
what O
i O
throw O
in O
this O
thing O
i O
still O
have O
room O
. O

But O
I O
digress O
; O
anyway O
a O
new O
laptop O
was O
needed O
and O
this O
seemed O
a O
good O
replacement O
. O

It O
have O
an O
18 O
month O
warranty O

I O
'd O
already O
upped O
the O
RAM O
on O
that O
one O
as O
far O
as O
I O
could O
go O

I O
would O
refer O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
replace O
their O
factory O
charger O
. O

So O
one O
speakers O
must O
sit O
in O
front O
of O
one O
display O
, O
blocking O
it O
. O

anyone O
else O
had O
the O
same O
question O
: O
When O
playing O
a O
3D O
game O
full O
screen O
, O
does O
it O
use O
its O
own O
video O
card O
drivers O
, O
or O
does O
it O
use O
the O
3D O
Nvidia O
or O
ATI O
drivers O
on O
the O
laptop O
? O

The O
price O
was O
verry O
good O
and O
it O
still O
holds O
a O
good O
long O
charge O
.. O

Using O
this O
second O
card O
solved O
the O
problem O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
happened O
again O
after O
several O
days O
of O
using O
it O
. O

Make O
sure O
to O
check O
your O

dimensions O
before O
purchasing O
to O
make O
sure O
this O
one O
will O
fit O

I O
purchased O
this O
yesterday O
from O
a O
camera O

here O
in O

You O
do O
have O

the O

after O
that O
you O
are O
done O
for O

I O
upgraded O

is O
also O
great O
because O
if O
one O
breaks O
or O
is O
n't O
running O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
, O
you O
still O
get O
some O
cooling O
. O

It O
arrived O
in O
tact O
, O
no O
damage O
was O
done O
by O
it O
having O
to O
travel O
so O
far O
, O
which O
really O
surprise O
me O
. O

This O
is O
already O
2010 O
, O
come O
on O
Logitech O
! O

For O
high O
performance O
mobile O
use O
, O
it O
may O
be O
necessary O
to O
buy O
something O
more O
expensive O
. O

Are O
there O
better O
sounding O
bluetooth O
speakers O
? O

Win7 O
does O
not O
require O
installation O
of O
the O
device O
driver O
; O
it O
is O
supported O
natively O
. O

First O
one O
I O
got O
had O
a O
missing O
part O
in O
the O
color O
display O
. O

Then O
I O
let O
my O
wife O
log O
in O
with O
her O
account O
and O
things O
got O
weird O
. O

I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
Square O
Tradeto O
be O
fixed O
. O

Altogether O
, O
a O
great O
machine O
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
got O
a O
popup O
box O
that O
asked O
me O
to O
put O
in O
the O
Win98 O
CD O
. O

Work O
great O
so O
far O
to O
pay O
my O
music O
. O

After O
you O
upgrade O
the O
cq56 O
to O
a O
max O
of O
8 O
gb O
the O
computer O
runs O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

These O
little O
speakers O
provide O
great O
for O
a O
pc O
without O
taking O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
. O

The O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
version O
9 O
driver O
is O
already O
installed O
on O
the O
notebook O
. O

so O
I O
will O
explain O
a O
few O
things O
. O

I O
like O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
vents O
for O
the O
fans O
to O
blow O
out O
heat O
. O

It O
pulls O
hot O
air O
from O
the O
receiver O
and O
throw O
it O
out O
. O

So O
any O
hints O
of O
greater O
speed O
and O
efficiency O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
world O
's O
smallest O
, O
lightest O
, O
thinnest O
yet O
most O
practical O
computer O
, O
were O
too O
tempting O
to O
resist O
. O

the O
mouse O
scrolls O
very O
smooth O
, O
works O
great O
on O
any O
hard O
surface O
, O
& O
matches O
the O
color O
scheme O
of O
my O
18 O
. O

Turning O
off O
the O
headphones O
got O
Windows O
to O
switch O
back O
to O
the O
speakers O
. O

The O
Power O
ratings O
were O
the O
same O

Hopefully O
this O
review O
will O
help O
some O
of O
you O
in O
the O
search O
for O
the O
latest O
and O
coolest O
laptops O
around O

It O
looks O
so O
beautiful O

The O
dock O
was O
immediately O
recognized O
by O
my O
computer O
( O
DELL O
5800 O
: O
Intel O
Core O
i7 O
- O
2600 O
CPU O
, O
3 O
. O
4 O
GHz O
, O
, O
16 O
GB O
RAM O
) O
and O
the O
reading O
and O
copying O
went O
as O
smooth O
as O
silk O
. O

One O
should O
not O
expect O
to O
touch O
- O
type O
on O
this O
. O

but O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
this O
is O
much O
less O
the O
price O
. O

have O
it O
hanging O
on O
the O
mount O
, O
not O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

I O
can O
see O
the O
" O
internals O
" O
surrounding O
the O
jack O
. O

There O
's O
lots O
of O
pockets O
and O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
customize O
the O
interior O
. O

Worked O
well O
with O
an O
Thinkpad O
T43 O
, O
but O
needed O
a O
female O
- O
female O
VGA O
extension O
cord O
because O
the O
USB O
and O
Audio O
ports O
on O
the O
Thinkpad O
are O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
the O
VGA O
port O
. O

I O
did O
the O
firmware O
upgrade O
and O
it O
stopped O
working O
( O
no O
video O
from O
HDMI O
or O
SVideo O
) O
. O

This O
battery O
was O
a O
surprise O
because O
replacements O
use O
to O
be O
less O
reliable O
in O
my O
experience O
. O

For O
this O
alone O
I O
give O
the O
backpack O
3 O
stars O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
a O
very O
careful O
person O
or O
wo O
n't O
use O
the O
tablet O
/ O
netbook O
sleeve O
at O
all O
, O
then O
this O
backpack O
is O
great O
! O

this O
is O
perfect O
, O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
'm O
on O
my O
laptop O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
it O
's O
on O
my O
lap O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
this O
little O
device O
has O
helped O
to O
make O
that O
time O
spent O
more O
comfortable O
. O

The O
result O
is O
an O
image O
that O
is O
clear O
, O
but O
too O
small O
to O
be O
practical O
. O

the O
plug O
is O
loose O
and O
falls O
out O
easily O
. O

All O
hard O
drives O
CANNOT O
be O
moved O
, O
shocked O
or O
manipulated O
during O
operation O
. O

so O
I O
purchased O
this O
one O
instead O
. O

This O
card O
, O
made O
by O
Ralink O
, O
went O
right O
, O
right O
away O
. O

It O
added O
about O
6 O
to O
8 O
hours O
on O
high O
performance O
mode O
in O
windows O
to O
a O
machine O
with O
6 O
gb O
of O
ram O
and O
a O
Core O
i5 O
processor O
. O

For O
the O
first O
year O
, O
this O
battery O
would O
last O
about O
2hr O
30 O
min O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
Senny O
headset O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

4 O
laptop O
, O
and O
usb O
portable O
HD O
. O

And O
now O
, O
I O
see O
the O
whole O
neighborhoods O
available O
wireless O
routers O
. O

Worse O
, O
the O
keyboard O
became O
intermittent O
, O
as O
did O
the O
mouse O
touchpad O
. O

The O
convenience O
of O
the O
DVR O
off O
- O
sets O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
tuners O
and O
a O
third O
party O
remote O
will O
fix O
the O
second O
problem O
. O

Mine O
is O
black O
13 O
. O

Came O
with O
a O
Keyboard O
USB O
adapter O
that O
fits O
perfectly O
( O
worth O
as O
much O
as O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
case O
) O

With O
the O
Lapdesk O
he O
can O
use O
his O
laptop O
as O
long O
as O
he O
wants O
or O
needs O
to O
without O
the O
discomfort O
of O
hot O
legs O
. O

No O
lag O
and O
shows O
nice O
pressure O
sensitivity O
. O

But O
this O
seems O
like O
a O
good O
- O
enough O
product O
, O
considering O
that O
limitation O
. O

The O
item O
was O
shipped O
from O
California O
on O
Monday O
and O
I O
received O
it O
in O
Florida O
on O
Friday O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
turn O
the O
blue O
tooth O
on O
and O
NFR O
. O

This O
Belkin O
USB O
Port O
is O
a O
good O
and O
true O
2 O
. O
0 O

I O
run O
a O
coretemp O
app O
to O
track O
temperatures O
on O
my O
T7200 O
chip O
and O
have O
observed O
a O
10 O
- O
15 O
degree O
C O
drop O
while O
using O
the O
Cooler O
Master O
U3 O
. O

It O
did O
not O
work O
at O
the O
first O
attempt O
, O
and O
it O
took O
me O
a O
couple O
minutes O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
4-pin O
power O
connector O
has O
been O
inserted O
180 O
opposite O
, O
which O
turns O
out O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
do O
with O
this O
unit O
. O

This O
is O
excellent O
return O
for O
my O
investment O
. O

The O
larger O
battery O
gives O
a O
3/4 O
inch O
extension O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
computer O
, O
making O
it O
far O
easier O
to O
pick O
up O
and O
hold O
. O

And O
Windows O
8 O
is O
n't O
that O
bad O

And O
always O
do O
so O
at O
Amazon O
-- O
I O
have O
n't O
found O
a O
better O
price O
and O
there O
's O
zero O
difference O
in O
the O
coverage O
you O
get O
. O

Overall O
good O
review O
. O

It O
fits O
exactly O
my O
17&#34 O
; O
Sony O
Vaio O
PCG-8112L O
, O
and O
provides O
almost O
1 O
. O
5 O
hr O
use O
time O
, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
the O
one O
hour O
I O
expected O
, O
however O
, O
the O
actual O
time O
depends O
heavily O
on O
what O
the O
system O
is O
doing O
. O

I O
'll O
adjust O
to O
the O
minimal O
discrepancies O
. O

So O
this O
is O
not O
for O
casual O
use O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

You O
will O
need O
to O
use O
an O
equalizer O
to O
coax O
sufficient O
bass O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
to O
knock O
the O
midrange O
down O
a O
bit O
( O
midrange O
sounds O
" O
cheap O
" O
on O
a O
flat O
equalizer O
) O
. O

Might O
want O
to O
get O
some O
of O
those O
now O
just O
in O
case O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
I O
have O
typically O
used O
a O
standard O
- O
sized O
soft O
briefcase O
with O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
, O
and O
it O
's O
always O
so O
heavy O
and O
crammed O
full O
that O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
carry O
. O

Which O
is O
freaking O
unbelievable O
. O

It O
accommodates O
a O
hydration O
system O
of O
your O
choice4 O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
watching O
a O
movie O
, O
you O
really O
do O
experience O
surround O
sound O
- O
like O
reach O
. O

one O
Vista O
and O
one O
Windows O
7 O
- O
and O
use O
the O
Media O
Center O
software O
for O
tv O
programing O
, O
recording O
etc O
- O
of O
course O
with O
this O
antenna O
only O
limited O
broadcasts O
are O
available O

I O
love O
this O
thing O
and O
plan O
to O
buy O
another O
shortly O
to O
have O
one O
for O
work O
and O
one O
for O
home O
. O

However O
, O
I O
still O
prefer O
a O
hands O
- O
free O
method O
of O
communication O
myself O
, O
vs. O
holding O
a O
device O
like O
the O
Moshi O
Moshi O
Curve O
up O
to O
my O
ear O
. O

I O
THINK O
I O
JUMPED O
ON O
THIS O

so O
I O
actually O
have O
a O
spare O
DVI O
- O
to O
- O
HDMI O
cable O
. O

The O
Media O
link O
HomePlug O
seemed O
to O
have O
performed O
as O
advertised O
. O

The O
speaker O
head O
looks O
indestructable O
. O

I O
was O
concerned O
perhaps O
that O
13 O
" O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
large O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
do O
much O
work O
on O
. O

which O
means O
it O
takes O
a O
tiny O
fraction O
of O
the O
power O
of O
traditional O
bluetooth O
devices O
. O

I O
love O
the O
compact O
size O
of O
it O
great O
to O
leave O
in O
my O
bag O
for O
travel O
, O
cleans O
up O
the O
mess O
of O
cords O
in O
my O
bag O
! O

For O
practical O
reasons O
I O
'd O
rather O
prefer O
the O
black O
body O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
power O
my O
laptop O
just O
as O
the O
OEM O
pack O
did O
in O
the O
beginning O
; O
lasting O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
standard O
use O
. O

The O
price O
is O
great O
for O
the O
specs O
you O
get O
. O

I O
finally O
ran O
the O
USB O
cable O
BETWEEN O
the O
fan O
and O
the O
laptop O
, O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
work O
out O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
happen O
would O
be O
AsusTek O
releasing O
a O
GTX O
680 O
M O
4 O
GB O
powered O
G75VW O

Speed O
seems O
about O
the O
same O
, O
too O
, O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
done O
any O
tests O
. O

As O
it O
is O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
protect O
your O
computer O
if O
you O
set O
it O
down O
a O
little O
too O
hard O

It O
actually O
is O
n't O
bad O
once O
you O
get O
it O
configured O
... O
but O
that O
is O
the O
thing O
, O
you O
have O
to O
configure O
it O
. O

I O
also O
wanted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
customize O
my O
tablet O
more O
and O
have O
more O
options O
in O
terms O
rooting O
. O

I O
could O
easily O
lounge O
one O
the O
coach O
or O
bed O
and O
still O
use O
my O
mouse O
. O

They O
are O
located O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
short O
edges O
, O
not O
on O
the O
rear O
like O
my O
other O
tablets.>IE O
browser O
works O
WAY O
better O
than O
any O
iOS O
or O
Android O
browser O
. O

Put O
a O
web O
address O
and O
wait O
. O

If O
you O
do O
nt O
mind O
being O
the O
same O
size O
as O
your O
laptop O
, O
i O
recommend O
this O
. O

Pros:-You O
can O
basically O
ignore O
the O
app O
screen O
and O
download O
the O
full O
programs O
instead O
of O
using O
the O
apps.-There O

four O
different O
sets O
of O

thanks O
to O
the O
comments O
here O
, O
i O
was O
encouraged O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

Since O
it O
was O
the O
same O
size O
as O
the O
laptop O
, O
it O
fit O
in O
the O
case O
with O
the O
laptop O
, O

My O
laptop O
fits O
snugly O
inside O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
scuffs O
or O
other O
damages O
from O
books O
in O
my O
bag O
, O
or O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
rain O
ruining O
it O
, O
if O
I O
get O
caught O
off O
guard O
. O

All O
the O
screws O
appear O
to O
be O
phillips O
now O
, O
so O
I O
wo O
n't O
need O
my O
T8 O
driver O
anymore O
. O

But O
I O
feel O
like O
the O
expandable O

baffle O
construction O
is O
fragile O
and O
may O
not O
last O
long O
over O
time O
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
post O
an O
update O
if O
things O
change O

When O
people O
say O
that O
about O
stuff O
in O
reviews O
, O
I O
usually O
say O
" O
So O
what?"In O

I O
can O
only O
get O
about O

get O
300 O
speed O
on O
my O
upstairs O
compter O
. O

But O
if O
and O
when O
you O
get O
it O
installed O
, O
it O
does O
work O
reliably O
as O
advertised O
. O

The O
battery O
was O
immediately O
recognized O
by O
the O
computer O
without O
having O
to O
do O
anything O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
little O
mouse O
! O

The O
laptop O
detected O
the O
hub O
, O
but O
had O
very O
few O
of O
the O
components O
working O
. O

Sure O
we O
get O
lucky O
sometimes O
but O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
cheap O
gear O
I O
have O
learned O
one O
fast O
and O
hard O
lesson- O

The O
Pocket O
PC O
OS O
and O
the O
Windows O
CE O
OS O
are O
both O
VERY O
flawed O
, O
and O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
software O
that O
's O
on O
there O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
is O
Microsoft O
, O
including O
Outlook O
Express O
, O
which O
has O
a O
VERY O
high O
security O
risk O
and O
has O
a O
very O
bad O
reputation O
. O

I O
had O
periodically O
priced O
batteries O
around O
and O
although O
the O
computer O
works O
fine O
and O
I O
intend O
on O
keeping O
it O

the O
bottom O
and O
top O
did O
not O
fit O
well O
, O
to O
open O
and O
close O
the O
top O
part O
of O
my O
macbook O

but O
I O
was O
really O
multitasking O
! O
! O
! O

so O
you O
can O
use O
the O
keyboard O
with O
a O
computer O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
built O
in O
Bluetooth O
. O

, O
my O
mouse O
was O
either O
dead O
or O
very O
erratic O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
seagate O
sshd O
as O
a O
replacement O
hard O
drive O
for O
my O
acer O
intel O
i3 O
laptop O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
price O
for O
a O
great O
product O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
Windows O
8 O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
else O
out O
there O
that O
I O
saw O
or O
handled O
for O
under O
$ O
75 O
that O
rocked O
me O
like O
this O
one O
. O

but O
it O
DID O
exceed O
what O
I O
needed O
it O
to O
do O
. O

And O
my O
designers O
tell O
me O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first O
MacBook O
they O
can O
design O
on O
in O
terms O
of O
display O
correctness O
- O
previous O
models O
did O
n't O
really O
live O
up O
to O
their O
standards O
for O
that O
, O
and O
they O
'd O
have O
to O
double O
- O
check O
designs O
on O
their O
desktops O
. O

i O
use O
it O
for O
my O
sirius O
radio O
because O
plugging O
headphones O
straight O
to O
the O
back O
the O
volume O
is O
to O
low O
. O

This O
system O
is O
great O
. O

Ten O
months O
later O
we O
have O
noticed O
one O
thing O
- O
when O
the O
battery O
indicator O
says O
it O
is O
time O
to O
plug O
the O
thing O
in O
, O
the O
laptop O
does O
n't O
go O
dead O
before O
we O
have O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
plug O
it O
in O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
sending O
it O
back O
. O

The O
cord O
has O
a O
more O
than O
sufficient O
length O
to O
it O
to O
allow O
for O
the O
pack O
to O
be O
stowed O
out O
of O
sight O
or O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

AudioIt O
's O
OK O
. O

it O
works!(using O
a O
My O
Touch O
4 O
G O
Smartphone O
from O
T O
- O
Mobile O
) O

The O
seals O
on O
the O
box O
appeared O
to O
be O
& O
# O
34;restuck&#34 O
; O
to O
the O
box O
and O
the O
were O
scuffs O
on O
the O
box O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
own O
Toshiba O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
. O

As O
for O
this O
Logitech O
lapdesk O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
product O
being O
light O
enough O
to O
be O
used O
as O
a O
comfortable O
lapdesk O
for O
long O
periods O
. O

The O
newer O
laptop O
thin O
model O
is O
not O
much O
better O
than O
a O
regular O
hard O
drive O
. O

The O
new O
battery O
outer O
cover O
color O
is O
slightly O
off O
and O
does O
n't O
match O
the O
color O
perfectly O
like O
the O
previous O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
product O
goes O
downhill O
from O
there O
... O

First O
I O
'm O
quite O
sure O
that O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
going O
back O
to O
PC O
, O
second O
I O
" O
upgraded O
" O
from O
the O
MacBook O
and O
yes O
this O
Mac O
is O
hotter O

The O
space O
bar O
should O
have O
been O
engineered O
with O
this O
in O
mind O
though O
. O

The O
speed O
of O
the O
laptop O
is O
now O
lightening O
fast O
. O

It O
works O
well O
with O
Windows O
Media O
Center O
allowing O
me O
to O
record O
two O
different O
programs O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Zippered O
pouch O
on O
front O
will O
fit O
the O
power O
adapter O
( O
similarly O
to O
the O
way O
Speedos O
fit O
) O
. O

but O
once O
I O
reset O
it O
it O
worked O
great O
. O

I O
've O
had O
the O
Surface O
RT O
since O
it O
was O
first O
released O
, O
and O
purchased O
it O
with O
the O
original O
Touch O
Cover O
. O

It O
seems O
comparable O
to O
the O
560 O
gtx O
in O
my O
desktop O
. O

Physically O
I O
turn O
it O
over O
and O
find O
the O
default O
OEM O
battery O
near O
exploded O
and O
the O
outer O
shell O
ruptured O
. O

This O
suits O
a O
gadget O
- O
heavy O
student O
or O
traveler O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
day O
pack O
for O
a O
trek O
. O

A O
Type O
- O
A O
USB O
3 O
is O
only O
used O
to O
hook O
this O
to O
your O
USB O
3-enabled O
tablet O
. O

This O
compact O
lighted O
, O
powered O
USB O
hub O
has O
been O
very O
reliable O
. O

If O
you O
turn O
off O
wifi O
and O
bluetooth O
you O
get O
an O
increase O
to O
about O
9 O
. O
5 O
hrs O
of O
normal O
usage O
. O

it O
's O
color O
, O
after O
minimal O
use O
. O

I O
have O
to O
drop O
a O
star O
because O
the O
authentic O
apple O
charger O
is O
flawed O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

The O
adjustable O
strap O
is O
sturdy O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
hold O
up O
well O
with O
use O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
padded O
so O
I O
will O
not O
pack O
the O
case O
too O
heavy O
if O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
carried O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
you O
have O
use O
the O
cloud O
to O
write O
your O
papers O
. O

Honestly O
I O
chose O
Komputerbay O
brand O
because O
this O
16 O
GB O
set O
was O
so O
cheap O
. O

If O
you O
want O
your O
laptop O
PC O
to O
double O
as O
a O
serious O
entertainment O
center O
, O
however O
, O
you O
still O
need O
to O
get O
some O
desk O
or O
tabletop O
speakers O
. O

This O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

No O
problems O
and O
worked O
as O
described O
, O
just O
like O
a O
new O
one O
! O

This O
battery O
held O
even O
less O
charge O
than O
my O
old O
one O
. O

I O
have O
had O
about O
10 O
different O
tablets O
over O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
will O
update O
this O
further O
after O
I O
've O
the O
bag O
for O
a O
longer O
time O
. O

To O
test O
range O
, O
I O
set O
in O
my O
vehicle O
, O
about O
3 O
blocks O
away O
from O
Village O
inn O
. O

Computer O
is O
noticeably O
faster O
after O
this O
upgrade O
from O
the O
pre O
- O
installed O
8 O
GB O
of O
Apple O
Hynix O
RAM O
. O

This O
arrived O
on O
time O
and O
was O
packed O

Like O
every O
time O
. O

Especially O
When O
Dropped O
! O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
I O
need O
a O
battery O
that O
lasted O
over O
2 O
hours O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
kids O
to O
use O
for O
homework O
and O
playing O
games O
( O
so O
that O
they O
would O
n't O
keep O
downloading O
crapware O
onto O
MY O
laptop O
! O
) O
. O

When O
the O
cable O
arrived O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
as O
many O
described O
, O
with O
one O
lead O
having O
a O
pin O
removed O
and O
the O
other O
having O
a O
white O
sticker O
. O

For O
those O
devices O
, O
I O
use O
a O
different O
externally O
powered O
USB O
hub O
. O

So O
, O
they O
take O
up O
too O
much O
space O
for O
what O
they O
are O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
've O
grasped O
the O
concept O
of O
Windows O
8 O
, O
I O
'm O
blazing O
through O
all O
of O
my O
software O
/ O
applications O
faster O
than O
a O
bat O
out O
of O
hell O
. O

75 O
- O
although O
snug O
it O
would O
have O
worked O

First O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
because O
it O
says O
that O
it O
uses O
Bluetooth O
3 O
. O
0 O
in O
the O
6GHz O
range O
. O

The O
price O
on O
this O
is O
now O
around O
$ O
100 O
or O
less O
, O
so O

In O
reality O
, O
this O
is O
a O
frustrating O
gadget O
at O
best O
. O

Silly O
, O
silly O
- O
but O
it O
's O
whatever O
. O

I O
was O
hoping O
for O
plug O
and O
play O
. O

Flashing O
LED O
when O
transfers O
occuring O

Good O
simple O
case O
. O

They O
'll O
also O
ignore O
your O
emails O
, O
as O
well O
as O
refuse O
to O
list O
any O
contact O
information O
( O
no O
telephone O
, O
no O
HQ O
email O
, O
anything O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anybody O
that O
uses O
GNU O
/ O
Linux O
and/or O
is O
on O
a O
budget O
regarding O
computer O
parts O
. O

This O
makes O
it O
an O
excellent O
choice O
for O
those O
that O
do O
n't O
have O
USB O
ports O
to O
spare O
. O

Amazon O
contacted O
me O
and O
refunded O
my O
money O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
poor O
, O
and O
the O
fan O
noise O
is O
a O
dealbreaker O
. O

So O
this O
simple O
, O
minimally O
designed O
pad O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
useful O
accessories O
I O
own O
. O

I O
'm O
hard O
to O
please O
with O
a O
backpack O
. O

Overall O
a O
great O
choice O
, O
a O
little O
pricey O
but O
worth O
it O
. O

Having O
just O
moved O
from O
Windows O
to O
Mac O

Lastly O
, O
the O
labels O
come O
with O
instructions O
to O
make O
printing O
from O
an O
inkjet O
or O
laser O
printer O
simple O
. O

The O
people O
on O
the O
other O
end O
say O
the O
image O
looks O
great O
. O

( O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
generally O
a O
trackpad O
hater).WHEN O
USING O

The O
bag O
's O
ability O
to O
carry O
everything O
I O
need O
is O
the O
best O
feature O
yet O
. O

Do O
n't O
throw O
away O
the O
cap O
for O
the O
plug O
; O
it O
doubles O
as O
a O
support O
when O
the O
unit O
is O
plugged O
into O
the O
wall O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
zune O
HD O
because O
$ O
80 O
. O
00 O
for O
a O
car O
dock O
is O
a O
joke O
. O

So O
I O
went O
back O
to O
doing O
my O
hoomework O
and O
settled O
on O
this O
even O
though O
there O
were O
some O
iffy O
reviews O
. O

Fits O
tightly O
around O
the O
edges O
... O

I O
have O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
this O
fits O
perfectly O
and O
is O
a O
nice O
sleeve O
to O
use O
when O
putting O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
backpack O
or O
bag O
to O
travel O
. O

Worked O
perfectly O
during O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Australia O
and O
layover O
in O
Fiji O
. O

YOU O
DO O
NOT O
NEED O
TO O
INSTALL O
THE O
CLIENT O
MANAGER O
TO O
USE O

However O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
for O
the O
money O
and O

I O
obviously O
made O
a O
bad O
choice O
. O

The O
little O
things O
are O
what O
make O
this O
product O
, O
the O
variable O
angle O
tilt O
, O
the O
cutout O
on O
the O
front O
for O
you O
to O
use O
the O
headphone O
and O
microphone O
jacks O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
laptop O
itself O
. O

It O
is O
either O
up O
or O
down O
, O
and O
I O
prefer O
down O
. O

This O
black O
Macbook O
is O
everything O
I O
could O
ever O
want O
in O
a O
computer O
. O

Direct O
replacement O
for O
the O
keyboard O
my O
4 O
YO O
shorted O
out O
. O

Plugged O
it O
in O
and O
openelec O
recognizes O
it O
and O
my O
wifi O
. O

No O
zipper O
issues O
, O
no O
fraying O
fabric O
, O
nothing O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
maybe O
25 O
times O
. O

I O
found O
that O
and O
more O
in O
the O
Eee O
PC O
. O

ASUS O
has O
some O
rules O
about O
swapping O
parts O

I O
had O
the O
one O
before O
this O
one O
and O
love O
this O
one O
much O
better O
as O
it O
attaches O
to O
my O
computer O
and O
makes O
it O
feel O
like O
it O
is O
a O
part O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

The O
tips O
are O
not O
as O
flimsy O
as O
the O
previous O
model O
. O

This O
means O
the O
" O
green O
" O
setting O
will O
start O
or O
media O
player O
will O
pop O
up O
, O
etc O
. O

Bends O
easily O
into O
any O
position O
desired O
and O
the O
light O
is O
plenty O
bright O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

Have O
n't O
EVER O
been O
able O
to O
get O
this O
to O
work O
. O

So O
this O
is O
not O
going O
to O
make O
me O
leave O
my O
Mac O
in O
the O
dust O
, O
but O
it O
is O
fun O
. O

Actiontec O
seems O
to O
have O
acknowledged O
this O
design O
flaw O
by O
supplying O
you O
with O
a O
small O
USB O
extension O
cable O
. O

I O
am O
delighted O
with O
this O
case O
! O

We O
have O
several O
computers O
on O
our O
household O
LAN O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
them O
use O
this O
webcam O
. O

This O
mouse O
is O
still O
in O
its O
package O
. O

Some O
systems O
can O
make O
sense O
of O
this O
and O
recognize O
two O
different O
LUNs O
as O
two O
different O
physical O
drives O
. O

Plugged O
it O
in O
and O
instantly O
recognized O
in O
Windows O
7 O
. O

I O
'm O
an O
IT O
major O
and O
the O
old O
netbook O
just O
was O
n't O
cutting O
it O
anymore O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
case O
for O
my O
Asus O
tranformer O
. O

so O
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
those O
who O
need O
a O
replacement O
power O
supply O
for O
their O
laptops O
or O
just O
one O
that O
is O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
than O
their O
original O
one O
. O

I O
would O
definiately O
buy O
this O
again O
. O

Have O
had O
it O
for O
over O
two O
years O
, O
no O
problems O
whatsoever O
. O

She O
also O
sounded O
like O
, O
at O
times O
, O
that O
she O
was O
in O
an O
enclosure O
instead O
of O
outside O
! O
! O

It O
does O
have O
a O
humming O
noise O
that O
is O
noticeable O
when O
you O
are O
near O
the O
speakers O
. O

I O
called O
my O
mother O
the O
other O
night O
, O
and O
we O
spoke O
for O
about O
5 O
hours O
straight O
. O

Light O
turned O
blue O
I O
removed O
it O
from O
laptop O
. O

So O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
trying O
to O
find O
another O
one O
since O
this O
one O
has O
lots O
of O
issues O
with O
the O
bluetooth O
technology O
in O
it O
. O

Well O
made O
and O
fits O
my O
iPad O
Air O
perfectly O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
sleep O
feature O
that O
after O
non O
use O
dims O
the O
LCD O
's O
and O
then O
turns O
them O
off O
which O
is O
another O
well O
thought O
of O
feature O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
: O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
HP O
dv7t-7200 O
. O

You O
could O
still O
hear O
it O
plugging O
away O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
next O
to O
its O
bigger O
brother O
speaker O
system O
. O

The O
description O
claims O
that O
this O
is O
for O
laptops O
up O
to O
17 O
" O
, O
but O
I O
would O
definitely O
not O
use O
it O
on O
anything O
larger O
than O
15".Fourth O
, O
it O
is O
very O
lightweight O
; O
much O
lighter O
than O
the O
NC2000 O
. O

My O
Kindle O
Fire O
stays O
in O
tightly O
( O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
work O
to O
get O
the O
corners O
in O
) O
with O
the O
rubberized O
and O
elastic O
corner O
straps O
. O

Desktops O
take O
care O
of O
' O
computer O
killer O
' O
heat O
easier O
. O

Very O
nice O
design O
. O

There O
is O
no O
support O
for O
this O
issue O
on O
either O
the O
Logitech O
or O
Skype O
sites O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
the O
problem O
lies O
. O

This O
probably O
wo O
nt O
be O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
people O
. O

The O
finish O
is O
very O
scratch O
resistant O
( O
I O
have O
n't O
managed O
to O
scratch O
it O
in O
three O
months O
of O
heavy O
everyday O
use O
, O
and O
my O
matte O
black O
Inspiron O
looked O
terrible O
in O
the O
same O

I O
liked O
it O
a O
lot O
. O

Your O
PC O
, O
iPhone O
, O
iPod O
, O
iPad O
, O
Tablets O
Or O
MP3 O
Player O

But O
I O
was O
expecting O
a O
named O
brand O
like O
Incase O
to O
have O
better O
manufacturing O
quality O
control O
than O
this O
. O

one O
within O
two O
months O
. O

The O
drivers O
were O
automatically O
installed O
from O
a O
non O
- O
Microsoft O
resource O
via O
5 O
minute O
long O
secondary O
process O
. O

Does O
n't O
hold O
a O
charge O
. O

One O
feature O
that O
needs O
improvement O
is O
HDMI O
connectivity O
to O
external O
monitors O
and O
TV O
. O

and O
it O
definitely O
improves O
the O
usefulness O
of O
the O
tablet O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

The O
audio O
and O
ethernet O
pass O
through O
seems O
to O
be O
alright O
. O

This O
has O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
niciest O
backpacks O
I O
have O
ever O
bought O
, O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
now O
I O
own O
2 O
of O
these O
, O
very O
high O
quality O
, O
not O
a O
Toy O
. O

This O
could O
be O
a O
slightly O
fiddly O
unit O
or O
could O
be O
my O
lack O
of O
experience O
. O

Startup O
is O
a O
breeze O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
HP O
. O

The O
result O
was O
perfect O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
also O
necessary O
to O
account O
for O
the O
touchscreen O
components O
and O
it O
offers O
the O
side O
benefit O
of O
making O
the O
device O
big O
enough O
to O
feature O
a O
full O
- O
sized O
keyboard O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
go O
with O
something O
smaller O
and O
more O
cramped O
. O

Powerful O
, O
love O
the O
feel O
and O
looks O
of O
the O
lighted O
keyboard O
, O
great O
looking O
screen O
, O
very O
snappy O
with O
the O
8 O
GB O
SSD O
cache O
, O
very O
quiet O
.... O
even O
under O
full O
load O
of O
gaming O
, O
built O
in O
speakers O

The O
lack O
of O
exterior O
side O
pockets O
was O
a O
pain O
. O

After O
buying O
the O
cheapest O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
I O
& O
# O
34;upgraded&#34 O
; O
to O
this O
headset O
and O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
. O

and O
I O
just O
had O
to O
buy O
this O
cable O
, O
plug O
it O
in O
, O
and O
voila O
! O

i O
did O
n't O
go O
that O
route O
! O

Would O
I O
recommend O
or O
purchase O
this O
product O
again O
? O

My O
first O
pair O
of O
batteries O
went O
out O
one O
year O
later O
( O
to O
the O
month O
, O
not O
the O
day O
) O
. O

5 O
screws O
and O
less O
than O
a O
hour O
later O
I O
was O
done O
... O

( O
I O
have O
a O
Mac O
Mini O
in O
the O
office O
and O
a O
Mac O
Pro O
at O
home O
) O
. O

That O
's O
better O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
cheap O
electronics O
these O
days O
. O

It O
was O
not O
a O
messenger O
bag O
or O
any O
kind O
of O
bag O
, O
but O
it O
is O
pretty O
! O

Excellent O
, O
used O
by O
our O
son O
at O
school O
, O
protects O
Chrome O
book O
and O
does O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
use O
of O
the O
tablet O
. O

There O
are O
two O
mounting O
options O
for O
Macbook O
Air O
11-inch O
. O

and O
it O
was O
constantly O
being O
moved O
and O
pulled O
on O
. O

CPU O
Passmark O
Score O
: O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
have O
determined O
that O
the O
hub O
interferes O
with O
the O
machine O
's O
ability O
to O
start O
up O
and O
shut O
down O
. O

I O
contemplated O
my O
options O
which O
included O
reconfiguring O
my O
on O
- O
board O
wireless O
internet O
or O
buying O
a O
separate O
network O
card O
and O
disabling O
the O
on O
- O
board O
chip O
. O

If O
it O
does O
for O
other O
people O
, O
then O
it O
can O
bend O
out O
of O
the O
way O
or O
you O
can O
take O
the O
mic O
out O
! O

The O
modern O
, O
contemporary O
design O
is O
pleasing O
to O
me O
. O

If O
they O
make O
it O
so O
the O
quality O
when O
you O
transfer O
the O
video O
to O
your O
computer O
is O
as O
good O
as O
hitting O
play O
on O
your O
camera O
and O
linking O
it O
directly O
to O
your O
tv O
with O
hdmi O
the O
camera O
would O
definitely O
be O
better O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
same O
quality O
in O
the O
raw O
data O
for O
some O
reason O
when O
its O
transferred O
from O
the O
camera O
to O
your O
computer O
. O

and O
it O
's O
just O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
first O

This O
is O
really O
bad O
! O

Other O
times O
it O
'll O
be O
too O
loud O
. O

This O
backpack O
was O
made O
for O
the O
part O
- O
time O
adventure O
traveler O
who O
likes O
to O
pack O
light O
and O
move O
fast O
. O

But O
overall O
it O
is O
great O
. O

The O
power O
supply O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
I O
LOVE O
the O
modular O
power O
attachments O
. O

My O
model O
is O
the O
1 O
. O
86 O
GHz O
, O
2 O
GB O
RAM O
, O
128 O
SSD O
used O
with O
a O
Speck O
Cranberry O
Speck O
See O
- O
Thru O
case O
-- O
it O
fits O
my O
portability O
needs O
perfectly O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
mention O
is O
that O
Samsung O
has O
some O
features O
that O
they O
advertise O
as O
cutting O
edge O
, O
which O
I O
really O
question O
. O

I O
used O
this O
card O
for O
photos O
and O
video O
in O
my O
Kodak O
z1285 O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
without O
any O
problems O
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
1 O
. O
1 O
USB O
port O
cable O
for O
backwards O
compatibilities O
. O

Plus O
I O
have O
a O
thick O
file O
containing O
all O
rules O
and O
information O
to O
run O
the O
proprietary O
PC O
program O
I O
have O
to O
operate O
. O

It O
has O
the O
right O
screen O
size O
( O
keeping O
fairly O
thin O
too O
) O
, O
good O
pen O
support O
, O
good O
amount O
of O
ports O
including O
full O
usb O
. O

It O
is O
very O
comfortable O
to O
view O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
any O
different O
from O
viewing O
my O
old O
14 O
inch O
LCD O
. O

Spotlight O
has O
none O
of O
these O
problems O
. O

This O
is O
a O
perfect O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
small O
footprint O
, O
long O
battery O
life O
( O
4 O
+ O
hours O
) O
notebook O
for O
me O
. O

is O
to O
un O
- O
google O
yourself O
. O

This O
is O
not O
bad O
for O
twenty O
bucks O
just O
do O
n't O
expect O
too O
much O
! O

I O
was O
afraid O
that O
the O
envelope O
style O
would O
make O
it O
more O
bulky O
than O
necessary O
but O
that O
is O
not O
an O
issue O
, O
it O
is O
fairly O
slim O
. O

However O
, O
RAM O
4 O
GB O
is O
quite O
small O
with O
this O
version O
. O

Also O
the O
packaging O
claims O
that O
there O
are O
two O
different O
fan O
speeds O
, O
there O
is O
not O
. O

I O
customized O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

While O
this O
is O
not O
a O
dig O
against O
this O
particular O
model O
, O
it O
is O
a O
problem O
inherent O
with O
a O
Mac O
if O
your O
not O
booting O
up O
2 O
OS O
's O
. O

I O
plugged O
all O
the O
stuff O
( O
KVM O
) O

Programs O
for O
it O
do O
not O
seem O
to O
work O
, O
and O
if O
you O
do O
get O
it O
to O
work O
... O

On O
checking O
with O
Asus O
tech O
support O
via O
Email O
, O
I O
was O
advised O
to O
fix O
that O
by O
updating O
the O
BIOS O
( O
currently O
version O
0602 O
) O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
updated O
BIOS O
for O
the O
1000/Linux O
offered O
yet O
as O
of O
today O
on O
the O
Asus O
download O
site O
. O

It O
is O
a O
known O
issue O
for O
several O
years O
. O

Ran O
a O
hmdl O
cable O
around O
the O
wall O
to O
use O
mouse O
. O

but O
that O
's O
$ O
100 O
and O
for O
portable O
use O
its O
perfect O
. O

Too O
bad O
its O
does O
not O
come O
with O
eraser O
as O
well O
but O
there O
is O
always O
a O
trade O
- O
off O
paid O
for O
the O
comfort O
you O
get O
. O

Under O
Windows O
7 O
the O
drivers O
installed O
themselves O
fine O
. O

The O
charger O
comes O
with O
a O
sufficiently O
long O
cable O
. O

This O
case O
is O
perfect O
size O
for O
my O
kid O
's O
laptop O
and O
his O
few O
hand O
held O
gaming O
devices O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

Great O
price O

I O
called O
places O
in O
New O
York O
. O

This O
was O
a O
very O
cheap O
solution O
to O
bring O
it O
back O
to O
life O
. O

Highest O
I O
've O
seen O
it O
hit O
is O
around O
68C O
which O
is O
n't O
too O
bad O
though O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
about O
the O
design O
of O
this O
product O
when O
I O
purchased O
it O
on O
Amazon O
is O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
second O
short O
handle O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
notice O
it O
not O
being O
listed O
on O
the O
product O
specs O
. O

That O
time O
would O
be O
at O
the O
dimmest O
screen O
, O
with O
the O
wireless O
shut O
off O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
fastest O
speed O
or O
the O
biggest O
memory O
, O
but O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
Toshiba O
, O
for O
this O
price O
, O
has O
made O
a O
good O
lap O
top O
. O

I O
usually O
download O
the O
latest O
drivers O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
website O
anyways O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
KVM O
switch O
for O
about O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
. O

Love O
this O
shell O
case O
. O

I O
tried O
so O
many O
things O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O
that O
I O
lost O
track O
of O
what O
finally O
surprised O
me O
and O
made O
it O
work O
. O

Having O
now O
used O
the O
speaker O
for O
awhile O
, O
let O
me O
assure O
you O
that O
it O
has O
more O
than O
met O
my O
expectations O
and O
it O
is O
a O
product O
I O
highly O
recommend O
if O
you O
have O
an O
interest O
in O
a O
portable O
bluetooth O
speaker O
. O

My O
speakers O
came O
with O
rubber O
feet O
, O
and O
rubber O
covers O
on O
the O
fold O
out O
stands O
. O

Just O
treat O
it O
like O
gold O
and O
it O
will O
be O
good O
to O
you O
! O

Since O
they O
are O
so O
close O
in O
age O
, O
they O
are O
only O
1 O
size O
apart O
in O
the O
clothing O
department O
. O

A O
great O
product O
for O
travelers O
. O

Even O
running O
just O
the O
stock O
2 O
gb O
of O
ram O
, O
the O
laptop O
is O
very O
speedy O
( O
I O
plan O
on O
upgrading O
soon O
tho O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
necessary O
yet O
. O
) O

I O
fiddled O
with O
it O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
then O
tried O
them O
on O
my O
netbook O
( O
which O
is O
what O
they O
were O
purchased O
for O
) O
and O
it O
found O
them O
right O
away O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
add O
surge O
protection O
to O
a O
single O
outlet O
, O
along O
with O
have O
a O
USB O
charger O
capability O
from O
the O
same O
outlet O
( O
one O
that O
should O
charge O
an O
iPhone O
or O
later O
Android O
) O
, O
this O
is O
perfect O
. O

Battery O
sucks O

This O
is O
more O
important O
than O
it O
might O
seem O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
amazing O
for O
such O
a O
small O
and O
stylized O
product O
. O

and O
I O
could O
not O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

adapter O
would O
not O
even O
connect O
to O
another O
Medialink O
Blue O
Tooth O
4 O
. O
0 O

Windows O
HiDPI O
support O
is O
inconsistent O
outside O
of O
the O
' O
Modern O
' O
interface O
. O

I O
'd O
qualify O
it O
as O
average O
. O

it O
adds O
more O
usb O
2 O
ports O
. O

at O
least O
you O
know O
that O
you O
can O
go O
to O
Amazon O
and O
buy O
the O
replacement O
for O
1/2 O
or O
less O
than O
the O
original O
. O

But O
she O
sure O
enjoys O
that O
bluetooth O
to O
phone O
connection O
in O
her O
car O
. O

Quality O
is O
extremely O
bad O
.. O

fit O
if O
you O
put O
the O
netbook O
in O
the O
sleeve O
that O
came O
with O
ASUS O
. O

This O
allowed O
me O
to O
use O
BT O
4 O
LE O
apps O
on O
my O
iPhone O
4S O
as O
well O
as O
more O
than O
double O
the O
range O
of O
myLG O
HBS-730 O
Bluetooth O
Headphones O
! O

Now O
for O
the O
pros O
, O
much O
of O
which O
I O
've O
heard O
complaints O
about O

With O
the O
starting O
configuration O
my O

obtained O

following O

This O
adapter O
had O
absolutely O
no O
problems O
setting O
up O
the O

on O

There O
is O
a O

works O

The O

is O

also O
magnetic O

so O
that O
I O
spent O

.... O

I O
chose O
the O
backpack O
rather O
than O
a O
hard O
case O
because O
I O
'm O
usually O
hiking O
somewhere O
to O
get O
to O
where O
I O
want O
to O
shoot O
. O

Product O
does O
n't O
have O
any O
flaws O
like O
the O
original O
that O
came O
with O
the O
Asus O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
too O
concerned O
with O
padding O
. O

So O
we O
opened O
another O
unit O
/ O
laptop O
and O
then O
another O
. O

I O
figured O
that O
if O
the O
part O
did O
n't O
work O
out O
I O
could O
leverage O
Amazon O
's O
policies O
to O
protect O
myself O
and O
recoup O
the O
investment O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
lens O
holders O
( O
see O
photos O
) O
are O
all O
open O
, O
meaning O
that O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
for O
the O
lenses O
to O
slip O
out O
of O
position O
or O
, O
if O
you O
open O
the O
bag O
the O
wrong O
way O
, O
fall O
out O
or O
slip O
. O

and O
I O
like O
that O
, O
as O
a O
person O
who O
likes O
using O
the O
electronic O
while O
it O
charges O
, O
this O
one O
barely O
moves O
or O
gets O
remove O
, O

they O
over O
solved O
it O
with O
this O
machine O
. O

Not O
a O
huge O
deal O
, O
but O
somewhat O
annoying O
. O

so O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
issues O
with O
the O
wifi O
, O

Haven;t O
noticed O
issues O
with O
battery O
life O
yet O
but O
expectation O
from O
other O
keyboards O
are O
about O
2 O
weeks O
to O
a O
month O
depending O
on O
use O
. O

It O
is O
sufficient O
, O
but O
not O
snappy O
or O
quick O
. O

case O
does O
not O
snap O
on O
into O
place O
all O
the O
way O
on O
any O
part O
of O
the O
laptop O
there O
is O
no O
point O
in O
having O
a O
case O
that O
does O
not O
fit O
the O
computer O
. O

So O
it O
is O
n't O
as O
durable O
as O
I O
'd O
hoped O
, O
but O
the O
low O
price O
helps O
soothe O
the O
pain O
. O

It O
's O
1/2 O
pound O
heavier O
than O
the O
Chromebook O
and O
battery O
life O
is O
30 O
% O
shorter O
than O
the O
Chromebook O
. O

Bought O
this O
and O
Monoprice O
BT O
Transmitter O
and O
the O
two O
are O
working O
well O
together O
to O
send O
audio O
from O
my O
ceiling O
mounted O
projector O
to O
my O
HTS O
. O

This O
fits O
the O
UV-5r O
perfectly O

Gets O
warm O
underneath O
as O
many O
have O
mentioned O
, O
but O
MUCH O
less O
of O
an O
issue O
than O
I O
expected O
! O

The O
price O
seems O
to O
fluctuate O
quite O
a O
bit O
so O
do O
n't O
get O
in O
a O
hurry O

That O
's O
the O
way O
all O
tech O
should O
be O
, O
imo O
. O

Not O
made O
of O
& O
# O
34;iron&#34 O
; O
but O
not O
fragile O
either O
. O

The O
cable O
worked O
without O
any O
issues O
( O
as O
expected).I O
would O
recommend O
this O
cable O
to O
anyone O
who O
needs O
a O
nice O
long O
cable O
on O
the O
cheap O
. O

99 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
the O
Chromebook O
suits O
my O
needs O

I O
purchased O
mine O
directly O
from O
Lenovo O
because O
they O
were O
sold O
out O
on O
Amazon O
at O
the O
time O

I O
wanted O
a O
product O
that O
I O
could O
use O
to O
se O
my O
DAW O
's O
on O
my O
HDTV O
. O

The O
unit O
is O
well O
made O
which O
also O
makes O
it O
slightly O
top O
heavy O
and O
therefore O
sort O
of O
leans O
out O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

Combined O
with O
a O
generous O
500 O
GB O
conventional O
hard O
drive O
, O
this O
computer O
has O
a O
great O
mix O
of O
speed O
and O
capacity O

The O
only O
lights O
on O
it O
are O
Power O
and O
Microphone O
Muted O

The O
speaker O
paired O
easily O
with O

and O

This O
is O
basically O
as O
functional O
as O
a O

at O

I O
would O
imagine O
that O

might O
not O
have O

also O
bought O

for O

more O

to O
my O

After O
four O

for O

promised O
to O
send O
me O
a O

, O
they O
promptly O
sent O
the O
_ O
same O
_ O
unit O
back O
to O
me O
, O
without O
explanation O
. O

The O
zippered O

can O
be O
used O
for O
this O

is O
a O
little O
awkward O
as O

much O
that O
this O

is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O

it O
worked O
for O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
rubberized O

but O
this O
one O
is O
just O
plastic O
. O

I O
did O
not O
plug O
and O
replug O
this O
at O
all O
to O
cause O
this O

I O
ran O

this O
item O

January O
02 O
, O
2011I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
item O
for O
a O
year O
now O
. O

Works O
like O
I O
thought O
. O

They O
are O
expensive O
compared O
to O
the O
competition O
, O
but O
their O
stitch O
, O
zipper O
, O
and O
materials O
quality O
makes O
that O
worthwhile O
. O

It O
's O
very O
fluid O
in O
motion O
and O
fast O
enough O
. O

My O
wife O
, O
who O
's O
not O
a O
gadget O
person O
, O
just O
ordered O
one O
of O
these O
for O
herself O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
this O
case O
, O
but O
I O
only O
wish O
that O
it O
was O
for O
the O
white O
mac O
. O

With O
proper O
interfaces O
, O
everything O
I O
could O
need O
. O

Boot O
and O
shut O
- O
down O
time O
is O
significantly O
reduced O
. O

Very O
dense O
foam O
surrounds O
the O
computer O
and O
certainly O
gives O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
is O
really O
protecting O
the O
computer O
- O
although O
I O
have O
n't O
done O
a O
drop O
test O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

Note O
that O
I O
have O
no O
idle O
timers O
set O
on O
my O
PC O
, O
it O
is O
on O
full O
- O
bore O
all O
the O
time O
until O
I O
manually O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

I O
could O
do O
without O
all O
the O
extra O
adware O
stuff O
on O
it O
though O
. O

Sorry O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
but O
at O
least O
amazon O
was O
good O
about O
the O
return O
. O

I O
am O
100 O
% O
satisfied O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
carry O
my O
Ipad O
, O
two O
kindles O
, O
and O
my O
cell O
phone O
in O
the O
rearmost O
pocket O
. O

It O
's O
cool O
that O
these O
are O
offered O
in O
different O
colors O
so O
you O
can O
identify O
your O
gear O
without O
opening O
the O
wrap O
. O

Probably O
wo O
n't O
use O
them O
again O
, O

The O
metal O
is O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
its O
pretty O
well O
organized O
, O
tough O
, O
solid O
, O
and O
quiet O
. O

The O
speaker O
system O
does O
have O
very O
good O
sound O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
did O
n't O
stick O
out O
like O
a O
sore O
- O
thumb O
or O
a O
bad O
looking O
dongle O
. O

Given O
the O
scratch O
resistance O
of O
ipads O
, O
that O
approach O
is O
far O
sufficient O
, O
and O
this O
product O
only O
introduces O
another O
thing O
you O
'd O
carry O
around O
- O
not O
needed O
. O

my O
daughter O
hated O
it O
due O
to O
size O
and O
that O
she O
had O
to O
plug O
in O
a O
dongle O
.... O

The O
dye O
of O
the O
red O
leather O
is O
n't O
fade O
- O
proof O
, O
and O
can O
transfer O
color O
to O
other O
things O
if O
it O
gets O
wet O
and O
sits O
on O
them O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
, O
for O
me O
, O
this O
incompatibility O
is O
annoying O
, O
especially O
as O
I O
set O
up O
the O
new O
Mac O
Pro O
and O
have O
to O
frequently O
reboot O
for O
installing O
new O
software O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
comfort O
and O
style O
, O
the O
Logitech O
takes O
the O
prize O
. O

I O
prefer O
the O
logitech O
keyboard O
but O
the O
logitech O
case O
did O
not O
last O
long O
for O
me O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
using O
that O
keyboard O
with O
this O
folio O
cover O
. O

So O
the O
usable O
storage O
space O
in O
this O
case O
will O
be O
465 O
GB O
or O
93 O
% O
. O

Very O
solid O
product O
that O
never O
gives O
me O
grief O
. O

The O
bottom O
has O
sharp O
edges O
that O
can O
scratch O
your O
wrists O
and O
should O
have O
been O
smoothed O
over O
when O
they O
made O
it O
. O

Still O
overall O
, O
with O
it O
having O
two O
speakers O
, O
I O
expected O
a O
little O
better O
. O

and O
I O
have O
to O
tinker O
with O
it O
( O
with O
the O
computer O
plugged O
in O
) O
- O

I O
simply O
insert O
a O
thumb O
drive O
and O
either O
record O
a O
live O
TV O
show O
or O
transfer O
a O
pre O
- O
recorded O
show O
from O
my O
DVR O
. O

The O
manufacturer O
's O
description O
indicates O
that O
this O
bag O
will O
fit O
most O
15 O
" O
laptops O
, O
however O
, O
it O
does O
fit O
my O
17 O

Other O
slight O
problem O
is O
it O
will O
not O
work O
with O
satellite O
, O

The O
connectors O
feel O
solid O
. O

I O
have O
an O

34;N&#34 O
; O
router O
and O
expected O
this O
baby O
to O
give O
me O
a O
fast O
connection O
, O
but O
nothing O
I O
did O
helped O
, O
and O
I O
spent O
a O
few O
hours O
at O
it O
. O

I O
looked O
online O
to O
see O
if O
there O
was O
a O
fix O
. O

Very O
good O
experience O
. O

I O
got O
this O
cable O
and O
a O
Mediabridge O
charger O
to O
replace O
what O

Update O
7/24:After O
trying O
Toshiba O
support O
( O
useless O
, O
do O
n't O
bother O
as O
they O
do O
not O
support O
this O
item O
; O
it O
is O
a O

brand O
) O
and O
going O
on O
a O
crusade O
through O
forums O
on O
Toshiba O
and O
DisplayLink O
Web O
Sites O
( O
which O
had O
an O
unacceptable O
amount O
of O

You O
can O
have O

remote O
volume O
control O
even O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O

It O
also O
fits O
well O
behind O
my O
legs O
, O
up O
against O
the O
front O
- O
bottom O
of O
my O
seat O
for O
easy O
access O
. O

I O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
an O
alarm O
clock O
that O
plays O

for O
the O
alarm O
, O
and O
there O
is O
really O
nothing O

out O

that O
seems O
worthwhile O
. O

The O
noise O

The O

to O
be O
an O
exact O
replacement O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
enough O
to O
quickly O
remove O
the O
phone O
. O

but O
so O
far O
it O
has O
not O
been O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

For O
most O
normal O
business O
programs O
, O
this O
really O
works O
well O
. O

and O
overall O
the O
price O
was O
very O
reasonable O
. O

If O
I O
had O
a O
CD O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
needed O
the O
drive O
, O

I O
tried O
it O
and O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

I O
will O
update O
this O
review O
when O
and O
if O
they O
can O
fix O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
the O
pins O
and O
they O
were O
bent O

this O

I O
was O

getting O

my O

for O

and O
are O
worth O
the O
$ O

in O
my O
opinion O
. O

After O
trying O
to O
fix O
it O
twice O
and O
re O
- O
imaging O
my O
whole O
computer O
, O
the O
problem O

Because O
from O

I O
could O
only O
hear O

I O
was O
provided O
with O
a O
sample O
of O
this O
product O
in O
exchange O
for O
an O
honest O
review O
. O

10X O

is O
a O
little O
slim O
for O
my O
liking O

The O

looks O
bigger O
than O
it O
is O
, O
I O
could O
barely O
stuff O
in O
2 O
days O
' O
worth O
of O
clothing O
, O
and O
a O
light O
jacket O
, O
and O
I O
do O
pack O
light O
, O
if O
I O
utilize O
some O
of O
the O
laptop O
space O
I O
could O
probably O
get O
another O
pair O
of O
cloths O
, O

Bought O
this O
thinking O
it O
was O
NEW O
. O

In O
one O
word O
.... O
Exceptional O
. O
I O
was O
never O
happy O
with O
the O
battery O
that O
came O
with O
my O
Acer O
Aspire O
One O
A110 O
9 O
cell O
battery O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
no O
fan O
of O
any O
electronic O
equipment O
being O
hard O
- O
wired O

Out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
set O
up O
in O
mere O
minutes O
with O
my O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
Tab2 O
10 O
. O
1 O
. O

If O
I O
were O
a O
normal O
user O
, O
given O
the O
price O
and O
the O
promise O
, O
I O
would O
have O
probably O
given O
up O
and O
either O
tossed O
it O
in O
the O
trash O
or O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

All O
of O
the O
LCD O
panels O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
look O
better O
after O
being O
" O
burned O
in O

As O
I O
did O
not O
intend O
portable O
use O
as O
important O
I O
presume O
the O
relatively O
short O
battery O
time O
would O
be O
its O
major O
drawback O
for O
those O
who O
need O
laptops O
in O
business O
. O

so O
now O
I O
only O
use O
it O
as O
something O
to O
keep O
my O
laptop O
on O
minus O
the O
fan O
. O

But O
the O
quality O
of O
music O
it O
puts O
out O
to O
my O
headset O
is O
terrible O
. O

I O
am O
a O
techi O
little O
geeky O
person O
, O
so O
I O
know O
a O
little O
more O
or O
at O
least O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

It O
is O
not O
as O
convenience O
when O
I O
change O
channel O
. O

It O
saves O
much O
space O
inside O
my O
smaller O
laptop O
bag O
. O

Although O
I O
have O
Roku O
devices O
that O
support O
HBO O
Go O
, O
Comcast O
still O
does O
not O
allow O
its O
HBO O
subscribers O
to O
view O
HBO O
Go O
through O
the O
Roku O
systems O
. O

Its O
not O
neon O
, O
or O
brightly O
colored O
, O
or O
see O
through O
, O
like O
some O
other O
models O
, O
but O
it O
looks O
just O
fine O
to O
me O

It O
really O
saved O
us O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
time O
. O

I O
recommend O
Targus O
CVR217 O
and O
Lowepro O
Tropolis O
1700 O
as O
I O
own O
them O
to O
carry O
it O

At O
nearly O
three O
times O
the O
price O
of O
my O
old O
Targus O
though O
, O
and O
the O
balance O
issue O
, O
I O
have O
to O
deduct O
a O
star O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
and O
have O
not O
faced O
any O
problem O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

i O
got O
it O
because O
of O
two O
reasons O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
big O
for O
a O
portable O
system O
. O

That O
' O
a O
nice O
feature O
, O
but O
headlining O
" O
charge O
three O
devices O
at O
the O
same O
time O
" O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
stretch O
. O

The O
provided O
short O
USB O
extender O
cable O
is O
bendable O
so O
it O
can O
be O
used O
to O
aim O
the O
Trendnet O
at O
the O
WiFi O
source O
to O
get O
a O
better O
signal O
. O

Good O
product O
for O
the O
money O
. O

Its O
not O
often O
these O
days O
you O
can O
get O
something O
like O
this O
for O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O

I O
got O
this O
Sanoxy O
keyboard O
case O
for O
a O
Datawind O

Well O
this O
is O
my O
second O
sleeve O
for O
my O
laptop O
, O
this O
time O
I O
changed O
my O
machine O
for O
a O
Dell O
Inspiron O
15R O
, O
2012 O

What O
I O
like O
about O
it O
.. O
is O
the O
keyboard O
FEEL O
. O

I O
work O
on O
an O
i7 O
at O
my O
job O
and O
it O
is O
a O
power O
hog O
- O
this O
machine O
's O
i5 O
allows O
for O
decent O
battery O
life O
. O

The O
Evolution O
6 O
access O
is O
more O
round O
at O
the O
top O
which O
somewhat O
limits O
access O
- O
making O
the O
8 O
an O
improvement O
on O
possibly O
the O
only O
flaw O
of O
the O
6 O
. O

Matches O
my O
old O
keyboard O
prfectly O
. O

This O
E O
- O
Port O
Plus O
replicator O
works O
perfectly O
with O
my O
Dell O
Latitude O
E5520 O
. O

e. O
, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
both O
use O
and O
charge O
the O
device O
simultaneously O
. O

~ O
it O
was O
nice O
but O
kept O
the O
computer O
hot O
, O
plus O
it O
came O
with O
a O
huge O
scratch O
across O
the O
top O
, O
no O
fault O
of O
Amazon O
, O
must O
of O
came O
out O

like O
that O

fairly O
easy O

I O
'm O
a O
graduate O
student O
, O
so O

I O
have O
read O
a O
few O
other O
reviews O
on O
other O
Samsung O
models O
that O
complain O
about O
the O
audio O
quality O
, O
but O
I O
was O
quite O
impressed O
with O
the O
sound O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
TV O
speakers O
after O
a O
little O
fine O
tuning O
with O
the O
equalizer O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
for O
notebook O
computers O
! O

I O
purchased O
this O
product O
after O
buying O
and O
then O
returning O
a O
smaller O
, O
less O
powerful O
Cooler O
Master O
laptop O
cooler O
earlier O
in O
the O
week O
. O

Light O
and O
good O
looking O
too O
! O

Only O
has O
happened O
a O
few O
times O
( O
though O
only O
when O
plugged O
in O
) O
, O
but O
speedfan O
will O
always O
read O
a O
low O

anyways O
. O

My O
Dell O
Inspiron O
17r O
fits O
nicely O
in O
its O
compartment O
, O
with O
a O
velcro O
tie O
down O
should O
you O
want O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Quiet O
, O
but O
came O
with O
a O
broken O
fan O
which O
created O
a O
horrible O
noise O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
powered O
on O
my O
new O
computer O
build O
. O

Very O
impressive O
cleaning O
cloth O
. O

Cord O
is O
smooth O
and O
nice O
and O
pliable O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

I O
got O
this O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
utilize O
an O
old O
VGA O
flat O
panel O
monitor O
with O
my O
brand O

I O
got O
this O
free O
of O
cost O
from O
nvidia O
- O
HP O
settlement O
after O
my O
dual O
core O
dv6113us O
's O
display O
broke O
down O
. O

This O
screen O
is O
" O
true O
" O
1080 O
HD O
resolution O
-the O
specs O
on O
this O
page O
are O
wrong O
. O

I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
this O
for O
a O
school O
laptop O
. O

She O
used O
it O
at O
school O
and O
home O
. O

I O
was O
being O
used O
normally O
and O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
died O
. O

Failed O
to O
maintain O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
connection O
. O

Overall O
I O
like O
it O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
quite O
nice O
, O
especially O
for O
this O
price O
segment O
. O

PQ O
is O
so O
top O

. O

The O
6-cell O
battery O
life O
is O
good O
( O
4:45 O
hours O
in O
both O
Auto O
Mode O
or O
Power O
Saving O
Mode O
) O
, O
but O
far O
short O
of O
the O
advertised O
six O
or O
seven O
hours O
. O

So O
i O
'd O
recommend O
this O
as O
a O
replacement O
to O
a O
lost O
charger O
, O
and O
its O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
. O

What O
more O
could O
anyone O
ask O
for O
? O

For O
anyone O
who O
already O
owns O
a O
capable O
multifunction O
device O
such O
as O
the O
PPC-6700 O
or O
Treo O
650 O
or O
700 O
, O
the O
Nokia O
N800 O
is O
superfluous O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
door O
slides O
left O
and O
right O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
there O
is O
at O
least O
1 O
. O
5 O
inches O
of O
flat O
surface O
on O
either O
side O
of O
your O
webcam O
so O
that O
the O
door O
will O
move O
freely O
. O

The O
back O
compartment O
is O
for O
a O
laptop O
with O
a O
padding O
slot O
that O
easily O
fits O
your O
PC O
and O
a O
Velcro O
strap O
that O
you O
can O
fasten O
to O
prevent O
it O
from O
moving O
. O

+ O
pay O
the O
parcel O
for O
a O

I O
will O

fine O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
options O
that O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
make O
a O
choice O
. O

They O
are O
inherently O
weak O
and O
I O
broke O
the O
two O
that O
I O
bought O
. O

First O
there O
came O
the O
desk O
top O
, O
introducing O
us O
to O
the O
wonderful O
world O
of O
computers O
but O
not O
a O
handy O
carry O
- O
it O
- O
with O
- O
you O
item O
. O

It O
extends O
my O
capabilities O
and O
is O
convenient O
. O

But O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
the O
shipping O
to O
return O
. O

The O
only O
major O
negative O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
design O
of O
it O
's O
mouse O
. O

Just O
like O
others O
who O
have O
favorably O
reviewed O
this O
product O
, O
I O
also O
had O
a O
wheezing O
dinosaur O
of O
a O
laptop O
that O
I O
was O
about O
to O
blow O
up O

Hard O
to O
beat O
. O

This O
may O
not O
necessarily O
be O
an O
entirely O
bad O
thing O
, O
as O
tools O
such O
as O
Start8 O
allow O
one O
to O
sort O
of O
bring O
back O
parts O
of O
the O
Windows O
7 O
user O
interface O
, O
such O
as O
the O
start O
menu O
. O

Logitech O
was O
quite O
helpful O
as O
well O
, O
as O
they O
fulfilled O
the O
3 O
year O
partial O
warranty O
with O
no O
trouble O
. O

We O
suggest O
you O
place O
a O
new O
order O
as O
the O
refund O
has O
already O
been O
processed O
. O

I O
might O
have O
a O
newer O
revision O
of O
this O
keyboard O
b O
/ O
c O
other O
complaints O
such O
as O
volume O
buttons O
being O
in O
the O
wrong O
order O
and O
the O
trackball O
is O
too O
light O
do O
n't O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
case O
with O
my O
keyboard O
. O

I O
had O
some O
problem O
with O
the O
touch O
pad O
at O
first O
. O

the O
micro O
USB O
ends O
are O
different O
in O
all O
three O
photos O
! O
! O
! O

Well O
this O
mouse O
has O
other O
problems O
too O
. O

Not O
the O
thinnest O
on O
the O
market O
-- O
you O
can O
find O
1/2 O
inch O
thin O
laptops O
, O
but O
you O
'll O
pay O
more O
. O

No O
Mac O
support O
whatsoever O
. O

do O
nt O
like O
: O

With O
the O
$ O
15 O
rebate O
my O
cost O
will O
be O
$ O
27 O
. O

I O
use O
this O
with O
a O
PDA O
and O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
truly O
plug O
and O
play O

It O
's O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
to O
fix O
my O
dad O
's O
HP O
laptop O
. O

The O
build O
quality O
on O
this O
bag O
is O
the O
same O
as O
my O
older O
one O
... O
excellent O
. O

you O
need O
to O
avoid O
this O
privacy O
filter O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
space O
between O
keys O
and O
joystick O
manipulation O
created O
the O
most O
difficulty O
I O
encountered O
with O
the O
G13 O
. O

They O
look O
cool O
, O
and O
these O
speakers O
remind O
me O
of O
them O
. O

It O
has O
a O
stellar O
battery O
life O
. O

I O
would O
order O
from O
them O
again O
. O

My O
USB O
mike O
prefers O
to O
be O
connected O
direct O
to O
machine O
and O
not O
a O
hub O
. O

They O
sound O
great O
, O
but O
the O
stand O
design O
makes O
them O
move O
around O
the O
desk O
when O
played O
loud O
. O

Great O
idea O
right O
? O

I O
hopped O
in O
my O
car O
, O
drove O
to O
Verizon O
and O
picked O
up O
aMOTOROLA O
XOOM O
Android O
Tablet O
( O
10 O
. O
1-Inch O
, O
32 O
GB O
, O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
) O
with O
a O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
. O

Now O
this O
gadget O
rest O
on O
my O
desk O
where O
I O
have O
easy O
access O
to O
it O
. O

The O
fan O
can O
be O
loud O
after O
a O
bit O
of O
use O
but O
the O
unit O
stays O
cool O
throughout O
projection O
. O

It O
looks O
great O
, O
is O
waterproof O
, O
but O
I O
wonder O
how O
durable O
. O

In O
sum O
, O
this O
is O
a O
keyboard O
with O
a O
pretty O
fancy O
feature O
set O
. O

The O
fans O
do O
n't O
move O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
air O
but O
its O
decent O
enough O
to O
cool O
a O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
just O
cool O
and O
has O
decent O
sound O
. O

Works O
great O
after O
a O
single O
charge O
. O

With O
Windows O
Xp O
I O
just O
put O
the O
cd O
in O
the O
drive O
and O
plugged O
the O
USB O
cord O
in O
and O
windows O
did O
the O
rest O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the O
photons O
are O
less O
handy O
than O
water O
when O
my O
dog O
is O
behaving O
inappropriately O
in O
the O
front O
yard O
, O
but O
they O
're O
still O
pretty O
handy O
. O

- O
it O
is O
different O
but O
with O
this O
laptop O
's O
touch O
screen O
its O
quite O
a O
nice O
way O
to O
navigate O
and O
use O
applications O
. O

Showed O
up O
as O
expected O
, O
no O
frills O
, O
good O
price O
, O
worked O
great O
. O

The O
unit O
is O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
and O
it O
syncs O
up O
with O
an O
iphone O
with O
no O
troubles O
. O

I O
suppose O
this O
is O
a O
case O
of O
getting O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Almost O
worth O
knocking O
down O
to O
three O
stars O
just O
for O
that O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
your O
operating O
system O
in O
a O
DVD O
, O
Flash O
Drive O
or O
cloned O
on O
new O
SSD O
drive O
before O
you O
remove O
the O
old O
hard O
drive O
. O

When O
using O
the O
Oyen O
CD O
to O
install O
the O
drivers O
it O
correctly O
identified O
that O
I O
already O
had O
a O
previous O
version O
of O
the O
NEC O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
controller O
chip O
drivers O
installed O
. O

Comes O
with O
two O
stereo O
audio O
input O
cables O
, O
the O
first O
one O
died O
13 O
months O
into O
use O
. O

Will O
run O
10 O
hours O
or O
more O
on O
a O
full O
charge O
. O

After O
following O
all O
the O
steps O
received O
in O
an O
email O
from O
Anker O
, O
it O
still O
did O
not O
work O
. O

Al O
comprarlo O
esperaba O
obtener O

That O
will O
be O
a O
true O
test O
. O

I O
am O
a O
bit O
shocked O
, O
because O
Kensington O
has O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
given O
me O
good O
quality O
items O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
bluetooth O
adapter O
for O
my O
computer O
. O

What O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

Gift O
for O
a O
family O
member O
that O
revived O
a O
tablet O
for O
Christmas O
. O

If O
someone O
is O
considering O
to O
use O
this O
USB O
for O
a O
PS3 O
's O
accessories O
like O
playstation O
eye O
or O
anything O
else O
, O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
USB O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
hardware O
configuration O
( O
and O
the O
extra O
' O
plug O
- O
ins O
' O
) O
of O
your O
laptop O
/ O
desktop O
, O
you O
may O
experience O
static O
noise O
and/or O
latency O
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
quality O
of O
your O
headphones O
and/or O
speakers O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
my O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
Tab O
2 O
10-inch O
, O
and O
the O
cable O
is O
compatible O
w/o O
problems O
and O
a O
good O
length O
. O

So O
i O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
in O
- O
laws O
and O
it O
works O
VERY O
well O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
you O
understand O
that O
you O
re O
getting O
a O
small O
portable O
speaker O

I O
'm O
still O
happy O
with O
the O
computer O
in O
general O
. O

Be O
super O
clear O
that O
it O
might O
not O
work O
even O
for O
the O
models O
listed O
. O

I O
had O
to O
replace O
two O
due O
to O
my O
fault O
. O

My O
monitor O
has O
a O
bit O
of O
backlight O
bleed O
and O
some O
unevenness O
in O
the O
lighting O
( O
this O
is O
hit O
or O
miss O
and O
varies O
by O
monitor O
) O
. O

I O
installed O
VMware O
Fusion O
, O
and O
now O
boot O
Windows O
XP O
right O
from O
within O
Mac O
OS O
X. O

Gets O
floppy O
. O

The O
stiching O
is O
n't O
the O
best O
as O
far O
as O
being O
straight O
and O
clean O

I O
will O
need O
to O
get O
another O
since O
the O
cracks O
are O
getting O
longer O
. O

I O
've O
probably O
owned O
way O
more O
flash O
drives O
and O
SD O
cards O
than O
the O
average O
person O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
'll O
buy O
another O
brand O
flash O
drive O
ever O
again O
. O

4-Inch O
Laptop O
( O
Aluminum O
) O

Over O
time O
I O
'm O
afraid O
this O
will O
cause O
the O
cord O
to O
break O
. O

New O
drivers O
are O
much O
better O
. O

The O
mouse O
is O
a O
good O
size O
; O
small O
enough O
to O
carry O
around O
with O
the O
laptop O
, O
but O
not O
so O
tiny O
that O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
hand O
cramp O
. O

The O
Casem O
hanging O
organizer O
is O
a O
God O
- O
send O
for O
any O
neat O
freak O
. O

The O
instructions O
notwithstanding O
, O
at O
15 O
to O
20 O
dollars O
less O
than O
the O
nearly O
identical O
Alfa O
adapter O
( O
Amazon O
prices O
) O
, O
it O
's O
definitely O
a O
good O
buy O
( O
assuming O
it O
does O
n't O
die O
, O
too)!By O
the O
way O
, O
the O
delivery O
time O
was O
very O
prompt O
-- O
a O
few O
days O
faster O
than O
promised O
, O
and O
the O
packaging O
was O
appropriately O
robust O
. O

I O
contacted O
ASUS O
and O
was O
told O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
delete O
them O
from O
the O
tablet O
. O

Firstly O
, O
I O
really O
like O
the O
size O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

If O
you O
buy O
a O
book O
on O
Apple O
programming O
, O
you O
can O
expect O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
paperweight O
within O
three O
months O
. O

Welp O
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
end O
this O
review O
here O
, O
and O
just O
brag O
about O
how O
great O
this O
size O
is O
, O
and O
, O
in O
this O
case O
, O
LESS O
IS O
TRULY O
, O
TRULY O
, O
TRULY O
, O
so O
much O
more O
. O

I O
really O
enjoy O
browsing O
the O
web O
on O
this O
and O
it O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
transfer O
files O
between O
this O
and O
a O
computer O
when O
you O
put O
them O
on O
an O
SD O
card O
in O
the O
card O
slot O
, O
but O
the O
battery O
life O
on O
this O
is O
pretty O
disappointing O
. O

Love O
my O
Targus O
backpack O
. O

This O
item O
is O
beyond O
cute O
! O

The O
card O
works O
and O
the O
card O
reader O
works O
. O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
laptop O
. O

Power O
supply O
worked O
well O
until O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
. O

The O
less O
powerful O
model O
performs O
91 O
% O
as O
quickly O
as O
the O
Core O
i7 O
model O
, O

I O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
bag O
. O

The O
area O
for O
files O
looks O
good O
but O
if O
you O
put O
a O
binder O
and O
some O
files O
in O
there O
it O
is O
tough O
to O
close O
when O
you O
have O
a O
laptop O
in O
the O
other O
compartment O
. O

I O
use O
my O
chromebook O
nearly O
every O
day O
, O
and O
not O
once O
since O
I O
've O
owned O
it O
has O
it O
limited O
me.----Overall O
, O
this O
is O
an O
attractive O
looking O
, O
effective O
peice O
of O
technology O
. O

This O
wireless O
adapter O
is O
a O
replacement O
. O

Certainly O
, O
Ubuntu O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
powerful O
; O
but O
if O
you O
're O
the O
only O
one O
you O
know O
who O
has O
it O
, O
then O
your O
friends O
ca O
n't O
help O
you O
. O

Even O
after O
30 O
minutes O
on O
my O
lap O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
feel O
uncomfortable O
. O

Since O
I O
did O
not O
format O
it O
for O
XFS O
, O
the O
performance O
was O
not O
really O
that O
good O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
performance O
, O
the O
notebook O
is O
pretty O
fast O
( O
it O
has O
a O
decent O
2 O
. O

The O
other O
thing O
about O
the O
fans O
is O
that O
they O
are O
easily O
replaceable O
, O
or O
even O
upgradeable O
: O
they O
are O
standard O
3-pin O
PC O
case O
fans O
, O
and O
the O
manual O
states O
that O
you O
can O
use O
either O
120 O

or O
140 O
mm O
fans O
with O
the O
Storm O

mounting O

; O
I O
do O
n't O
foresee O
many O
circumstances O
in O
which O
I O
am O
carrying O
the O
bag O
unzipped O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
my O
laptop O
might O
slide O
out O
. O

This O
unit O
works O
occasionally O
with O
Time O
Machine O
. O

Perfect O
for O
what O
I O
use O
it O
for O
. O

This O
monitor O
comes O
with O
Analog O
and O
digital O
video O
cables O
which O
is O
nice O
because O
the O
digital O
video O
cables O
give O
off O
a O
much O
better O
looking O
display O
. O

But O
just O
remember O
, O
it O
's O
a O
netbook O
, O
not O
a O
Core2Duo O
2 O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
lap O
- O
top O
. O

I O
can O
make O
the O
choppy O
audio O
go O
away O
by O
opening O
the O
Sound O
control O
panel O
, O
and O
keeping O
it O
on O
the O
recording O
tab O
( O
go O
figure O
) O
. O

Not O
hassle O
- O
free O
. O

Great O
product O

Are O
the O
engineers O
and O
programmers O
at O

starving O
for O
something O
to O
do O
with O
their O
time O
? O

, O
do O
n't O
really O

the O

but O
i O
am O
not O
calling O
them O
for O
help O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
phone O
call O
... O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
get O
second O
one O
for O
my O
second O
location O

I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
double O
zippers O
for O
the O
top O
opening O
and O
the O
case O
unzips O
not O
only O
at O
the O
top O
but O
also O
down O
2 O
inches O
on O
each O
side O
, O
making O
it O
easy O
to O
put O
the O
tablet O
in O
and O
get O
it O
out O
. O

like O
I O
do O
and O
need O
to O
do O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
trekking O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
connect O
them O
via O
bluetooth O
to O
external O
speakers O
so O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
for O
me O
. O

The O
only O
but O
that O
I O
have O
is O
that O
the O
orientation O
of O
the O
cable O
, O
when O
plugged O
in O
, O
is O
opposite O
of O
what O
I O
need O
when O
my O
device O
is O
in O
its O
case O
. O

The O
handle O
is O
not O
as O
supportive O
as O
it O
should O
be O

. O

I O
'm O
not O
about O
to O
throw O
this O
into O
the O
shower O
to O
really O
test O
it O
. O

Construction O
is O
quite O
solid O
. O

The O
transfer O
speed O
is O
n't O
blinding O

The O
keyboard O
cover O
does O
provide O
the O
following O
benefts O
... O

I O
am O
not O

34;techy&#34 O
; O
, O
so O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
give O
you O
the O
technical O
review O
of O
this O
product O
. O

I O
am O
using O
this O
item O
for O
last O
several O
months O
. O

I O
opened O
it O
up O
and O
it O
was O
a O
black O
screen O
. O

This O
is O
a O
better O
investment O
than O
purchasing O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

battey O
life O
seems O
an O
ok O
4 O
hours O
. O

I O
had O
over O
40 O
pounds O
in O
it O
daily O
and O
used O
it O
daily O
carrying O
work O
items O
and O
laptop O
w O
/ O
accessories O
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
travle O
speaker O
, O
and O
for O
that O
it O
sounded O
great O
. O

To O
charge O
or O
store O
the O
MoGo O
Mouse O
X54 O
simply O
close O
the O
kickstandand O
insert O
it O
into O
the O
Expresscard/54 O
slot O
. O

They O
do O
include O
adapters O
, O
but O
ironically O
, O
none O
of O
them O
work O
with O
my O
growing O
collection O
of O
the O
most O
common O
tablets O
on O
the O
market O
. O

is O
limited O
to O
150 O
mbps O
. O

so O
when O
you O
flip O
the O
case O
open O
, O
it O
automatically O
wakes O
your O
ipadEvenly O
- O
spaced O
keys O
for O
smooth O
and O

typingHigh O
quality O
case O
and O

: O

I O
mean O
quality O
in O
general O
, O
which O
today O
is O
something O
that O
we O
see O
less O
and O
less O
of O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
got O
this O
product O
free O
for O
my O
honest O
review O
. O

Had O
to O
reset O
the O
cable O
modem O
( O
unplug O
, O
plug O
back O
in O
) O

" O
Ultrabook O
Sapphire O
Blue O
Intel O
Core O
i5 O
3317U O
( O
1 O
. O
70GHz O
) O

I O
am O
giving O
it O
4 O
stars O
, O
though O
, O
instead O
of O
5 O
, O
as O
it O
is O
not O
without O
some O
glitches O
in O
design O
. O

They O
suggested O
updating O
the O
drivers- O
except O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
when O
the O
hardware O
is O
not O
detected O
. O

Amazon O
never O
fails O
to O
provide O
me O
with O
the O
best O
price O
for O
products O
I O
seek O
to O
purchase O
. O

so O
I O
say O
buy O
it O
. O

This O
was O
a O
perfect O
fit O
. O

Not O
particularly O
sturdy O
, O
but O
it O
sits O
on O
top O
of O
the O
Mac O
Mini O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
must O
have O
done O
something O
wrong O
and O
I O
tried O
something O
different O
this O
time O
around O
and O
its O
still O
working O
perfect O
after O
3 O
years O
now O
.. O

The O
angular O
styling O
makes O
these O
attractive O
, O
and O
the O
auxiliary O
input O
jack O
is O
a O
nice O
extra O
in O
budget O
speakers O
. O

If O
you O
seek O
a O
highly O
musical O
, O
full O
range O
, O
robust O
audio O
solution O
, O
look O
elsewhere O
. O

I O
got O
this O
so O
I O
could O
go O
twice O
as O
long O
without O
a O
charge O
. O

Called O
J&R O
; O
Computer O
World O
which O
was O
the O
company O
that O
sent O
it O
out O
. O

D O
- O
Link O
is O
an O
excellent O
product O
to O
get O
all O
your O
laptop O
contents O
on O
you O
TV O
screen O
. O

fit O
's O
wonderfully O
and O
protects O
it O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

It O
does O
not O
become O
distorted O
when O
the O
volume O
is O
raised O
. O

I O
still O
have O
to O
do O
more O
testing O
as O
everyone O
said O
more O
memory O
would O
speed O
up O
my O
slow O
computer O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
that O
effect O
yet O
. O

You O
probably O
do O
n't O
need O
the O
extension O
depending O
on O
type O
of O
PC O
you O
use O
and O
you O
can O
just O
plug O
the O
nano O
receiver O
into O
the O
USB O
. O

Finally O
, O
you O
'll O
find O
a O
standard O
microUSB O
port O
. O

Does O
n't O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O

My O
17 O
" O
MBP O
does O
n't O
have O
one O
either O
while O
the O
smaller O
MBPs O
do O
! O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2006 O
, O
when O
I O
got O
this O
, O
great O
laptop O
webcams O
were O
n't O
really O
mainstream O
anyway O
. O

However O
, O
most O
software O
works O
good O
. O

The O
same O
reason O
why O
iPad O
will O
not O
charge O
on O
most O
USB O
ports O
. O

This O
is O
also O
the O
best O
price O
I O
could O
find O
. O

My O
previous O
ASUS O
laptops O
have O
been O
stellar O
, O
but O
definately O
not O
this O
one O
. O

Acer O
Aspire O
One O
AOD150 O
- O
1165 O
10 O
. O

I O
use O
the O
TARGUS O
PA248U O
Tornado O
Notebook O
Chill O
PadIt O
is O
a O
simple O
solution O
. O

This O
makes O
for O
a O
very O
short O
list O
of O
potential O
laptops O
. O

Late O
2010 O
perfectly O

It O
's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
watch O
YouTube O
on O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
computer O
! O

Immediately O
after O
getting O
it O
, O
I O
opened O
the O
brand O
new O
sealed O
package O
, O
and O
card O
was O
recognized O
. O

But O
, O
I O
use O
a O
mouse O
when O
I O
can O
. O

Targus O
makes O
great O
products O
, O
so O
it O
was O
no O
surprise O
to O
find O
that O
their O
A O
& O
16 O
" O
Laptop O
Backpack O
is O
well O
- O
made O
. O

There O
is O
even O
an O
internal O
clip O
in O
the O
front O
compartment O
for O
keys O
. O

Thought O
I O
could O
use O
this O
to O
enable O
either O
a O
USB O
data O
connection O
or O
a O
USB O
power O
connection O
so O
I O
could O
use O
my O
nexus O
as O
a O
power O
source O
... O

When O
I O
started O
with O
this O
battery O
, O
I O
was O
getting O
a O
little O
over O
1 O
. O
5 O
hours O
per O
charge O
. O

So O
far O
not O
a O
single O
glitch O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
case O
to O
anyone O
. O

It O
has O
the O
ability O
if O
you O
let O
Apple O
to O
locate O
it O
if O
it O
gets O
lost O
or O
stolen O
. O

We O
used O
to O
get O
his O
signal O
intermittently O
on O
the O
laptop O
, O
but O
with O
this O
plugged O
in O
with O
the O
hi O
- O
gain O
antenna O
, O
we O
get O
4 O
out O
of O
5 O
bars O
! O

The O
Windows O
7 O
Starter O
is O
just O
that O
, O
but O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O

One O
last O
thing O
- O
the O
WebCam O
camera O
is O
1 O
. O
3 O
pixels O
, O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

I O
had O
another O
video O
camera O
that O
used O
minidisks O
and O
it O
was O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
neck O
. O

Also O
wondering O
what O
bluetooth O
video O
camera O
to O
use O
, O
for O
video O
chat O
, O
if O
there O
even O
is O
a O
bluetooth O
video O
camera O
-- O
maybe O
that O
's O
a O
USB O
thing O
. O

These O
earphones O
are O
very O
similar O
in O
sound O
quality O
to O
Bose O
speakers O
. O

But O
hey O
, O
it O
has O
increased O
my O
speeds O
two O
fold O
. O

There O
is O
a O
& O
# O
34;memory O
- O
type&#34 O
; O
foam O
inside O
the O
main O
compartment O
to O
protect O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
case O
has O
semi O
hard O
sides O
, O
and O
works O
great O
for O
lap O
protection O
and O
keep O
the O
bottom O
vents O
of O
the O
netbook O
open O
to O
air O
. O

4 O
" O
widescreen O
notebook O
fits O
inside O
fine O
-- O
there O
is O
still O
a O
little O
room O
around O
, O
but O
not O
much O
-- O
it O
does O
not O
fit O
like O
a O
glove O
though O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
my O
textbooks O
this O
semester O
are O
all O
pretty O
large O
, O
but O
if O
I O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
make O
it O
to O
my O
car O
between O
each O
class O
to O
swap O
out O
texts O
, O
this O
bag O
probably O
would O
be O
too O
small O
to O
be O
functional O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
casual O
user O
, O
however O
i O
recommend O
something O
less O
expensive O
. O

For O
a O
company O
that O
charges O
as O
much O
as O
they O
do O
for O
their O
products O
, O
this O
should O
be O
a O
given O
. O

This O
hub O
encompasses O
all O
of O
these O
features O
and O
I O
would O
sincerely O
recommend O
this O
! O

So O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
clear O
case O
and O
am O
quite O
content O
with O
it O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
Han O
Solo O
going O
through O
hyperspace O
! O

so O
that O
's O
not O
as O
big O
of O
a O
deal O
as O
I O
may O
be O
making O
it O
out O
to O
be O
. O

Get O
two O
of O
them O
( O
I O
did O
) O
so O
you O
can O
patch O
together O
a O
good O
working O
version O
in O
the O
case O
of O
manufacturing O
flaws O
. O

This O
little O
device O
does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
and O
does O
it O
well O
. O

And O
you O
sure O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
- O
or O
the O
many O
great O
scenes O
to O
choose O
from O
. O

The O
power O
supply O
that O
came O
with O
it O
, O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
. O

Pictures O
that O
are O
sized O
1920x1080 O
pixels O
fit O
the O
screen O
perfectly O
and O
are O
very O
sharp O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there O
is O
some O
kind O
of O
a O
very O
subtle O
hardware O
problem O
that O
causes O
hard O
disk O
problems O
to O
gradually O
accumulate O
. O

Good O
price O
and O
2 O
days O
delivery O
using O
PRIME O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
to O
convert O
rca O
video O
to O
vga O
for O
a O
home O
security O
camera O
. O

I O
love O
the O
vent O
holes O
cut O
out O
on O
the O
bottom O
, O
and O
the O
feet O
to O
prop O
it O
up O
. O

Knocked O
it O
down O
a O
star O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

One O
thing O
to O
lookout O
for O
is O
the O
size O
. O

so O
maybe O
my O
rating O
is O
not O
fair O
. O

The O
involving O
sound O
in O
your O
ears O
make O
a O
really O
good O
time O
for O
music O
listening.- O
Great O
for O
use O
with O
VoIP O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
connectivity O
. O

In O
the O
week O
I O
have O
tested O
this O
product O
I O
have O
found O
it O
to O
be O
very O
stable O
and O

Great O
bag O
overall O
. O

So O
no O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
getting O
Charge O
memory O
problems O
. O

I O
am O
not O
afraid O
to O
leave O
in O
in O
my O
MacBookPro O
when O
transporting O
it O
because O
the O
profile O
is O
negligible O
. O

Used O
it O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
and O
forgot O
it O
was O
on O
there O
! O

While O
the O
product O
fits O
and O
works O
with O
my O
Dell O
M1330 O
, O
my O
AC O
adapter O
will O
not O
charge O
it O
. O

I O
'd O
have O
to O
get O
a O
12 O
. O
1 O
" O
for O
that O
, O
and O
none O
seem O
to O
have O
the O
combination O
of O
features O
that O
this O
little O
jewel O
has O
. O

There O
are O
also O
a O
couple O
of O
mesh O
pockets O
on O
each O
end O
of O
the O
compartment O
interior O
. O

so O
i O
went O
to O
their O
site O
to O
find O
no O
drivers O
or O
anything O
i O
need O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O
now O
its O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O

I O
decided O
to O
buy O
this O
Logitech O
USB O
powered O
speaker O
for O
it O
's O
portability O
. O

The O
8 O
GB O
is O
key O
for O
me O
because O
videos O
take O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
. O

It O
is O
very O
flexible O
allowing O
easy O
handling O
and O
the O
stylus O
has O
very O
good O
reaction O
and O
convenience O
! O

The O
construction O
quality O
is O
' O
built O
- O
to O
- O
last O
' O
, O
and O
it O
has O
a O
zipper O
which O
covers O
your O
stuff O
from O
weather O
in O
a O
weather O
' O
resistant O
' O
compartment O
. O

The O
black O
case O
around O
the O
silver O
keyboard O
/ O
palm O
rest O
is O
a O
really O
good O
looking O
combination O
. O

Plenty O
of O
memory O
, O
fas O
processor O
and O
full O
HD O
screen O
are O
great O
. O

By O
the O
time O
all O
the O
delayed O
emails O
had O
been O
sorted O
out O
, O
my O
30 O
days O
was O
up O
and O
I O
was O
out O
of O
luck O
. O

My O
bookmarks O
, O
my O
themes O
, O
my O
extensions O
, O
my O
apps O
, O
EVERYTHING O
. O

Great O
battery O
life O
. O

Just O
like O
a O
brand O
new O
IBM O
battery O
and O
a O
cheaper O
price O
with O
the O
same O
quality O
. O

I O
use O
this O
mainly O
for O
backing O
up O
my O
cds O
and O
movies O
and O
there O
s O
enough O
room O
to O
host O
your O
website O
. O

again O
this O
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
with O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
work O
with O
an O
exacto O
knife O
I O
can O
get O
both O
locks O
to O
engage/ O

I O
bought O
this O
since O
it O
was O
only O
$ O
5 O
( O
and O
I O
got O
it O
free O
thanks O
to O
swagbucks O
) O
, O
and O
I O
plugged O
it O
up O
. O

It O
's O
very O
clear O
and O
you O
can O
set O
it O
to O
follow O
your O
movements O
. O

I O
am O
always O
on O
the O
go O
shooting O
all O
types O
of O
things O
, O
but O
primarily O
time O
lapse O
in O
the O
natural O
world O
. O

It O
did O
come O
with O
a O
snap O
into O
place O
holder O
to O
hold O
disk O
drive O
in O
and O
also O
two O
screws O
to O
insert O
into O
the O
back O
to O
hold O
drive O
. O

but O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
describe O
how O
amazing O
it O
feels O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
take O
anywhere O
- O
the O
beach O
, O
on O
a O
picnic O
, O
etc O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
cable O
is O
already O
powering O
up O
one O
of O
my O
two O
Socket O
940 O
AMD O
boxes O
( O
used O
for O

and O
a O
reliable O
but O
not O
perfectly O
cable O
- O
matched O
power O
supply O
and O
an O
identical O
one O
is O
being O
burn O
- O
in O
tested O
now O
. O

There O
s O
many O
more O
problems O
that O
can O
happen O

I O
have O
lost O
all O
respect O
for O
both O
HP O
and O
Google O
Chrome O
based O
upon O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
seem O
perfectly O
comfortable O
ripping O
off O
the O
average O
customer O
like O
me O
. O

As O
much O
as O
I O
hate O
it O
I O
am O
seriously O
considering O
buying O
them O
a O
PC O
and O
dumping O
the O
chromebook O
because O
I O
simply O
can O
not O
support O
them O
without O
basic O
tools O
. O

It O
curves O
up O
the O
front O
of O
the O
pack O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
to O
account O
for O
the O
footprint O
of O
the O
bag O
increasing O
as O
you O
cram O
it O
full O
of O
stuff O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
if O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
working O
on O
computers O
. O

For O
my O
part O
I O
recommend O
ampliamante O
. O

Light O
weight O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'll O
try O
a O
Dell O
next O
and O
pay O
less O
for O
wrong O
- O
support O
- O
docsSo O
a O
Y570 O
with O
BIOS O

. O

you O
want O
dedicated O
graphics O
but O
ca O
n't O
stomach O
the O
high O
price O
, O
get O
the O
refurbished O
mid O
2012 O
model O
- O
they O
are O
being O
sold O
at O
great O
, O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
suggest O
is O
be O
careful O
with O
how O
much O
you O
bend O
it O
. O

It O
allows O
for O
easy O
current O
flow O
and O
sturdy O
connections O
. O

Regardless O
, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
mini O
jack O
in O
the O
back O
which O
you O
can O
use O
and O
, O
irrespective O
of O
bad O
MP3 O
data O
, O
it O
delivers O
the O
best O
actual O
stereo O
fidelity O
sound O
( O
as O
long O
as O
you O
use O
Apple O
Lossless O
or O
other O
lossless O
codec O
) O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
battery O
and O
it O
lasted O
me O
a O
week O
before O
it O
died O
. O

I O
wished O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
write O
this O
review O
, O
I O
love O
laptops O
and O
have O
many O
. O

I O
do O
not O
mind O
learning O
new O
things O
and O
this O
machine O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
extra O
effort O
. O

I O
was O
initially O
skeptical O
about O
the O
whole O
SpeedBooster O
claims O
. O

EXACTLY O
like O
your O
original O
Apple O
battery O
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
magnets O
to O
help O
keep O
certain O
parts O
closed O
. O

You O
can O
watch O
movies O
on O
this O
thing O
, O
just O
make O
sure O
you O
buy O
a O
bigger O
sd O
card O
. O

It O
is O
pretty O
darn O
tiny O
. O

BulkSynch O
Type O

They O
went O
down O
really O
easily O
. O

These O
ones O
are O
made O
in O
the O
factory O
next O
door O
and O
they O
work O
the O
same O
for O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
. O

A O
light O
in O
the O
end O
of O
the O
unit O
lets O
you O
know O
it O
works O
. O

The O
HP O
website O
states O
battery O
life O
is O
9 O
hours O
. O

My O
Samsung O
does O
not O
perform O
as O
well O
and O
I O
avoid O
talking O
about O
it O
. O

This O
New O
Trent O
battery O
is O
so O
much O
of O
an O
improvement O
. O

UPDATE O
10/19/12 O
: O
I O
installed O
my O
first O
game O
, O
XCOM O
: O
Enemy O
Unknown O
. O

Good O
strong O
case O
and O
that O
protects O
well O
even O
if O
dropped O
( O
not O
recommended O
) O

Everything O
else O
about O
the O
Aspire O
One O
is O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

I O
should O
have O
spent O
another O
$ O
100 O
or O
$ O
150 O
for O
a O
more O
useful O
item O
. O

Ordered O
to O
replaced O
the O
damaged O
OEM O
charger O
for O
my O
Dell O
Laptop O
. O

ASUS O
is O
STILL O
releasing O
updates O
for O
this O
tablet O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
including O
useful O
programs O
with O
the O
tablet O
( O
and O
rolling O
out O
new O
ASUS O
software O
, O
such O
as O
their O
stylus O
input O
program O
which O
works O
amazing O
well O
! O
) O
. O

When O
it O
works O
, O
its O
great O
... O

My O
freshman O
year O
I O
attempted O
to O
lug O
around O
my O
huge O
15 O
inch O
laptop O
from O
class O
to O
class O
. O

Bottom O
line O
here O
: O

This O
ai O
n't O
a O
regular O
bagpack O
, O
this O
is O
a O
huge O
bag O
! O

I O
really O
like O
this O
case O
. O

but O
this O
adaptor O
does O
not O
work O
to O
connect O
the O
dvi O
monitor O
to O
my O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

The O
battery O
fit O
is O
tight O
and O
otherwise O
precise O
, O
so O
this O
minor O
annoyance O
that O
took O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
fix O
with O
a O
nail O
file O
will O
be O
fast O
forgotten O
. O

It O
worked O
as O
expected O
. O

Move O
the O
USB O
outlets O
to O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
device O
, O
or O
put O
them O
on O
the O
top O
, O
just O
get O
them O
away O
from O
the O
end O
with O
the O
plug O
, O
and O
things O
will O
be O
better O
. O

It O
is O
light O
and O
sturdy O
. O

What O
if O
Microsoft O
did O
n't O
provide O
you O
Windows O
Updates O
after O
owning O
your O
shiny O
new O
Packard O
Bell O
for O
9 O
months O
? O

It O
is O
not O
a O
wall O
wart O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
the O
optical O
drive O
from O
my O
Late O
2008 O
MacBook O
Pro O
( O
first O
generation O
unibody O
) O
. O

and O
still O
I O
'm O
fine O
. O

Plenty O
of O
room O
. O

It O
is O
able O
to O
obtain O
power O
from O
the O
WD O
player O
without O
any O
trouble O
. O

I O
even O
bought O
a O
new O
laptop O
hoping O
the O
Archos O
7 O
would O
sync O
to O
the O
Vista O
Home O
Premium O
Windows O
media O
player O
. O

Where O
the O
Titanium O
felt O
flimsy O
and O
was O
subject O
to O
pits O
, O
scratches O
and O
dings O
( O
because O
of O
the O
painted O
surface O
) O
, O
this O
one O
can O
take O
a O
pounding O
with O
its O
anodized O
aluminum O
exterior O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
hit O
the O
power O
switch O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
On O
Stage O
II O
, O
turned O
my O
Mini O
on O
, O
and O
was O
in O
business O
. O

I O
have O
found O
that O
for O
my O
needs O
this O
computer O
has O
done O
very O
well O
. O

Great O
travel O
workhorse O
. O

But O
I O
hesitated O
a O
lot O
because O
reviews O
were O
very O
mixed O
. O

Your O
USB O
cord O
hides O
under O
the O
" O
leg O
" O
. O

Comes O
with O
a O
low O
profile O
bracket O
as O
well O
, O
even O
with O
the O
card O
pushed O
up O
against O
my O
back O
wall O
I O
still O
get O
full O
signal O
. O

Great O
but O
check O
the O
specs O
of O
your O
device O
to O
make O
sure O
. O

It O
will O
not O
go O
into O
the O
slot O
. O

Something O
besides O
the O
original O
packaging O
any O
who O
. O

Does O
n't O
require O
any O
extra O
pressure O
for O
me O
to O
type O
on O
rubber O
keyboard O
. O

I O
disconnected O
from O
the O
first O
connection O
that O
was O
surely O
the O
internal O
antenna O
and O
made O
sure O
I O
was O
using O
the O
& O
# O
8220;new&#8221 O
; O
connection O
. O

The O
gold O
plated O
connectors O
and O
cable O
appearance O
is O
of O
good O
quality O
and O
a O
good O
choice O
to O
use O
as O
a O
USB O
data O
cable O
. O

After O
all O
the O
good O
reviews O
on O
this O
item O
I O
had O
high O
expectations O
for O
these O
speakers O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
using O
the O
car O
vacuum O
cleaner O
at O
home O
, O
the O
Vacuum O
Cleaner O
is O
rated O
12V O
, O
2 O
Amp O
, O
and O
this O
DC O
adapter O
is O
rated O
7A O
, O
but O
this O
DC O
adapter O
is O
not O
able O
to O
power O
up O
the O
Vacuum O
Cleaner O
, O
it O
is O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

but O
that O
's O
not O
really O
HP O
specific O
. O

This O
unit O
can O
get O
quite O
loud O
as O
well O
. O

Toshiba O

other O
reviews O
in O
the O
internet O
before O
buying O
this O
. O

You O
know O
what O
that O
means O
! O

I O
bought O
the O
extra O
ram O
, O
but O
after O
90 O
odd O
days O
, O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
bother O
to O
install O
it O
! O

Well O
worth O
it O
. O

There O
is O
absolutely O
no O
excuse O
for O
the O
lousy O
performance O
in O
this O
area O
. O

compress O
the O
footage O
, O
and O
there O
's O
less O
money O
left O
over O
to O
put O
into O
the O
optics O
and O
sensor O
. O

However O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
tell O
from O
pics O
if O
those O
guards O
block O
the O
vent O
directly O
behind O
them O
-- O
I O
hope O
for O
Kuzy O
buyers O
with O
15&#34 O
; O
late-2013 O
MBPs O
, O
that O
there O
are O
slots O
to O
allow O
airflow O
out O
-- O
otherwise O
their O
shell O
is O
a O
potential O
liability O
. O

the O
main O
reason O
I O
bought O
from O
Anker O
( O
and O
their O
reputation O
and O
the O
fact O

Two O
prong O
connector O
comes O
out O
of O
power O
supply O
a O
bit O
too O
easy O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Toshiba O
computer O
, O
I O
love O
the O
first O
one O
, O
a O
Satellite O
laptop O
, O
but O
it O
's O
too O
big O
to O
tote O
around O
on O
planes O
and O
trips O
. O

.Many O
of O
the O
reviews O
note O
that O
once O
you O
plug O
in O
the O
USB O
transmitter O
your O
sound O
card O
directs O
all O
its O
signal O
to O
the O
receiver O
. O

The O
text O
on O
the O
N800 O
screen O
is O
rather O
small O
. O

I O
have O
not O
experienced O
the O
annoying O
sounds O
reported O
by O
other O
reviewers O
. O

just O
close O
the O
plastic O
lid O
. O

It O
really O
is O
a O
5-star O
device O

At O
first O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
a O
gimmick O
. O

2she O
seen O
it O
at O
best O
buy O
and O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
, O
so O
I O
told O
her O
let O
me O
order O
it O
from O
amazon O
when O
we O
get O
home O
, O
by O
doing O
this O

This O
94005 O
unit O
has O
buttons O
on O
the O
front O
to O
pause O
and O
stop O
the O
music O
so O
you O
do O
not O
need O
to O
access O
your O
phone O
or O
device O
inside O
that O
stores O
your O
music O
. O

And O
the O
third O
one O
lasted O
me O
quite O
a O
while O
before O
someone O
left O
my O
bedroom O
door O
open O
while O
I O
was O
at O
work O
and O
the O
new O
puppy O
decided O
to O
chew O
through O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
Chrome O
book O
..... O
integration O
with O
all O
Google O
apps O
is O
awesome O
. O

Strangely O
enough O
this O
blower O
works O
better O
than O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
Laptop O
( O
HP O
DV7 O
) O
. O

Upon O
further O
inspection O
, O
eyeballing O
at O
an O
angle O
I O
find O
hard O
to O
describe O
, O
I O
can O
see O
an O
imperfection O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
aluminum O
, O
as O
if O
it O
was O
bent O
. O

and O
it O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
for O
the O
price O
, O
IMO O
. O

I O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
Windows O
automatically O
installed O
the O
drivers O
. O

Targus O
has O
shrunk O
the O
footprint O
by O
about O
an O
inch O
all O
around O
on O
the O
new O
model O
. O

This O
charger O
from O
day O
1 O
was O
built O
stronger O
, O
and O
I O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
since O
. O

They O
include O
some O
adhesive O
hard O
plastic O
spacers O
that O
stick O
onto O
the O
end O
of O
the O
lock O
so O
that O
it O
is O
snug O
against O
your O
computer O
. O

and O
you O
can O
download O
most O
android O
/ O
chrome O
apps O
to O
it O
. O

The O
bass O
driver O
is O
HUGE O
! O

( O
forget O
it O
if O
you O
have O
a O
touch O
- O
screen O
! O
) O
. O

I O
even O
carry O
the O
XPad O
in O
my O
computer O
bag O
because O
, O
on O
most O
flights O
in O
economy O
class O
, O
there O
is O
n't O
enough O
room O
between O
me O
and O
the O
seat O
in O
front O
of O
me O
to O
extend O
the O
monitor O
to O
the O
proper O
position O
. O

I O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
the O
3N1 O
- O
33 O
since O
I O
first O
learned O
of O
its O
impending O
arrival O
in O
November O
2009 O
. O

1A O
, O
and O
the O
5W O
iPhone O
charger O
is O
5V O
at O
1A. O

Seems O
to O
be O
working O
just O
fine O
, O
and O
it O
's O
certainly O
a O
lot O
cheaper O
than O
the O
other O
brands O
. O

First O
, O
Zagg O
is O
really O
really O
stingy O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
application O
solution O
they O
provide O
you O
. O

I O
have O
charged O
the O
receiver O
for O
more O
than O
6 O
hours O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
product O
exceeds O
in O
the O
Apple O
way O
. O

it O
's O
a O
nice O
bag O
, O
but O
had O
i O
known O
that O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
such O
a O
tight O
fit O
for O
my O
MSI O
g70 O

I O
am O
always O
seeing O
great O
signal O
strength O
with O
Windows O
8 O
. O
1 O
. O

I O
like O
the O
design O
. O

So O
overall O
, O
just O
get O
it O
already O
! O

* O
Has O
vents O
on O
the O
bottom O
for O
heat O
dissipationUPDATE O
: O
Still O
working O
after O
a O
year O
. O

Their O
Bears O
by O
Dre O
brand O
is O
just O
.. O
not O
my O
style O
. O

Exact O
fit O
for O
2011 O
early O
model O
Macbook O
Pro O
13 O
. O

However O
, O
when O
you O
have O
enough O
hardware O
crammed O
in O
a O
laptop O
that O
would O
put O
most O
tower O
PCs O
to O
shame O
, O
a O
little O
extra O
weight O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

or O
so O
that O
are O
100 O
times O
better O
then O
this O
one O
. O

Typical O
Amazon O
purchase O
experience O

I O
came O
home O
one O
day O
to O
it O
making O
a O
funny O
periodic O
whining O
noise O
, O
and O
it O
would O
not O
send O
power O
to O
the O
computer O
. O

It O
fits O
my O
computer O
fine O
. O

" O
plastic O
tabs O
that O
prop O
the O
speaker O
up O
off O
the O
surface O
and O
allow O
the O

to O

. O

Overall O
very O
nice O

They O
have O
a O
nice O
heft O
, O
soft O
touch O
and O
solid O

( O
including O
automatically O
starting O
Outlook O
) O
took O
over O
90 O
seconds O
. O

The O
neoprene O
material O
is O
nice O
, O
the O
handle O
is O
somewhat O
secure O
, O
but O
I O
also O
wanted O
to O
put O
my O
other O
hand O
under O
the O
bag O
just O
in O
case O
the O
handle O
breaks O
off O
. O

so O
just O
using O
one O
video O
output O
. O

I O
used O
to O
have O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
and O
always O
misplaced O
them O
. O

Literally O
my O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
compartment O
for O
books O
or O
larger O
items O
is O
a O
little O
too O
small O
, O
it O
might O
not O
accomodate O
very O
large O
textbooks O

I O
have O
an O
extra O
one O
already O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
the O
price O
difference O
was O
n't O
that O
big O
of O
a O
deal O
, O
and O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
my O
choice O
to O
go O
with O
the O
OWC O
Data O
Doubler O
. O

If O
money O
is O
a O
key O
factor O
..... O
its O
better O
than O
nothing O
; O
but O
if O
you O
can O
, O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
and O
get O
something O
better O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
it O
take O
pressure O
off O
my O
wrists O
and O
hands O
when O
typing O
, O
it O
also O
bumps O
up O
the O
height O
of O
the O
laptop O
screen O
several O
inches O
. O

Nice O
fidelity O
but O
not O
much O
volume O
through O
internal O
speakers O
; O
excellent O
signal O
through O
3 O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
from O
before O
I O
had O
upgraded O
Internet O
Explorer O
, O
so O
IE O
no O
longer O
worked O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
reinstall O
Internet O
Explorer O
. O

Everything O
was O
there O
and O
it O
was O
like O
new O
. O

I O
think O
I O
've O
used O
it O
twice O
in O
the O
last O
6 O
months O
... O

I O
've O
owned O
a O
number O
of O
Dell O
laptops O
, O
usually O
getting O
a O
new O
one O
every O
two O
or O
three O
years O
. O

this O
is O
a O
good O
unit O
for O
what O
it O
is O
- O
so O
I O
'm O
giving O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

I O
got O
this O
computer O
at O
a O
really O
good O
price O
when O
my O
I3 O
1 O
TB O
2 O
. O
2 O
GHz O
8 O
GB O
RAM O
Gateway O
was O
damaged O
by O
lightening O
. O

The O
flowers O
in O
the O
island O
scenes O
were O
a O
sight O
to O
behold O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
like O
the O
sound O
quality O
of O
the O
Sony O
better O
than O
the O
i300 O
, O
but O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
rather O
small O
differences O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
. O

Before O
with O
the O
dual O
band O
USB O
N750 O

Thank O
you O
to O
all O
that O
mentioned O
going O
to O
the O
bios O
so O
that O
the O
memory O
would O
be O
recognized O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
at O
how O
well O
built O
and O
good O
looking O
this O
guy O
was O
out O
of O
the O
package O
. O

A O
smaller O
power O
adapter O
is O
a O
plus O
as O
well O
; O
will O
easily O
fit O
into O
the O
front O
pocket O
of O
theCase O
Logic O
LNEO-12 O

. O

I O
take O
my O
word O
back O
to O
those O
people O
who O
saw O
me O
using O
this O
netbook O
. O

No O
wonder O
why O
many O
others O
are O
leaving O
your O
brand O
in O
droves O
. O

The O
envelope O
was O
wrapped O
with O
around O
5 O
layers O
of O
bubble O
wrap O
( O
small O
bubbles O
, O
not O
large O
) O
, O
and O
then O
placed O
in O
a O
vinyl O
shipping O
envelope O
. O

I O
've O
gotten O
at O
least O
three O
complete O
phone O
recharges O
out O
of O
one O
battery O
backup O
charge O
. O

INI O
file O
to O
the O
system O
. O

So O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
drop O
a O
computer O
in O
our O
kitchen O
for O
our O
kids O
to O
use O
we O
obviously O
did O
n't O
think O
to O
have O
a O
CAT-5 O
cable O
run O
to O
the O
kitchen O
pantry O
for O
the O
tower O
( O
long O
story O
as O
to O
why O
it O
's O
there O
) O
. O

The O
inertial O
scrolling O
is O
a O
keeper O
though.- O

So O
I O
returned O
the O
mouse O
and O
instead O
bought O
aLogitech O
LS1 O
Laser O
Mouse O
. O

Plugs O
into O
a O
USB O
port O
and O
blows O
a O
fan O
to O
keep O
my O
laptop O
cool O
. O

These O
accessories O
( O
necessary O
for O
many O
people O
) O
will O
cost O
as O
much O
as O
a O
decent O
PC O
computer O
! O
3 O
) O
Some O
older O
software O
wo O
n't O
run O
or O
will O
have O
problems O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
convenient O
size O
, O
weight O
, O
and O
its O
durability O
. O

Instead O
, O
this O
is O
some O
similar O
looking O
but O
very O
different O
gadget O
. O

It O
can O
get O
confusing O
shopping O
for O
certain O
things O
online O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
pro O
and O
con O
reviews O
that O
accompany O
the O
merchandise O
, O
but O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
listened O
to O
the O
favorable O
reviews O
of O
this O
product O
because O
it O
was O
just O
what O
I O
wanted O
/ O
needed O
and O
at O
a O
decent O
price O
as O
well O
. O

I O
waited O
for O
several O
months O
to O
get O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
which O
one O
to O
buy O
. O

The O
shoulder O
strap O
is O
especially O
handy O
. O

I O
HATE O
to O
have O
to O
return O
this O
laptop O
. O

Apple O
products O
generally O
work O
out O
the O
small O
issues O
on O
their O
own O
, O
you O
only O
get O
problems O
when O
it O
's O
something O
big O
. O

There O
is O
a O
PIP O
function O
, O
but O
no O
button O
on O
the O
remote O
to O
access O
it O
. O

And O
certainly O
it O
's O
high O
- O
speed O
performance O
( O
when O
matched O
with O
a O
compatible O
WAP O
) O
is O
a O
benefit O
, O
and O
a O
cheaper O
option O
than O
other O
, O
faster O
wireless O
standards O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
hardware O
the O
DV4 O
is O
a O
nice O
computer O
and O
now O
the O
software O
is O
improving O
. O

Thank O
you O
Anker O
for O
the O
awesome O
quality O
of O
your O
Charger O
/ O
Adapter O
. O

I O
've O
connected O
it O
to O
a O
usb O
extension O
cable O
and O
will O
bear O
with O
it O
until O
I O
can O
get O
a O
good O
gaming O
mouse O
. O

While O
the O
& O
# O
8220;Mega O
Bass&#8221 O
; O
setting O
might O
be O
quite O
an O
exaggeration O
, O
it O
sounds O
much O
richer O
and O
mellower O
, O
and O
as O
far O
as O
I&#8217;m O
concerned O
, O
this O
is O
the O
permanent O
setting O
for O
the O
Boomax O
. O
& O
# O
8220;Mega O
Bass&#8221 O
; O
provides O
a O
more O
balanced O
sound O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
was O
surprisingly O
good O
, O
and O
it O
has O
a O
non O
- O
slip O
base O
that O
also O
serves O
to O
enhance O
the O
sound O
quality O
when O
placed O
on O
the O
desktop O
. O

The O
built O
in O
audio O
jack O
makes O
this O
mini O
speaker O
even O
more O
portable O
. O

It O
is O
slightly O
heavier O
and O
bigger O
then O
some O
other O
models O
and O
when O
true O
portability O
above O
all O
is O
required O
you O
may O
want O
to O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
either O
no O
mouse O
at O
all O
or O
some O
extra O
small O
Bluetooth O
model O
that O
wo O
n't O
get O
an O
extra O
precious O
USB O
slot O
. O

The O
reviews O
on O
this O
speaker O
convinced O
me O
to O
purchase O
it O
. O

With O
4 O
GB O
of O
ram O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
" O
bog O
" O
the O
computer O
down O
, O
and O
with O
500 O
GB O
HD O
it O
should O
last O
for O
many O
years O
before O
filling O
up O
. O

It O
should O
be O
in O
the O
back O
( O
IMHO O
) O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
fan O
is O
not O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
hotspot O
user O
who O
walks O
to O
coffee O
shops O
daily O
. O

No O
fuss O
and O
no O
complaint O
. O

Overall O
and O
particularly O
at O
this O
price O
, O
definitely O
recommended O
! O

The O
laptop O
's O
power O
supply O
cord O
and O
several O
CDs O
/ O
DVDs O
fit O
easily O
into O
the O
main O
pocket O
along O
with O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
did O
some O
temperature O
measurements O
with O
and O
without O
, O
and O
it O
makes O
several O
degrees O
difference O
. O

Another O
modification O
I O
will O
be O
doing O
in O
the O
near O
future O
is O
to O
upgrade O
the O
Hard O
drive O
to O
a O
solid O
state O
HD O
, O
this O
will O
surely O
increase O
the O
speeds O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

These O
are O
perfect O
protectors O
and O
they O
fit O
perfectly O
. O

Today O
my O
wife O
called O
for O
me O
from O
the O
other O
room O
where O
she O
was O
working O
on O
her O
HP O
laptop O
( O
with O
this O
charger O
) O
. O

But O
by O
the O
way O
, O
the O
reason O
why O
I O
'm O
updating O
this O
review O
is O
because O
mostly O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
specs O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
more O
about O
how O
comforting O
physically O
it O
is O
to O
use O
this O
laptop O
. O

Also O
many O
people O
& O
critical O
reviewers O
have O
said O
that O
win8 O
is O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

Case O
feels O
a O
little O
flimsy O
and O
flexes O
under O
its O
own O
weight O
when O
carried- O
Bloatware O
is O
annoying O
. O

I O
like O
the O
concept O
. O

Oh O
, O
if O
you O
purchase O
something O
from O
their O
website O
( O
I O
got O
three O
extra O
batteries O
for O
this O
unit O
at O
approx O
$ O
100 O
) O
, O
they O
want O
to O
confirm O
you O
are O
who O
you O
say O
you O
are O
if O
you O
use O
a O
credit O
card O
. O

I O
would O
ruin O
the O
pins O
, O
but O
it O
was O
fine O
. O

It O
has O
the O
light O
weight O
and O
simplicity O
of O
a O
tablet O
and O
some O
of O
the O
versatility O
of O
a O
laptop O
. O

So O
good O
that O
I O
ordered O
one O
for O
me O
and O
two O
other O
ones O
for O
two O
different O
friends O
. O

Thus O
far O
this O
battery O
has O
worked O

good O
adjustibilty O
, O
nice O
looks O
, O
does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
! O
! O
! O

The O
laptops O
is O
nice O

Maybe O
in O
six O
months O
it O
will O
be O
more O
of O
a O
benefit O
. O

When O
that O
was O
done O
, O
it O
showed O
duplicate O
channels O
I O
had O
n't O
selected O
. O

1 O
machine O
without O
any O
additional O
drivers O
required O
. O

However O
, O
it O
's O
just O
as O
stated O
. O

The O
fit O
is O
great O
( O
no O
movement O
of O
the O
tablet O
in O
the O
case O
) O
and O
all O
buttons O
are O
accessible O
. O

Avoid O
this O
item O
. O

Great O
construction O
and O
nice O
modern O
look O
that O
goes O
well O
with O
your O
equipment O
. O

A O
full O
charge O
seems O
to O
last O
the O
same O
as O
original O
battery O
. O

My O
life O
has O
changed O
because O
of O
this O
device O
. O

The O
speed O
is O
good O
and O
I O
can O
scan O
the O
net O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

It O
worked O
immediately O
, O
showed O
5/5 O
bars O
, O
and O
I O
was O
flying O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
keeping O
these O
around O
for O
any O
future O
trips O
to O
South O
Africa O
. O

Once O
connected O
the O
R36 O
will O
show O
a O
blue O
LED O
on O
the O
left O
labeled O
LAN O
. O

I O
love O
the O
way O
it O
snaps O
all O
around O
the O
laptop O

After O
doing O
the O
research O
on O
ultra O
books O
, O
ASUS O
UX31A O
and O
Dell O
XPS O
13 O
are O
the O
two O
final O
candidates O
. O

No O
, O
there O
is O
no O
firmware O
update O
. O

I O
did O
not O
want O
a O
Starter O
Edition O
of O
Windows O
7 O
on O
a O
netbook O
. O

For O
around O
the O
house O
, O
its O
awesome O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
if O
you O
are O
a O
man O
with O
big O
hands O
you O
will O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
use O
any O
keyboard O
this O
size O
. O

This O
bad O
boy O
is O
AWESOME O
! O

The O
cloths O
work O
reasonably O
well O
and O
are O
certainly O
worth O
buying O
. O

I O
had O
ordered O
2 O
replacement O

before O
this O
( O
via O

still O
had O

a O

I O
live O
in O
NY O
and O
it O
is O
the O
most O
cumbersome O
thing O
... O
also O
the O
conversion O
to O
messenger O

the O

off O

It O
's O
also O

pretty O

to O

you O
're O

if O
those O
people O
that O
like O
to O
take O

. O

I O
tried O
it O
on O
my O

and O
it O
works O
on O
there O
too O
. O

So O
I O
called O

any O
electronic O

with O
a O
mini O
5-pin O

that O

Bought O
my O
whole O

at O

but O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
extra O
lag O
while O
playing O
COD O
Black O
Ops O
on O
the O
360 O
or O
while O
streaming O
1080p O

to O
my O

. O

I O
like O
the O
plain O
, O
neutral O
color O
also O
. O

After O
confirming O
that O
the O
second O
adapter O
worked O
on O
the O
computer O
in O
question O
( O
and O
that O
the O
now O
non O
- O
functioning O
adapter O
did O
not O
work O
on O
our O
other O
computer O
) O
and O
reinstalling O
the O
driver O
, O
to O
no O
avail O
, O
I O
have O
concluded O
that O
the O
adapter O
has O
died O
. O

uselessjust O
save O
your O
money O
and O
buy O
something O
better O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
always O
like O
looking O
like O
my O
entire O
home O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
as O
much O
as O
I O
used O
to O
, O
but O
I O
love O
it O
. O

My O
first O
attempt O
was O
using O
the O
SSD O
in O
slot O

for O
both O
Mac O
and O
Vista O
, O
but O
it O
would O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
install O
both O
- O
apparently O
a O
known O
issue O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
a O
very O
useful O

which O
is O
good O

I O
decided O
to O
buy O
a O
external O
hard O

to O
keep O

The O

limited O
edition O
. O

a O
333Mhz O
Graphite O
DV O
. O

my O
old O
laptop O
you O
could O
fry O
eggs O
on O
that O
thing O
for O
how O
hot O
it O
ran O
! O

It O
has O
lots O
of O
room O
for O
other O
stuff O
. O

* O
Great O
keyboard O
shortcuts O
. O

- O
i O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
snap O
my O
red O
one O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
this O
purple O

Padding O
is O
not O
as O
thick O
as O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
, O
but O
acceptable O
. O

In O
the O
Samsung O
9 O
's O
case O
, O
this O
ended O
up O
being O
the O
Fn O
- O
F3 O
combination O
. O

But O
then O
again O
, O
I O
would O
not O
do O
that O
with O
any O
of O
the O
carry O
bags O
either O
. O

The O
software O
is O
fairly O
customisable O
and O
is O
surprisingly O
' O
Mac O
- O
like O
' O
. O

Works O
perfectly O
. O

I O
was O
supplied O
a O
sample O
for O
test O
and O
evaluation O
, O
and O
I O
promised O
that O
my O
review O
is O
fair O
and O
honest O
. O

So O
now O
I O
have O
this O
cable O
dangling O
all O
over O
the O
place O
and O
the O
USB O
end O
of O
the O
cable O
does O
n't O
really O
fit O
when O
you O
close O
the O
case O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
notebook O
pushing O
those O
dimensions O
consider O
a O
larger O
bag O
. O

Some O
mid O
- O
level O
rearrangement O
, O
however O
, O
and O
an O
upgrade O
to O
non O
- O
basic O
version O
, O
and O
the O
system O
functions O
well O
. O

I O
took O
advantage O
of O
, O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
would O
almost O
be O
worth O
any O
price O
tag O
Apple O
could O
put O
on O
it O
. O

I O
think O
the O
mouse O
is O
a O
little O
cheap O
looking O

During O
my O
trip O
I O
was O
working O
on O
research O
projects O
, O
designs O
, O
contracts O
and O
proposals O
. O

If O
they O
would O
have O
used O
an O
opaque O
ink O
when O
printing O
the O
letters O
on O
the O
keys O
it O
would O
have O
worked O
much O
better O
. O

I O
mostly O
wanted O
it O
for O
blu O
- O
ray O
discs O
and O
documentary O
shows O
. O

I O
got O
this O
today O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
bam O
it O
worked O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
tweak O
anything O
. O

The O
little O
prop O
stand O
and O
wire O
storage O
door O
are O
fairly O
cheap O
and O
flimsy O
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
they O
will O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

The O
inside O
of O
the O
pouch O
itself O
is O
done O
in O
grey O
neoprene O
. O

It O
's O
lightweight O
and O
portable O
so O
you O
can O
move O
it O
and O
plug O
it O
in O
near O
where O
you O
are O
sitting O
. O

" O
i O
simply O
received O
a O
response O
that O
sincerely O
apologized O
for O
the O
problem O
along O
with O
a O
fedex O
prepaid O
label O
to O
mail O
them O
my O
defective O
unit O
. O

It O
fits O
nicely O
inside O
the O
pack O

It O
's O
my O
choice O
for O
my O
personal O
notebook O
. O

These O
Altec O
Lansing O
PC O
speakers O
strike O
a O
nice O
balance O
between O
the O
two O
. O

No O
phone O
modem O

April O
2014 O
: O
8 O
months O
ago O
I O
upgraded O
to O
4Gb O
of O
RAM O
( O
the O
max O
that O
this O
machine O
supports O
) O
and O
swapped O
out O
the O
mechanical O
hard O
drive O
with O
an O
SSD O
drive O
. O

No O
restore O
software O
. O

6 O
Linux O
Kernel O
series O
. O

I O
would O
be O
careful O
of O
that O

Very O
nice O
laptop O
. O

So O
far O
, O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
packed O
it O
pretty O
tight O
and O
headed O
to O
work O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
help O
me O
when O
I O
use O
my O
Logitech O
headset O
, O
because O
I O
was O
using O
the O
USB O
adapter O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
long O
- O
term O
performance O
. O

That O
said O
, O
it O
has O
worked O
well O
for O
two O
months O
now O
. O

I O
even O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
roommate O
for O
Christmas O
because O
he O
liked O
mine O
so O
much O
. O

I O
've O
had O
to O
put O
command O
hooks O
on O
it O

The O
supplied O
software O
is O
pretty O
good O
for O
helping O
identify O
and O
select O
new O
networks O
, O
though O
it O
does O
take O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
switch O
to O
a O
new O
network O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
cable O
to O
hook O
up O
our O
new O
Mac O
Mini O
to O
a O
ViewSonic O
LED O
monitor O
. O

It O
is O
still O
working O
well O
. O

I O
had O
a O
Sony O
VAIO O
Laptop O
, O
with O
15 O
. O
4 O
in O
screen O

For O
instance O
, O
if O
I O
move O
my O
cursor O
to O
the O
lower O
right O
corner O
, O
all O
currently O
open O
windows O
are O
displayed O
so O
you O
can O
effortlessly O
switch O
between O
them O
or O
if O
you O
move O
the O
cursor O
to O
the O
bottom O
left O
, O
the O
desktop O
is O
displayed O
. O

I O
got O
this O
drive O
to O
backup O
my O
200 O
GB O
macbook O
pro O
. O

But O
unfortunately O
the O
card O
has O
no O
' O
locking O
' O
type O
of O
connection O
. O

Anyways O
, O
in O
summary O
, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
in O
this O
product O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
measure O
the O
output O
voltage O
periodically O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
drifting O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
keyboard O
for O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
, O
although O
it O
is O
not O
perfect O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
well O
priced O
, O
attractive O
also O
, O
and O
has O
none O
of O
the O
case O
design O
issues O
mentioned O
. O

Total O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

Currently O
, O
I O
have O
it O
setup O
with O
my O
Macbook O
on O
DVI O
and O
Audio O
and O
Xbox O
through O
HDMI O
. O

I O
am O
super O
picky O
and O
want O
high O
end O
display O
and O
faster O
processor O
. O

They O
are O
hard O
plastic O
and O
made O
so O
that O
one O
handle O
fits O
into O
the O
other O
. O

it O
stays O
in O
place O
. O

I O
updated O
windows O
and O
installed O
the O
latest O
touchpad O
driver O
from O
Elantech O
, O
version O
10 O
. O

this O
thing O
is O
pretty O
cool O
. O

It O
puts O
out O
a O
generous O
amount O
of O
airflow O
. O

Kind O
of O
like O
cash O
registers O
with O
pictures O
of O
items O
instead O
of O
real O
numbers O
... O

You O
can O
accidentally O
press O
the O
Power O
button O
... O
it O
must O
be O
disabled O
in O
control O
panel O
- O
Power O
settingsDon't O
Like- O
Missing O
6th O
row O
in O
the O
keyboard O
for O
functions O
will O
keep O
you O
looking O
at O
the O
keyboard O
and O
will O
make O
you O
loose O
time O
or O
wo O
nt O
write O
more O
fluently O
. O

As O
typical O
with O
AMD O

Still O
, O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
compact O
little O
package O
, O
very O
solid O
, O
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
terribly O
bulky O
, O
even O
with O
the O
extra O
girth O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
purchased O
3 O
of O
these O
cases O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
only O
perk O
of O
this O
product O
for O
me O
is O
that O
it O
works O
with O
BT4/5 O
while O
penetration O
testing O
my O
own O
network O
. O

so O
I O
hope O
the O
problems O
have O
been O
corrected O
since O
then O
for O
new O
products O
. O

The O
price O
was O
very O
reasonable O
compared O
to O
what O
else O
is O
available O
at O
retail O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
2 O
video O
cards O
. O

* O
* O
work O
with O
dynamic O
microphones O
, O
although O
because O
of O
their O
low O
signal O
level O
, O
I O
would O
expect O
to O
have O
to O
crank O
the O
signal O
dial O
up O
. O

Fits O
perfectly O
and O
works O
great O
. O

It O
's O
smaller O
and O
shorter O
than O
the O
original O
, O
but O
it O
does O
seem O
to O
be O
working O
fine O
. O

Overall O
, O
for O
the O
price O
and O
design O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

... O
my O
fault O
- O
did O
n't O
notice O
amp O
rating O
( O
~.4amp O
! O
) O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
top O
part O
of O
the O
case O
, O
but O

But O
for O
day O
to O
day O
stuff O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

Great O
Netbook O
, O
I O
get O
lots O
of O
questions O
from O
curious O
people O
. O

The O
case O
is O
really O
hard O
to O
take O
off O
. O

Bought O
it O
specifically O
for O
my O
new O
Lenovo O
y500 O
, O
which O
is O
a O
bit O
chunky O
for O
a O
15 O
. O
6 O
by O
comparison O
, O
and O
its O
a O
pretty O
tight O
fit O
length O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
got O
this O
chill O
mat O
with O
the O
fans O
rather O
than O
the O
newer O
one O
that O
is O
adjustable O
. O

Got O
this O
one O
to O
take O
on O
the O
road O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
two O
headphonesBut O
still O
can O
not O
get O
the O
mike O
part O
to O
work O
with O
the O
phone O
switch O

Amplifying O
a O
certain O
track O
on O
screen O
is O
fine O
with O
me O
( O
if O
there O
is O
slight O
distortion O
, O
it O
's O
just O
being O
referenced O
for O
the O
vocalist O
, O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
) O
. O

It O
's O
about O
as O
plug O
& O
play O
as O
you O
can O
get O

The O
only O
complaint O
that O
I O
have O
is O
with O
the O
design O
of O
the O
elastic O
strap O
that O
keeps O
the O
case O
closed O
. O

I O
have O
always O
liked O
Antec O
products O
and O
this O
one O
is O
another O
great O
one O
. O

NOT O
TRUE O
-- O
the O
keyboard O
CAN O
be O
set O
to O
stay O
on O
all O
the O
time O
. O

A O
small O
inconvenience O
but O
still O
. O

& O
in O
memory O
category O
is O
the O
change O
it O
went O
form O
a O
5 O
. O

The O
HDD O
is O
very O
surprising O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
try O
setting O
that O
up O
as O
I O
already O
have O
a O
standalone O
router O
. O

It O
has O
an O
inner O
hard O
shell O
to O
protect O
to O
the O
screen O
while O
the O
Thrive O
is O
inside O
. O

One O
has O
the O
64 O
bit O
, O
the O
other O
two O
are O
bot O
32 O
bit O
OS O
computers O
. O

It O
will O
protect O
your O
MacBook O
Pro O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
care O
. O

I O
was O
a O
tad O
skeptical O
about O
it O
at O
first O
because O
of O
the O
price O

It O
's O
a O
useful O
accessory O

He O
can O
now O
hear O
things O
on O
his O
laptop O
that O
he O
had O
to O
do O
actual O
heavy O
lifting O
to O
hear O
, O
and O
can O
put O
the O
speakers O
close O
to O
his O
ear O
. O

and O
the O
small O
power O
supply O
is O
a O
nice O
change O
from O
the O
bricks O
that O
some O
manufacturers O
supply O
with O
notebooks O
. O

Several O
useful O
controls O
and O
looks O
good O
also O
. O

Most O
other O
splitters O
are O
rigid O
and O
bulky O
. O

but O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
trust O
this O
company O
because O
of O
this O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
good O
- O
three O
AAAs O
will O
last O
you O
a O
month O
or O
two O
with O
conservative O
daily O
use O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
notice O
the O
accessories O
compartment O
was O
held O
in O
place O
by O
zippers O
. O

Do O
nt O
be O
misguided O
by O
other O
stoopid O
reviews O
concerning O
lame O
customers O
with O
lame O
issues O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
for O
the O
price O
. O

I O
was O
told O
the O
problem O
was O
that O
it O
sucked O
too O
much O
power O
from O
the O
USB O
bus O
. O

I O
kept O
waffling O
between O
one O
and O
twostars O
, O
but O
I O
could O
not O
in O
good O
conscious O
give O
it O
two O
. O

All O
things O
considered O
it O
's O
an O
amazingly O
solid O
, O
well O
designed O
quality O
product O
, O
and O
I O
like O
it O
a O
lot O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
because O
of O
some O
poor O
design O
choices O
, O
maximum O
utility O
is O
not O
achieved O
. O

I O
can O
not O
brag O
enough O
about O
this O
machine O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Now O
, O
back O
with O
my O
486/80 O
running O
Dos O
6 O
. O
22 O
, O
I O
was O
always O
putting O
stuff O
in O
and O
taking O
things O
out O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
try O
. O

This O
caddy O
made O
it O
super O
simple O
for O
me O
to O
remove O
my O
old O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
drive O
, O
and O
install O
an O
additional O
hard O
drive O
into O
my O
early O
2008 O
Macbook O
Pro O
15&#34;. O

Pros O
( O
compared O
to O
Windows O
machines):+ O
Hands O
down O
, O
best O
battery O
life O
in O
the O
industry O
, O
when O
compared O
to O
similarly O
spec'd O
machines O
. O

So O
far O
it O
works O
fine O
functionally O
. O

I O
needed O
this O
because O
this O
very O
weekend O
i O
m O
going O
on O
a O
trip O
solo O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
arrived O
i O
tested O
it O
but O
guess O
what O
, O
it O
did O
nt O
work O
. O

with O
the O
limited O
onboard O
storage O
of O
only O
16 O
gb O
, O
my O
linux O
install O
must O
remain O
pretty O
light O
, O
but O
there O
is O
also O
a O
storage O
upgrade O
coming O
out O
soon O
for O
this O
acer O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
as O
with O
all O
Bose O
products O
, O
you O
will O
appreciate O
the O
stunning O
quality O
and O
performance O
. O

most O
bluetooth O
speakers O
do O
not O
have O
the O
audio O
out****. O

I O
have O
it O
mounted O
on O
a O
wall O
in O
our O
basement O
billiard O
room O
, O
where O
we O
use O
it O
to O
occasionally O
watch O
a O
program O
or O
listen O
to O
music O
( O
with O
in O
ceiling O
speakers O
) O
while O
hanging O
out O
. O

Nevermind O
wireless O
( O
54-mbps O
g O
network O
) O
-- O

I O
was O
trying O
to O
reattach O
it O
( O
why O
they O
ca O
n't O
just O
snap O
on O
and O
off O
like O
a O
desktop O
keyboard O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
) O
, O
but O
I O
then O
managed O
to O
also O
break O
off O
the O
" O
I O
" O
key O
. O

The O
flaps O
are O
large O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
reach O
and O
retrieve O
my O
Nikon O
D90 O
with O
power O
grip O
installed O
. O

I O
can O
deal O
with O
the O
size O
easily O
and O
love O
that O
it O
is O
a O
spinner O
type O
. O

As O
long O
as O
you O
keep O
the O
remote O
in O
A O
PLACE O
that O
you O
sure O
you O
can O
remember O
or O
find O
it O
later O
, O
the O
key O
finder O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
( O
if O
you O
lose O
the O
remote O
, O
there O
is O
no O
easy O
way O
to O
locate O
them O
) O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
... O
it O
's O
a O
fine O
router O
. O

, O
then O
I O
paird O
them O
up O
with O
this O
fiio O
mont O
blanc O
portable O
amp O
and O
it O
will O
defenitly O
make O
your O
mucsic O
sound O
realy O
good O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
order O
a O
few O
more O
just O
to O
have O
on O
hand O
. O

Worked O
great O
! O

It O
has O
tons O
of O
features O
, O
superb O
build O
quality O
, O
and O
excellent O
padding O
. O

Once O
I O
installed O
a O
600 O
watt O
COTS O
P O
/ O
S O
inside O
this O
dell O
tower O
& O
# O
34;test O
configuration O
unit&#34 O
; O
, O
the O
USB O
signals O
became O
& O
# O
34;Rock O

Again O
, O
when O
a O
twenty O
month O
old O
discovers O
that O
her O
little O
piggies O
can O
make O
things O
happen O
, O
Scooby O
Doo O
becomes O
tertiary O
entertainment O
. O

Although O
there O
is O
no O
sub O
- O
woofer O
and O
therefore O
limited O
range O
, O
I O
find O
the O
sound O
is O
adequate O
for O
my O
primary O
applications O
- O
watching O
movies O
online O
and O
some O
limited O
music O
samples O
. O

My O
wife O
coveted O
this O
case O
the O
second O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
its O
wrapping O
, O
but O
she O
gave O
it O
back O
after O
her O
first O
trip O
to O
the O
coffee O
shop O
. O

The O
memory O
is O
easy O
to O
upgrade O
, O
but O
swapping O
the O
drive O
is O
a O
booger O
! O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
Elec O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O
that O
the O
$ O
1200 O
laptops O
have O
, O
but O
it O
is O
extremely O
quick O
in O
doing O
everything O
I O
need O
when O
I O
go O
online O
. O

At O
not O
even O
half O
volume O
on O
the O
E5 O
, O
I O
had O
the O
music O
level O
I O
wanted O
, O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

GET O
THESE O
SPEAKERS O
! O
! O

4ghz O
as O
well O
as O
5Ghz O
reception O
to O
my O
wireless O
router O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
house O
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
keyboard O
protector O
, O
which O
looks O
great O
. O

The O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard O
is O
also O
really O
great O
, O
for O
comparisson O
I O
also O
work O
with O
a O
Lenovo O
laptop O
, O
those O
laptops O
always O
get O
good O
reviews O
for O
their O
keyboards O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinnion O
the O
keyboard O
on O
this O
machine O
has O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
of O
" O
clic O
" O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
just O
but O
love O
. O

Side O
walls O
could O
be O
removed O
to O
facilitate O
install O
. O

It O
really O
is O
very O
good O
. O

A O
fellow O
in O
my O
office O
made O
the O
same O
purchase O
and O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

I O
've O
installed O
games O
such O
as O
Fallout O
3 O
, O
Fallout O
New O
Vegas O
, O
Deadspace O
2 O
, O
Starcraft O
2 O
, O
and O
Just O
Cause O

. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
Apple O
logo O
, O
get O
the O
MacBook O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
very O
nice O
mouse O
that O
works O
well O
and O
feels O
very O
nice O
, O
then O
give O
this O
mouse O
a O
try O
. O

This O
last O
was O
surprising O
since O
the O
BB O
literature O
claims O
you O
can O
use O
them O
to O
provide O
music O
to O
a O
roomful O
of O
people O
. O

AmazonBasics O
are O
excellent O
products O
at O
the O
fraction O
of O
name O
brand O
. O

This O
likely O
means O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
very O
easy O
at O
some O
point O
to O
replace O
the O
smallish O
SSD O
with O
a O
larger O
capacity O
, O
off O
the O
shelf O
SSD O
with O
a O
proper O
connection O
adapter O
( O
the O
space O
below O
the O
trackpad O
allows O
for O
a O
commonly O
available O
, O
7 O
mm O
height O
SSD O
with O
regard O
to O
fit O
, O
though O
the O
connection O
is O
different O
) O
. O

No O
slack O
or O
room O
for O
anything O
else O

I O
did O
n't O
give O
it O
one O
star O
, O
because O
if O
you O
can O
verify O
you O
have O
tapered O
spring O
contacts O
, O
it O
might O
work O
fine O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
of O
excellent O
quality O
and O
of O
course O
it O
looks O
awesome O
... O

Immediately O
off O
the O
bat O
it O
kept O
freezing O
up O
. O

Since O
owning O
my O
Chromebook O
its O
got O
better O
and O
better O
with O
more O
features O
added O
and O
becoming O
more O
like O
a O
real O
OS O
. O

It O
also O
has O
additional O
padding O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
backpack O
that O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
in O
other O
bags O
. O

I O
guess O
a O
few O
trips O
to O
YouTube O
helps O
understand O
how O
Windows O
8 O
works O
. O

The O
square O
shape O
, O
with O
one O
USB O
port O
on O
each O
side O
, O
allows O
you O
to O
hook O
up O
wider O
or O
thicker O
devices O
( O
like O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
a O
Delkin O
e O
- O
Film O
CompactFlash O
card O
reader O
) O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
so O
awful O
because O
the O
screen O
is O
touch O
enabled O
but O
the O
screen O
also O
does O
not O
always O
register O
touches O
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
ordered O
this O
backpack O
for O
my O
newly O
- O
acquired O
Alienware O
M17x O
R3 O

" O
laptop O
. O

But O
this O
may O
be O
an O
issue O
if O
you O
are O
sensitive O
to O
noise O
in O
general O
. O

The O
Cintiq O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
starts O
up O
almost O
immediately O
, O
the O
programs O
open O
almost O
instantly O
and O
I O
have O
not O
noticed O
any O
lag O
even O
when O
using O
large O
- O
sized O
files O
. O

first O
off O
, O
it O
pairs O
fine O
and O
getting O
the O
ipad O
( O
4 O
) O
into O
the O
holder O
is O
a O
little O
harder O
than O
i O
would O
like O
it O
to O
be O
, O
and O
i O
m O
sure O
if O
i O
did O
nt O
have O
a O
skin O
on O
the O
front O
or O
back O
it O
might O
have O
got O
scratches O
while O
putting O
it O
in O
, O
but O
i O
like O
that O
it O
is O
tight O
and O
sturdy O
holding O
the O
ipad O
in O
place O
. O

1 O
" O

It O
will O
save O
you O
hassle O
and O
money O

I O
bought O
this O
after O
returning O
the O
Acer O
S3 O
Ultrabook O
.. O

Small O

i O
think O
i O
m O
going O
to O
get O
her O
one O
of O
these O
instead O
. O

The O
zipper O
seems O
sturdy O
and O
the O
material O
is O
good O
. O

This O
battery O
has O
been O
fine O
so O
far O
. O

( O
think O
signature O
) O

One O
or O
two O
GB O
wo O
n't O
do O
it O
if O
you O
're O
posting O
videos O
online O
. O

If O
you O
push O
down O
on O
the O
monitor O
, O
it O
does O
have O
a O
little O
more O
& O
# O
34;give&#34 O
; O
than O
the O
shorter O
arm O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
anyone O
would O
be O
pushing O
down O
on O
their O
monitor O
. O

If O
you O
need O
either O
multiple O
lighter O
plugs O
or O
usb O
this O
is O
a O
fine O
item O
at O
a O
good O
price O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
when O
watching O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
Netflix O
on O
the O
couch O
, O
I O
just O
keep O
it O
docked O
and O
that O
way O
I O
let O
the O
keyboard O
hold O
it O
for O
me O
. O

It O
will O
project O
a O
much O
larger O
image O

Yet O
a O
bigger O
problem O
is O
with O
its O
touch O
pad O
, O
specifically O
the O
button O
( O
note O
the O
singular O
form O
) O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
fast O
and O
well O
built O
. O

It O
has O
four O
USB O
ports O
. O

This O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
minor O
savings O
over O
the O
lifetime O
of O
the O
Macbook O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

At O
this O
price O
I O
ordred O
two O
. O

Its O
slim O
and O
50/50 O
on O
strong O
. O

For O
nearly O
a O
year O
, O
I O
owned O
a O
Galaxy O
Tab O
. O

Read O
the O
specification O
carefully O
. O

the O
minute O
it O
was O
unplugged O
, O
the O
laptop O
would O
sound O
a O
loud O
alarm O
that O
I O
was O
out O
of O
power O
. O

Glad O
to O
do O
business O
with O
you O
and O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
do O
business O
with O
you O
again O
! O

Especially O
compared O
to O
my O
crappy O
old O
dell O
that O
was O
5 O
years O
old O
. O

Birds O
and O
squirrels O
always O
look O
like O
they O
are O
hopping O
across O
the O
yard O
. O

These O
work O
well O
for O
adjusting O
your O
viewing O
angle O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
their O
intention O
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
degree O
of O
separation O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
laptop O
. O

Will O
re O
- O
partition O
after O
installation O
as O
have O
had O
more O
success O
scavenging O
files O
off O
' O
dead O
' O
HDD O
when O
they O
have O
multiple O
partitions O
. O

I O
just O
got O
mine O
and O
wow O
! O

Not O
sure O
why O
- O
we O
are O
n't O
rough O

After O
using O
this O
unit O
for O
awhile O
I O
realized O
the O
spacebar O
worked O
intermittently O

So O
much O
so O
that O
I O
've O
raised O
it O
from O
two O
to O
three O
stars O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
desire O
stereo O
, O
turn O
one O
off O
. O

and O
I O
only O
needing O
to O
unplug O
one O

, O
not O
several O
wires O
from O
the O
laptop O
, O
including O
printer O
, O
monitor O
, O
mouse O
, O
keyboard O
, O
etc O
. O

Just O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
go O

As O
a O
longtime O
and O
reasonably O
proficient O
Dell O
user O
, O
I O
am O
stunned O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Apple O
. O

but O
they O
will O
not O
operate O
, O
there O
are O
no O
drivers O
available O
to O
correct O
the O
issue O
, O

The O
software O
is O
fine O
. O

I O
have O
used O
it O
on O
my O
phone O
, O
my O
tablet O
, O
and O
all O
my O
flat O

and O
this O
iEraser O
picks O
up O
dust O
and O
smudges O
as O
gently O
as O
advertised O
. O

Energizer O
still O
does O
not O
have O
a O
tip O
for O
it O
. O

Minus O
a O
star O
because O
I O
did O
not O
receive O
any O
case O
which O
was O
advertised O
): O

This O
seems O
like O
a O
quality O
made O
item O
, O
I O
'm O
just O
not O
sure O
who O
it O
would O
be O
ideal O
for O
. O

I O
would O
purchase O
this O
again O
in O
an O
instant O
if O
I O
had O
an O
additional O
laptop O
. O

I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
before O
buying O
a O
tablet O
. O

That O
aside O
it O
connected O
to O
my O
Blackberry O
Torch O
9810 O
after O
I O
downloaded O
Blackberry O
's O
desktop O
Manager O
software O
to O
get O
the O
additional O
drivers O
I O
needed O
for O
the O
Bluetooth O
to O
work O
. O

The O
rubber O
feet O
on O
the O
laptop O
do O
fit O
on O
the O
cooling O
pad O
however O
, O
so O
being O
a O
little O
wider O
than O
the O
Xpad O
is O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
- O
especially O
since O
the O
Xpad O
is O
so O
slim O
. O

manifest O
( O
note O
to O
Amazon O
censors O

I O
've O
gotten O
cheaper O
cables O
before O
for O
my O
phone O

so O
durability O
may O
be O
an O
issue O

It O
has O
a O
nice O
gunmetal O
finish O
and O
smooth O
, O
round O
corners O
. O

My O
old O
Macbook O
battery O
started O
to O
separate O
and O
come O
apart O
. O

Instead O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
pass O
- O
thru O
WiFi O
feature O
, O
I O
am O
able O
to O
use O
a O
Novatel O

and O
connect O
this O

over O

to O
the O

to O
acquire O

Since O
I O
rarely O
take O
the O
laptop O
outside O
my O
home O
, O
it O
's O
always O
sitting O
on O
the O
mat O
on O
a O
shelf O
together O
. O

wise O
Mac O
OS O
can O
seem O
problematic O
, O
however O
this O
is O
just O
an O
illusion O
. O

It O
fits O
perfect O
for O
$ O
6 O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
magic O
fiber O
cloth O
. O

It O
is O
flexible O
, O
which O
for O
my O
need O
was O
essential O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
own O
this O
unit O
but O
I O
did O
get O
a O
first O
hand O

in O

and O
I O
ended O
up O
getting O
the O
wrong O
one O
. O

The O
keyboard O
itself O
is O
sturdy O
and O
quite O
responsive O
. O

Set O
up O
is O
plug O
and O
play O
( O
unlike O
Netgear O
) O
and O
picture O
quality O
is O
very O
good O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
use O
in O
two O
different O
laptops O

This O
laptop O
does O
exactly O
what O
it O
should O
do O
. O

I O
have O
solder O
altecs O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

The O
nice O
thing O
about O
this O
design O
is O
the O
little O
extra O
material O
going O
up O
the O
backside O
of O
the O
main O
case O
body O
to O
the O
straps O
... O

Not O
really O
a O
con O
, O
but O
I O
find O
the O
blue O
led O
unnecessary O
, O
and O
really O
bright O
in O
a O
dark O
room O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
only O
thing O
, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
about O
the O
bag O
is O
the O
storage O
for O
the O
tripod O
. O

Perhaps O
future O
buyers O
can O
be O
forwarned O
to O
pay O
a O
bit O
more O
and O
get O
a O
quality O
that O
will O
last O
for O
more O
than O
one O
month O

to O
downgrade O

zero O

so O
wonderful O

DELETED O
the O

This O
handy O
device O
solves O
that O
problem O
beautifully O
! O

So O
if O
your O
bag O
is O
sensitive O
to O
thickness O
, O
my O
metro O
bag O
was O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
something O
to O
consider O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
pen O
is O
as O
sensitive O
as O
that O
on O
the O
beefier O
Intuos O
tablets O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
important O
that O
would O
be O
if O
you O
're O
just O
using O
this O
tablet O
for O
casual O
use O
, O
as O
I O
intend O
to O
. O

Allowed O
me O
to O
mount O
my O
MAC O
mini O
server O
on O
the O
back O
of O
my O
24 O
inch O
monitor O
and O
save O
space O
. O

After O
a O
reboot O
, O
it O
would O
. O

The O
concept O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
USB O
port O
to O
plug O
in O
your O
device O
, O
but O
the O
execution O
just O
does O
n't O
happen O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
these O
do O
n't O
compare O
to O
my O
more O
expensive O
speakers O
I O
have O
hooked O
up O
at O
the O
office O
, O
but O
they O
sure O
come O
pretty O
close O
for O
most O
needs O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
just O
to O
have O
on O
hand O
in O
the O
future O
, O
not O
knowing O
how O
long O
this O
may O
last O
? O

Everything O
else O
is O
five O
stars O
! O

ALSO O
: O
I O
ended O
up O
going O
with O
this O
HP O
because O
normally O
, O
I O
've O
edited O
my O
MP3s O
and O
other O
music O
features O
with O
the O
media O
bundle O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
. O

I O
have O
since O
been O
out O
with O
it O
and O
very O
pleased O
on O
all O
accounts O
. O

, O
i O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
experince O
with O
Dells O
and O
i O
know O
how O
much O
they O
drain O
the O
batts O
due O
to O
high O
temps O
. O

I O
also O
stream O
Netflix O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
serve O
as O
the O
house O
laptop O
. O

If O
I O
were O
you O
, O
I O
'd O
purchase O
more O
than O
one O
brand O
, O
just O
to O
be O
sure O
you O
'll O
get O
one O
working O
convertor O
cable O
. O

It O
is O
absolutely O
unbelievable O
. O

Bought O
2 O
of O
this O
and O
the O
best O
feature O
( O
for O
the O
car O
) O
is O
that O
it O
allows O
phones O
to O
auto O
connect O
once O
the O
car O
starts O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
item O
, O
it O
replaces O
another O
cooling O
pad O
that O
I O
used O
that O
one O
of O
the O
fans O
started O
making O
noise O
so O
it O
got O
replaced O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
works O
perfect O
and O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
! O

It O
fits O
this O
well O
and O
the O
keyboard O
connects O
quickly O
without O
issue O
. O

I O
replaced O
a O
dead O
original O
battery O
with O
this O
battery O
. O

Both O
were O
in O
the O
same O
price O
range O
. O

You O
'd O
need O
to O
bungee O
harness O
your O
mobile O
device O
as O
well O
to O
make O
this O
work O
! O

It O
was O
the O
correct O
dimensions O
and O
fit O
perfectly O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
my O
new O
17 O
" O
unibody O
MacBook O
Pro O
intensively O
for O
over O
a O
week O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
have O
up O
to O
10 O
applications O
running O
at O
once O
and O
the O
speed O
is O
very O
good O
. O

To O
have O
a O
steelseries O
keyboard O
, O
ability O
to O
add O
2 O
msata O
drives O
and O
use O
their O
proprietary O
SuperRAID O
, O
Killer O
network O
, O
1080p O
, O
Matrix O
display O
( O
ability O
to O
have O
two O
external O
monitors O
and O
built O
in O
screen O
at O
the O
same O
time O
) O
just O
seemed O
to O
scratch O
the O
surface O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
unit O
for O
about O
a O
year O

I O
'm O
a O
little O
OCD O
about O
the O
smears O
on O
it O
and O
have O
to O
constantly O
wipe O
it O
off O
. O

I O
assumed O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
either O
incompatible O
with O
the O
Mac O
OS O
or O
because O
it O
would O
n't O
work O
with O
Google O
Voice O
. O

The O
size O
of O
this O
one O
is O
perfect O
to O
hold O
my O
camera O
body O
when O
mounted O
to O
my O
6 O
3/4 O
inch O
zoom O
- O
telephoto O
lens O
. O

I O
have O
considered O
sanding O
down O
the O
edges O
but O
hate O
to O
sand O
through O
the O
finish O
. O

I O
also O
got O
one O
last O
year O
, O
which O
has O
held O
up O
well O
, O
but O
when O
given O
the O
oppurtunity O
to O
review O
a O
new O
one O
I O
grabbed O
it O
up O
! O

sturdier O
- O
Price O
is O
just O
a O
little O
high O
( O
just O
my O
opinion O
) O

This O
unit O
is O
made O
in O
China O
. O

Clean O
, O
mostly O
neutral O
( O
slightly O
warmish O
) O
, O
with O
a O
good O
high O
end O
( O
a O
little O
rolled O
- O
off O
maybe O
? O
) O
, O
a O
fairly O
forward O
but O
engaging O
mid O
- O
range O
, O
and O
( O
what O
I O
think O
is O
) O
a O
fantastic O
( O
and O
I O
really O
mean O
FANTASTIC O
) O

I O
bought O
this O
in O
Jan O
2013 O
and O
used O
it O
non O
- O
stop O
to O
cool O
our O
wireless O
router O
. O

You O
can O
set O
up O
your O
display O
how O
you O
want O
, O
more O
space O
, O
larger O
text O
, O
or O
in O
between O
. O

It O
's O
OK O
, O
but O
personally O
I O
prefer O
smooth O
surfaces O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
expecting O
great O
quality O
on O
music O
, O
but O
I O
was O
hoping O
for O
at O
least O
decent O
quality O
for O
listening O
to O
podcasts O
-- O
no O
dice O
, O

Asus O
's O
answer O
was O
to O
return O
the O
computer O
... O
right O
like O
I O
can O
be O
without O
it O
for O
weeks O
... O

The O
light O
stays O
on O
in O
computer O
sleep O
mode O
and O
turns O
off O
only O
when O
the O
computer O
is O
turned O
off O
. O

This O
is O
the O
one O
to O
buy O
, O
the O
RETAIL O
BOXED O
SSD O
from O
Intel O
X25-M O
- O
Land O
! O

It O
would O
be O
perfect O
bedroom O
addition O
if O
it O
had O
a O
display O
with O
a O
clock O
radio O
function O
. O

Pushed O
the O
drive O
back O
onto O
the O
plug O
and O
it O
works O
. O

The O
speaker O
measures O
approximately O
4 O
. O
5 O
" O
x O
2 O
" O
x O
2 O
. O
25 O

There O
may O
be O
some O
way O
to O
adjust O
this O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
found O
it O
yet O
. O

But O
if O
your O
just O
a O
casual O
gamer O
and O
needing O
some O
extra O
space O
, O
this O
will O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

( O
I O
have O
n't O
broken O
my O
wife O
's O
yet)-There O

I O
had O
an O
issue O
similar O
to O
one O
noted O
by O
another O
review O
. O

( O
the O
light O
however O
stays O
on O
) O
. O

I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
cables O
, O
adapters O
, O
and O
other O
small O
do O
- O
dads O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
worried O
about O
portability O
with O
the O
massive O
antennas O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
an O
extremely O
good O
signal O
inside O
the O
house O
without O
either O
antenna O
attached O

cheap O
plastic O
parts O
( O
locking O
mechanism O
broke O
to O
gentle O
use O
within O
a O
month O
) O
blocks O
docking O
port O
when O
installeddied O
within O
three O
months O
( O
" O
return O
to O
manufacturer O
" O
error O
code O
, O
will O
not O
charge O
) O

Little O
uncomfortable O
in O
your O
hand O
. O

Anyway O
, O
in O
the O
interm O
, O
I O
returned O
the O
first O
battery O
in O
the O
Brilliant O
Store O
's O
prepaid O
packaging O
, O
and O
have O
kept O
this O
one O
for O
further O
evaluation O
. O

( O
I O
guess O
it O
could O
be O
smaller O
as O
a O
cube O
, O
but O
that O
's O
a O
rather O
awkward O
form O
factor O
to O
pack O
in O
a O
gadget O
bag.)3 O
. O

Plus O
, O
the O
flap O
itself O
is O
secured O
by O
a O
very O
large O
piece O
of O
velcro O
and O
two O
zippers O
, O
so O
it O
takes O
some O
effort O
just O
to O
get O
it O
open O
. O

Do O
n't O
know O
what O
else O
to O
say O
that O
has O
n't O
already O
been O
said O
by O
people O
who O
actually O
own O
one O
. O

Con O
You O
get O
1 O
- O
2 O
uses O
out O
of O
this O
. O

It O
is O
so O
much O
better O
than O
the O
leather O
strap O
soft O
briefcase O
that O
I O
carried O
for O
years O
, O
and O
caused O
me O
to O
leave O
my O
SLR O
at O
home O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

I O
'm O
sometimes O
willfully O
ignorant O
of O
the O
details O
of O
my O
work O
computers O
, O
so O
this O
review O
( O
for O
better O
or O
worse O
) O
will O
not O
be O
a O
super O
technical O
one O
focusing O
on O
specifications O
and O
related O
details O
. O

If O
you O
're O
a O
month O
in O
and O
you O
still O
have O
n't O
used O
the O
app O
, O
you O
can O
probably O
uninstall O
it O
. O

Within O
24 O
hours O
of O
receipt O
the O
optical O
drive O
failed O
! O
! O

I O
have O
a O
2 O
year O
old O
and O
a O
9 O
year O
old O
autistic O
child O
that O
share O
( O
using O
the O
term O
very O
loosely O
) O

You O
really O
need O
to O
hear O
this O
to O
believe O
it O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
use O
them O
on O
my O
lawnmower O
. O

Nothing O
really O
they O
could O
've O
done O
to O
prevent O
it O

I O
was O
having O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
heating O
up O
and O
, O
as O
I O
often O
balance O
it O
on O
my O
knees O
, O
getting O
too O
hot O
on O
my O
legs O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
because O
I O
had O
a O
need O
for O
using O
headphones O
with O
my O
laptop O
at O
work O
, O
and O
would O
need O
something O
easy O
to O
carry O
. O

Yep O
you O
guessed O
it O
good O
ole O
Windows O
XP O
. O

It O
worked O
well O
until O
the O
change O
. O

a O
lot O
of O
reviews O
about O
the O
touch O
pad O
was O
tuff O
to O
ignore O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
audio O
amounted O
to O
a O
huge O
processor O
load O
and O
wonder O
if O
this O
is O
n't O
some O
glitch O
that O
can O
be O
fixed-- O

I O
got O
these O
from O
another O
online O
retailer O
; O
they O
were O
an O
" O
open O
box O
" O
deal O
and O
about O
half O
price O
( O
nice!).I O
was O
upgrading O
from O
Creative O
T12 O
wired O
computer O
speakers O
. O

The O
keys O
took O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
but O
they O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

Even O
behind O
2 O
- O
3 O
walls O
, O
at O
least O
75 O
ft O
away O
, O
and O
in O
heavy O
rain O
or O
freezing O
cold O
, O
I O
consistently O
get O
3 O
- O
4 O
( O
out O
of O
5 O
) O
bars O
, O
low O
latency O
, O
and O
connections O
at O
150 O
- O
300Mbps O
@the O

so O
I O
would O
be O
less O
likely O
to O
leave O
it O
behind O
when O
I O
travel O
. O

It O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
apply O
too O
! O

This O
unit O
is O
NOT O
USB O
rechargeable O
but O
rather O
uses O
a O
external O
15v O
power O
brick O
like O
most O
laptop O
computers O
. O

I O
reported O
this O
to O
Amazon O
, O
which O
immediately O
sent O
a O
replacement O
next O
day O
delivery O
at O
no O
charge O
. O

com O
to O
see O
what O
the O
price O
would O
be O
there O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
did O
n't O
use O
this O
backpack O
to O
tote O
your O
17 O
" O
marvel O
of O
technology O
around O
, O
it O
would O
serve O
well O
as O
a O
camper O
/ O
hiker O
backpack O
. O

Despite O
the O
official O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
a O
Class O
6 O
card O
, O
it O
only O
wrote O
at O
4 O
. O
7 O
MB O
per O
second O
, O
meaning O
it O
is O
actually O
a O
Class O
4 O
card O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
good O
, O
the O
few O
times O
it O
worked O
. O

Would O
definitely O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
saw O
that O
Acer O
was O
selling O
refurbished O
C720s O
for O
$ O
150 O
and O
that O
got O
my O
attention O
. O

With O
the O
computer O
freezing O
up O
, O
and O
my O
wife O
not O
being O
able O
to O
read O
that O
awful O
color O
combination O
, O
I O
returned O
the O
MBP O
. O

I O
have O
to O
use O
a O
rubber O
band O
to O
hold O
it O
firmly O
in O
the O
socket O
. O

Connector O
has O
a O
great O
fit O
and O
the O
unit O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
run O
hot O
like O
others O
I O
've O
purchased O
for O
various O
laptops O
. O

Samsung O
seriously O
delivered O
here O
. O

This O
feature O
has O
to O
be O
turned O
on O
via O
software O
settings O
; O
it O
is O
disabled O
by O
default O
. O

gave O
it O
to O
him O
for O
free O
since O
it O
did O
nt O
fit O
my O
keyboard O
. O

Remember O
- O
PSUs O
do O
not O
adjust O
their O
fan O
speed O
according O
to O
heat O
( O
unless O
you O
have O
a O
special O
method O
to O
do O
this O
) O
, O
but O
by O
power O
draw O
. O

I O
use O
it O
on O
my O
tablet O
, O
smartphone O
and O
laptop O
( O
it O
has O
a O
glass O
overlay O
on O
the O
screen O
) O
. O

I O
like O
that O
choice O
by O
Apple O
. O

There O
is O
bluetooth O
support O
, O
and O
you O
absolutely O
can O
hook O
up O
an O
external O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O

Boy O
am O
I O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
4 O
DVD O
's O
for O
the O
Recovery O
disks O
and O
your O
good O
to O
go O
. O

I O
stream O
Netflix O
and O
Hulu O
everyday O
and O
never O
have O
an O
issue O
. O

Where O
one O
side O
of O
the O
handle O
connects O
to O
the O
body O
became O
badly O
frayed O
; O
if O
it O
had O
continued O
, O
that O
side O
of O
the O
handle O
would O
have O
become O
detached O
. O

developers O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
last O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O

About O
1 O
1/2 O
times O
the O
size O
of O
an O
iphone O
. O

While O
I O
prefer O
metal O
D O
- O
rings O
instead O
of O
plastic O
D O
- O
rings O
for O
durability O
, O
I O
really O
dislike O
these O
kinds O
of O
plastic O
shoulder O
strap O
clips O
when O
used O
on O
a O
briefcase O
that O
is O
carrying O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
laptop O
( O
and O
tablet O
) O
. O

One O
gripe O
unrelated O
to O
performance O
: O
the O
curved O
" O
head O
" O
of O
these O
things O
is O
just O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
wide O
side O
. O

I O
bought O
three O
of O
these O
. O

Initially O
I O
tried O
using O
the O
intel O
tool O
to O
clone O
my O
primary O
drive O
in O
my O
laptop O
. O

The O
other O
reviews O
of O
this O
bag O
reflect O
what O
I O
find O
to O
be O
its O
strong O
and O
weak O
points O
. O

, O
my O

, O
my O

EVERYTHING O

I O
wanted O
a O
good O
and O
effective O
way O
to O
neatly O
store O
items O
in O
my O
Thule O
carrier O

Luckily O
, O
his O
laptop O
still O
worked O
fine O
due O
to O
the O
padding O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
but O
in O
any O
case O
, O
dropping O
an O
expensive O
laptop O
is O
not O
a O
comfortable O
feeling O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
that O
some O
of O
the O
features O
I O
enjoyed O
with O
my O
old O
bag O
were O
not O
included O
. O

After O
a O
few O
months O
of O
use O
the O
connection O
to O
the O
computer O
would O
slip O
and O
I O
had O
to O
fiddle O
with O
it O
to O
get O
it O
to O
make O
a O
good O
connection O
. O

It O
even O
has O
the O
metal O
outside O
finish O
that O
looks O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
. O

But O
this O
unit O
kept O
getting O
hot O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
thicker O
and O
longer O
, O
providing O
greater O
charging O
flexibility O
. O

Big O
deal O
. O

Just O
pay O
50 O
bucks O
to O
a O
local O
computer O
store O
if O
you O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
buy O
this O
. O

It O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
my O
& O
# O
34;personal&#34 O
; O
bag O
and O
will O
go O
under O
the O
seat O
in O
the O
plane O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
some O
of O
the O
reviewers O
have O
noticed O
that O
. O

so O
I O
knew O
a O
real O
network O
problem O
was O
unlikely O
. O

So O
trying O
to O
use O
this O
with O
a O
Mac O
computer O
connected O
to O
my O
TV O
was O
an O
exercise O
in O
frustration O
. O

It O
responds O
quickly O
when O
in O
use O
and O
quietly O
naps O
when O
not O
in O
use O
, O
Awakes O
instantly O
when O
needed O
and O
agile O
as O
you O
scroll O
through O
a O
page O
. O

It O
does O
not O
hold O
a O
charge O
that O
long O
( O
maximum O
of O
2 O
hours O
) O
which O
is O
a O
disappointment O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
much O
silent O
in O
operation O

If O
ever O
you O
by O
chance O

Once O
turned O
on O
, O
I O
then O
had O
the O
option O
to O
use O
DHCP O
( O
Dynamic O
IP O

or O
a O
fixed O

I O
had O
to O
keep O
my O
bags O
down O
to O
three O
that O
I O
could O
carry O
some O
distance O
, O
and O
my O
wife O
was O
limited O
to O
three O
as O
well O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
paired O
it O
with O
my O
Samsung O
Note O

Seems O
like O
it O
is O
good O
quality O

I O
am O
speechless O
about O
this O
item O
. O

The O
full O
complaint O
is O
this O
: O
The O
plug O
has O
a O
LED O
that O
shines O
when O
the O
unit O
is O
plugged O
in O
to O
a O
live O

the O

It O
also O
lifts O
the O

Thanks O
Anker O
, O
I O
am O
a O
very O
satisfied O
customer O
! O

I O
was O
able O
to O
transfer O
Office O
2007 O
from O
the O
HP O
over O
to O
this O
machine O
resulting O
in O
* O
more O
* O
updates O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
product O
for O
a O
user O
who O
wants O
to O
do O
e O
- O
mail O
, O
browse O
the O
internet O
, O
listen O
to O
podcasts O
, O
download O
audio O
books O
, O
and O
run O
applications O
like O
personal O
finance O
software O
and O
who O
also O
wants O
a O
small O
easily O
portable O
computer O
to O
handles O
these O
things O
. O

1 O
tablet O
and O
also O
carry O
my O
Logitech O

I O
give O
it O
two O
stars O
for O
form O
, O
sleekness O
, O
and O
it O
's O
low O
profile O
. O

I O
got O
this O
computer O
today O
and O
since O
then O
, O
I O
've O
been O
playing O
games O
on O
it O
nonstop O
. O

Get O
it O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O
five O
jiggahertz O
wireless O
card O
, O
it O
'll O
go O
Sonic O
the O
Hedgehog O
speed O
. O

Will O
update O
my O
post O
later O
if O
I O
find O
some O
flaw O
with O
it O
, O
but O
out O
of O
the O
box O
it O
worked O
fine O
, O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
read O
the O
directions O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
there O
is O
a O
LOT O
of O
room O
in O
this O
bag O
. O

but O
it O
takes O
up O
so O
little O
room O
that O
I O
did O
leave O
it O
in O
the O
pocket O
in O
which O
it O
was O
originally O
stowed O
. O

I O
brought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
to O
record O
some O
family O
history O
on O
her O
PC O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
easily O
snap O
into O
place O
, O
or O
at O
least O
not O
as O
easily O
as O
the O
original O
batter O
. O

You O
see O
yourself O
either O
way O
, O
might O
as O
well O
get O
the O
better O
picture O
! O

I O
know O
there O
is O
one O
just O
because O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
went O
from O
wired O
to O
wireless O
but O
internet O
speed O
wise O
there O
was O
no O
difference O
. O

I O
love O
this O
netbook O
. O

Seems O
secure O
, O
weighs O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
notebook O
, O
not O
by O
much O
, O
though O
. O

That O
is O
1/2 O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
new O
camera O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
much O
better O
than O
a O
notebook O
and O
really O
makes O
a O
nice O
difference O
. O

This O
will O
do O
the O
job O
unless O
you O
have O
3 O
feet O
of O
Krell O
steel O
between O
the O
laptop O
's O
location O
and O
your O
router O
! O

I O
've O
been O
carrying O
one O
of O
these O
around O
in O
my O
bag O
as O
my O
hotel O
entertainment O
center O
. O

I O
returned O
and O
received O
credit O
. O

I O
'd O
also O
like O
to O
say O
that O
I O
own O
5 O
computers O
( O
counting O
my O
wife O
's O
) O
including O
an O
HP O
, O
a O
custom O
built O
gaming O
computer O
, O
and O
even O
an O
Apple O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

i O
get O
comments O
all O
the O
time O
on O
how O
awsome O
the O
machine O
looks O

I O
had O
two O
original O
Apple O
packs O
swell O
up O
and O
fail O
, O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
see O
a O
downside O
to O
trying O
a O
third O
party O
... O

I O
travel O
internationally O
with O
it O
and O
it O
held O
up O
well O
so O
far O
. O

The O
4 O
GB O
was O
just O
enough O
room O
to O
get O
everything O
on O
it O
. O

This O
makes O
it O
extremely O
difficult O
to O
point O
accurately O
if O
the O
thing O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
point O
at O
is O
near O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
trackpad O
. O

Very O
nice O
item O
. O

, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
find O
this O
annoying O

so O
your O
fingers O
do O
n't O
still O
touch O
the O
screen O
. O

The O
memory O
worked O
really O
well O
. O

I O
have O
received O
tons O
of O
compliments O
on O
the O
bag O
, O
with O
people O
commenting O
that O
it O
looks O
very O
well O
- O
made O
and O
guess O
that O
it O
cost O
( O
way O
) O
more O
than O
it O
did O
. O

The O
device O
has O
a O
proprietary O
connection O
for O
charging O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
best O
suited O
for O
a O
14"-15 O
" O
laptop O
. O

I O
am O
using O
AKG O
702 O
, O
Beyerdynamic O
770 O
, O
880 O
, O
990 O
, O
Sennheiser O
PXC O
450 O
, O
HD O
598 O
. O

So O
far O
eBay O
was O
the O
only O
place O
I O
could O
find O
an O
IDE O
50 O
pin O
to O
USB O
optical O
enclosure O
that O
does O
support O
Blu O
Ray O
drives O
. O

I O
'm O
loathe O
to O
spend O
the O
$ O
50 O
Tivo O
wants O
for O
their O
adapter O
-- O

The O
sleeve O
is O
well O
made O
with O
a O
solid O
zipper O
and O
interior O
cushioning O
to O
protect O
the O
MacBook O
from O
scratches O
and O
light O
bumps O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
sized O
bag O
for O
it O
, O
and O
there O
's O
enough O
room O
for O
a O
little O
mouse O
and O
my O
flash O
drive O
case O
in O
the O
second O
pocket O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
the O
Alfas O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
, O
and O
the O
Sabrent O
is O
a O
nice O
, O
low O
- O
cost O
alternative O
providing O
you O
replace O
the O
antenna O
. O

The O
biggest O
con O
is O
that O
many O
public O
wifi O
places O
are O
not O
supported O
for O
the O
Chromebook O
therefor O
most O
schools O
and O
many O
work O
places O
will O
prevent O
your O
Chromebook O
from O
working O
. O

lbs O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
lug O
around O
in O
a O
backpack O
all O
day O
. O

MacBook O
( O
Late O
2008 O
Model O
) O

It O
does O
n't O
clean O
as O
well O
as O
just O
a O
microfiber O
cloth O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
well O
it O
would O
work O
in O
protecting O
my O
Air O
from O
drops O
or O
other O
forces O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
protector O
for O
their O
macbook O
and O
it O
sure O
prevents O
scratches O
, O
dings O
, O
etc O
... O
get O
you O
one O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
complain O
about O
the O
missing O
parts O
to O
the O
distributer O

The O
original O
battery O
was O
about O
three O
years O
old O
and O
refused O
to O
take O
a O
charge O
. O

Their O
own O
support O
forums O
are O
overflowing O
with O
people O
reporting O
this O
problem O
: O
[ O
... O

The O
size O
is O
very O
practical O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

So O
load O
, O
carrying O
my O
laptop O
to O
say O
class O
just O
is O
n't O
a O
viable O
option O
because O
their O
is O
no O
doubt O
it O
will O
be O
too O
big O
of O
a O
distraction O
. O

After O
two O
weeks O
of O
fairly O
heavy O
use O
, O
I O
can O
say O
I O
am O
entirely O
pleased O
with O
this O
machine O
. O

Other O
things O
equal O
, O
solid O
state O
is O
faster O
than O
a O
hard O
disk O
. O

When O
I O
replaced O
it O
with O
my O
old O
Tenda O
adapter O
, O
the O
connection O
was O
solid O
. O

The O
side O
pocket O
even O
has O
room O
for O
my O
MS O
Arc O
Touch O
Mouse O
and O
my O
Nexus O
7 O
in O
a O
Cruzerlite O
TPU O
case O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
with O
my O
kindle O
for O
a O
couple O
months O
and O
could O
not O
be O
more O
pleased O
. O

Somewhat O
better O
speed O
than O
Atom O
( O
much O
better O
than O
low O
- O
end O
single O
core O
Atom O
) O

I O
sent O
it O
in O
because O
of O
the O
severe O
keyboard O
clank O
and O
flex O
. O

and O
then O
it O
tried O
to O
connect O
but O
failed O
. O

okay O
well O
never O
mind O
about O
the O
friend O
thing O
but O
seriously O
all O
in O
all O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O

At O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
this O
review O
, O
I O
do O
not O
see O
that O
the O
hub O
's O
dimensions O
are O
listed O
anywhere O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
padded O
carry O
case O
for O
my O
new O
ipad O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
glad O
that O
I O
chose O
this O
one O
. O

The O
TV O
came O
with O
a O
cheap O
antenea O
but O
this O
one O
if O
rugged O
and O
should O
last O
. O

I O
like O
the O
edge O
feature O
, O
two O
stops O
you O
can O
easily O
snap O
into O
place O
and O
holds O
the O
laptop O
on O
the O
device O
securely O
. O

Will O
protect O
it O
from O
scratching O
, O
helping O
to O
keep O
the O
value O
of O
the O
machine O
. O

This O
is O
an O
expensive O
web O
browser O
that O
can O
not O
play O
YouTube O
without O
hickups O
. O

This O
time O
, O
though O
, O
I O
looked O
around O
for O
something O
to O
protect O
it O
more O
and O
after O
some O
looking O
and O
reading O
and O
even O
some O
product O
testing O
in O
stores O
, O
I O
thought O
this O
would O
do O
the O
trick O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
had O
plenty O
of O
fits O
trying O
to O
get O
this O
set O
up O
for O
my O
teenage O
son O
, O
due O
to O
Windows O
8 O
. O

Bulky O
and O
heavyThe O
phone O
is O
too O
big O
and O
heavy O
. O

The O
JBL O
speakers O
produce O
great O
loud O
sound O
, O
no O
distortion O
( O
so O
far O
) O
. O

Of O
course O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
and O
the O
next O
day O

There O
is O
not O
much O
to O
say O
about O
a O
replacement O
power O
cord O
, O
except O
that O
it O
has O
been O
charging O
my O
wife O
's O
acer O
aspire O
one O
netbook O
for O
3 O
weeks O
now O
. O

You O
will O
be O
more O
than O
happy O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
still O
superior O
to O
anything O
running O
Windows O
. O

My O
satellite O
ISP O
turned O
my O
service O
off O
, O
thanks O
to O
using O
the O
webcam O
. O

and O
I O
use O
this O
bag O
solely O
for O
storage O
of O
my O
5DMKII O
at O
home O
. O

It O
was O
so O
good O
that O
I O
waited O
until O
this O
cover O
was O
available O
for O
the O
Kindle O
Touch O
. O

It O
's O
a O
flash O
card O
, O
what O
is O
there O
to O
say O
about O
it O
? O

Plugged O
it O
in O
, O
logged O
on O
to O
WiFi O
and O
have O
not O
had O
any O
problems O
. O

ONLY O
THEN O
you O
should O
install O
WIndows O
8 O
. O

You O
do O
not O
need O
to O
install O
anything O
! O

Lots O
of O
the O
right O
features O
and O
great O
build O
. O

Great O
battery O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
some O
people O
say O
that O
it O
's O
not O
large O
enough O
for O
a O
19 O
" O
, O
but O
it O
's O
plenty O
large O
with O
room O
to O
spare O
. O

After O
initially O
paring O
this O
keyboard O
activates O
when O
turned O
on O
and O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
my O
tablet O
instantly O
, O
this O
keyboard O
is O
fantastic O

I O
finally O
decided O
maybe O
it O
would O
be O
fun O
to O
try O
to O
root O
the O
device O
and O
see O
if O
that O
offers O
any O
additional O
functionality O
. O

Shorter O
would O
be O
great O
next O
to O
my O
bed O
when O
I O
plug O
in O
my O
phone O
at O
night O
, O
or O
when O
I O
connect O
my O
phone O
to O
my O
laptop O
. O

The O
components O
feel O
cheap O
, O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
for O
the O
cord O
to O
double O
back O
on O
itself O
which O
is O
easily O
remedied O
, O
but O
for O
a O
cheap O
device O
it O
is O
appropriate O
. O

Looks O
ugly O

Arrived O
promptly O
, O
packaged O
well O
and O
in O
great O
shape O
. O

It O
is O
HUGE O
on O
my O
tiny O
wife O
, O
but O
for O
me O
it O
is O
great O

And O
it O
plays O
videos O
from O
youtube O
with O
no O
hitches O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
little O
dongle O
has O
performed O
well O
, O
paring O
to O
my O
cellphone O
, O
Vizio O
sound O
bar O
and O
other O
devices O
. O

There O
were O
no O
dead O
or O
stuck O
pixels O
. O

The O
battery O
slowly O
degraded O
over O
the O
following O
months O
, O
and O
two O
weeks O
ago O
it O
would O
n't O
hold O
a O
charge O
over O
47%.Today O
, O
after O
finally O
getting O
through O
to O
customer O
service O
after O
a O
30 O
minute O
hold O
time O
today O
, O
I O
was O
told O
by O
the O
first O
tier O
tech O
, O
the O
senior O
engineer O
, O
and O
his O
support O
manager O
that O
" O
batteries O
are O
a O
consumable O
, O
and O
only O
last O
about O
a O
year O
. O
" O

It O
is O
a O
very O
useful O
machine O
, O
provided O
you O
are O
n't O
expecting O
the O
above O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
dongle O
so O
that O
I O
could O
tether O
my O
Windows O
8 O

Though O
I O
am O
sure O
this O
was O
designed O
for O
a O
laptop O
in O
mind O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
the O
comparative O
lack O
of O
keys O
. O

Hoping O
to O
place O
another O
order O
with O
same O
seller O
but O
different O
listing O
cost O
4 O
91 O
as O
people O
indicate O
the O
adapter O
they O
received O
for O
this O
listing O
came O
with O
the O
90 O
degree O
adapter O
pin O
. O

I O
am O
used O
to O
my O
Droid O
X O
, O
so O
it O
may O
just O
be O
lie O
when O
I O
first O
used O
Windows O
Vista O
. O

Way O
to O
go O
Toshiba O
! O

This O
thing O
ca O
n't O
play O
games O
, O
ca O
n't O
play O
iTunes O
, O
ca O
n't O
do O
almost O
all O
thing O
you O
would O
think O
a O
laptop O
should O
do O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
transfer O
photos O
from O
my O
smart O
media O
card O
to O
an O
SD O
card O
. O

works O
very O
well O
. O

Would O
buy O
again O
if O
I O
had O
the O
need O
to O
. O

Honestly O
, O
the O
name O
Case O
Logic O
has O
never O
screamed O
high O
end O
to O
me O
, O
but O
this O
bag O
screams O
high O
end O
. O

It O
takes O
up O
a O
USB O
port O
, O
not O
allowing O
piggybacking O
, O
so O
if O
you O
have O
an O
older O
laptop O
with O
only O
one O
or O
two O
USB O
ports O
this O
could O
be O
an O
issue O
. O

I O
bought O
one O
of O
the O
disc O
- O
requiring O
batteries O
awhile O
back O
and O
, O
scared O
off O
by O
the O
sketchy O
- O
looking O
BIOS O
flasher O
, O
opted O
to O
pull O
the O
battery O
cells O
and O
wire O
them O
into O
the O
old O
case O
, O
using O
the O
old O
pcb O
contained O
within O
. O

and O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
many O
months O
now O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
so O
that O
I O
can O
utilize O
a O
low O
cost O
high O
quality O
bluetooth O
headphones O
that O
frees O
me O
from O
the O
wired O
headphones O
without O
paying O
too O
much O
for O
a O
wireless O
headphone O
or O
dealing O
with O
such O
bulky O
material O
.. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
computer O
networking O
and O
wireless O
connections O

The O
5-led O
button O
on O
the O
battery O
actually O
clicks O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
click O
. O

my O
OEM O
adapter O
for O
my O
Inspiron O
1440 O
failed O
just O
before O
finals O
, O
overnighted O
this O
for O
next O
to O
nothing O
and O
it O
has O
been O
kicking O
away O
ever O
since O
. O

1 O
) O
Crummy O
low O
- O
resolution O
screen O
. O

There O
are O
.dll O
files O
that O
will O
crop O
up O
and O
could O
easily O
freeze O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
constant O
plugging O
and O
unplugging O
to O
get O
this O
device O
to O
work O
properly O
seems O
harmful O
to O
the O
USB O
interface O
as O
well O
as O
the O
drive O
pins O
and O
the O
drive O
disk O
itself O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
jarring O
. O

Replace O
the O
new O
ribbon O
exactly O
as O
the O
old O
one O
was O
seated O
, O
seat O
the O
retaining O
clip O
and O
you O
should O
be O
ready O
to O
go O
! O

The O
padding O
is O
adjustable O
and O
thick O
but O
there O
is O
tons O
of O
space O
for O
a O
simple O
camera O
setup O
, O
and O
a O
laptop O
or O
a O
few O
books O
. O

The O
sound O
( O
whether O
in O
an O
urban O
area O
or O
way O
out O
in O
the O
sticks O
) O
is O
noisy O
, O
distorted O
, O
and O
compressed O
, O
even O
when O
there O
are O
no O
local O
interfering O
stations O
. O

The O
padding O
offers O
up O
some O
nice O
protection O
for O
your O
devices O
as O
well O
. O

With O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
this O
thing O
becomes O
a O
man O
- O
purse O
. O

When O
I O
am O
not O
on O
the O
go O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
have O
a O
simple O
hook O
- O
up O
and O
have O
access O
to O
my O
17 O
" O
flat O
panel O
monitor O
, O
printer O
, O
keyboard O
, O
iTouch O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
the O
manufacturer O
allowed O
this O
to O
happen O
or O
if O
mine O
is O
just O
defective O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
huge O
problem O
if O
you O
have O
nice O
clothing O
. O

I O
placed O
the O
receiver O
on O
the O
wall O
below O
the O
TV O
and O
the O
red O
feedback O

but O
there O
is O
excess O
plastic O
on O
the O
wheel O
and O
you O
can O
almost O
hear O
it O
creak O
. O

Although O
the O
device O
is O
suitable O
for O
the O
uses O
it O
implies O
, O
has O
the O
correct O
tips O
for O
the O
devices O
it O
claims O
to O
support O
, O
and O
has O
voltage O
settings O
that O
are O
within O
the O
range O
of O
any O
of O
the O
ones O
listed O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
technically O
be O
set O
for O
some O
of O
the O
voltages O
listed O
. O

One O
caveat O
for O
Windows O
8/8 O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
new O
one O
and O
I O
love O
it O
. O

Plugged O
it O
into O
the O
Personal O
Drive O
Bay O
( O
shoved O
it O
in O
) O
and O
did O
the O
format O
. O

I O
have O
always O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
Samsung O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
Asus O
UL30A O
, O
Acer O
Timeline O
3810 O
, O
Lenovo O
U350 O
, O
and O
Toshiba O
T135 O
( O
other O
laptops O
in O
the O
DM3 O
's O
category O
) O
, O
I O
would O
rank O
the O
HP O
DM3 O
as O
a O
close O
3rd O
to O
the O
Acer O
Timeline O
3810 O
. O

the O
picture O
is O
clear O
and O
the O
video O
is O
even O
better O
. O

To O
the O
novice O
readers O
, O
those O
two O
companies O
are O
the O
brain O
power O
of O
the O
industry O
. O

This O
screen O
will O
be O
the O
most O
significant O
reason O
why O
I O
finally O
retire O
my O
Powerbook O
and O
probably O
get O
an O
Air O
. O

This O
was O
a O
pain O
until O
I O
just O
stuck O
a O
hardcover O
book O
in O
one O
of O
the O
front O
- O
most O
pockets O
to O
keep O
it O
from O
being O
able O
to O
bend O
. O

One O
other O
thing O
. O

I O
added O
these O
to O
my O
tablet O
/ O
keyboard O
combo O
( O
ASUS O
TF700 O
T O
) O
so O
the O
keyboard O
sits O
at O
a O
slight O
angle O
. O

We O
were O
looking O
for O
inexpensive O
laptops O
that O
could O
be O
used O
for O
the O
multitude O
of O
games O
they O
play O
. O

Was O
pretty O
much O
a O
plug O
and O
play O
. O

You O
blew O
it O
on O
this O
one O
guys O
. O

I O
had O
read O
the O
questions O
and O
answers O
regarding O
this O
laptop O
prior O
to O
purchasing O
it O
. O

I O
will O
update O
this O
after O
I O
have O
had O
some O
time O
with O
it O
. O

My O
daughter O
got O
this O
for O
me O
for O
Fathers O
day O

The O
LED O
lit O
screen O
is O
bright O
and O
details O
are O
good O
. O

The O
trackpoint O
does O
unpredictable O
things O
if O
you O
rest O
your O
wrists O
on O
it O
while O
typing O
. O

but O
it O
is O
not O
big O
enough O
. O

So O
somewhat O
less O
than O
advertised O
. O

I O
dealt O
with O
that O
only O
because O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
laptop O
already O
, O
and O
while O
the O
keyboard O
does O
n't O
annoy O
me O
right O
now O
( O
got O
used O
to O
it O
) O
, O
it O
will O
annoy O
other O
people O
in O
the O
beginning O
. O

This O
laptop O
sleeve O
has O
ample O
room O
for O
my O
13 O
" O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

It O
replaced O
a O
5 O
year O
old O
original O
Dell O
battery O
in O
a O
Dell O
Inspiron O
laptop O
. O

I O
love O
Samsung O
electronics O
and O
they O
are O
fast O
becoming O
the O
leader O
in O
quality O
products O
. O

they O
were O
shipped O
separately O
. O

There O
is O
one O
problem O
. O

They O
work O
great O
& O
come O
in O
a O
nice O
box O
. O

Great O
idea O
. O

I O
love O
the O
setting O
up O
of O
the O
system O
. O

When O
you O
plug O
in O
the O
Archos O
it O
starts O
automatically O
. O

As O
for O
form O
, O
it O
's O
quite O
attractive O
. O

For O
a O
lark O
, O
I O
tried O
my O
phone O
running O
Android O
2 O
. O

The O
item O
also O
arrived O
on O
time O
, O
and O
the O
company O
's O
customer O
service O
is O
among O
the O
best O
that O
I O
have O
come O
across O
thus O
far O
. O

My O
Apple O
device O
sits O
nicely O
on O
this O
well O
designed O
platform O
. O

I O
tried O
everything O
I O
could O
think O
of O
. O

The O
11&#34 O
; O
model O
fits O
an O
Alienware O
m11x O
really O
well O
, O
but O
that O
's O
all O
i O
can O
say O
to O
commend O
it O
. O

Never O
has O
any O
task O
, O
such O
as O
starting O
an O
application O
or O
opening O
a O
file O
ever O
been O
bogged O
down.- O

In O
the O
picture O
it O
is O
, O
but O
what O
arrived O
is O
the O
same O
- O
NOT O
A O
US O
ENGLISH O
KEYBOARD O
. O

The O
touch O
screen O
is O
very O
responsive O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
still O
using O
my O
regular O
mouse O
. O

The O
soft O
cloth O
is O
larger O
than O
the O
cloth O
that O
comes O
with O
most O
cleaner O
kits O
. O

A O
salesperson O
told O
me O
that O
G O
- O
Tech O
drives O
generally O
are O
for O
business O
, O
and O
that O
this O
drive O
is O
a O
high O
- O
end O
consumer O
product O
. O

Great O
for O
plugging O
a O
USB O
memory O
stick O
to O
quickly O
swap O
files O
with O
a O
friend O
! O

but O
this O
was O
the O
best O
purchase O
for O
a O
laptop O
! O

Unfortunately O
they O
cheaped O
out O
and O
provide O
very O
little O
current O
to O
the O
USB O
. O

" O
Monitorto O
my O
work O
setup O
( O
it O
's O
become O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
sickness O
, O
I O
know O
) O
. O

Perfect O
fit O
- O
I O
'm O
always O
amazed O
by O
how O
well O
this O
Speck O
case O
fits O
and O
literally O
just O
snaps O
onto O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
using O
just O
several O
small O
tabs O
that O
protrude O
ever O
so O
slightly O
in O
strategic O
locations O
that O
one O
can O
barely O
notice O
. O

this O
fit O
my O
dv1000 O
perfectly O
. O

Easy O
, O
intuitive O
, O
solid O
quality O
equipment O
. O

Love O
Apple O
's O
OS O
, O
but O
the O
laptop O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
use O
a O
DSLR O
camera O

Works O
perfect O
with O
Skype O
, O
Steam O
, O
Google O
Hangouts O
, O
and O
whatever O
other O
programs O
that O
use O
a O
mic O
. O

This O
is O
a O
simple O
and O
clear O
signal O
that O
charging O
is O
over O
! O

do O
you O
really O
need O
to O
purchase O
another O

... O

It O
does O
hold O
it O
in O
the O
inside O

if O
I O
remove O
the O
inner O
case O
. O

That O
might O
affect O
a O
person O
's O
perception O
of O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
speakers O
. O

It O
has O
definitely O
made O
a O
noticeable O
difference O
in O
the O
response O
speed O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Chromebook O
and O
the O
first O
one O
that O
I O
bought O
new O
. O

Looks O
ok O
even O
though O
it O
seems O
a O
little O
cheap O
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
this O
as O
it O
was O
cheap O
, O
reviews O
were O
good O
and O
USB O
wirless O

I O
use O
mine O
mainly O
for O
my O
smartphone O
. O

I O
tried O
inserting O
the O
Samsung O
drive O
into O
a O
Sabrent O
case O
BK-210S2 O
& O
# O
8211 O
; O
another O
$ O
14 O
and O
use O
the O
CD O
which O
came O
with O
the O
Samsung O
disk O
& O
# O
8211 O
; O
Samsung O
Magic O
to O
do O
this O
task O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
there O
is O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
local O
storage O
on O
the O
device O
. O

This O
could O
be O
a O
real O
problem O
if O
you O
are O
wanting O
to O
put O
it O
in O
a O
bag O
or O
pack O
. O

but O
I O
ca O
n't O
speak O
with O
him O
" O
. O

and O
it O
is O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
be O
bothersome O
. O

The O
front O
pocket O
has O
slots O
for O
pencils O
and O
other O
accessories O
. O

It O
was O
the O
proper O
thing O
for O
the O
machine O
and O
it O
functioned O
pretty O
well O
. O

SAY O
ANYTHNG O
MOREI O
DONT O
LIKE O
THIS O

The O
HP O
boots O
in O
less O
time O
than O
it O
took O
my O
old O
computer O
to O
came O
out O
of O
sleep O
mode O
. O

My O
advice O
would O
be O
that O
if O
you O
just O
want O
somthing O
to O
draw O
and O
do O
sketching O
on O
the O
computer O
this O
is O
alright O

( O
I O
prefer O
a O
mouse O

I O
really O
love O
it O
. O

This O
is O
an O
affordable O
way O
to O
connect O
your O
midi O
- O
keyboard O
to O
your O
sequencer O
. O

Looks O
great O
, O
fits O
well O
and O
most O
importantly O
it O
protects O
my O
MBA O
. O

Those O
that O
are O
an O
exception O
, O
such O
as O
the O
MSI O
or O
the O
Samsung O
do O
not O
have O
the O
same O
tactile O
feeling O
. O

The O
GUI O
display O
indicates O
there O
are O
cameras O
sending O
signals O
but O
there O
is O
no O
video O
. O

Since O
it O
actually O
works O
to O
power O
the O
computer O
, O
I O
probably O
wo O
n't O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
to O
return O
it O
, O
especially O
since O
I O
need O
the O
adapter O

I O
love O
this O
mini O
speaker O
. O

Does O
n't O
cover O
the O
very O
back O
though O
which O
is O
weird O
. O

So O
I O
started O
movie O
again O

it O
's O
a O
thing.)Why O
three O
stars O
? O

Great O

( O
My O

" O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
the O
2 O

9 O

i7 O
model O
, O
and O
my O
MacBook O

is O
factory O
upgraded O
to O
a O

0 O
GHz O
i7 O

and O
8 O

using O
the O
two O
machines O
side O
- O
by O
- O
side O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
now O
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
outperforms O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
in O
almost O
every O
task O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
overall O
speed O
and O
performance O
. O

so O
.. O
good O
to O
keep O
that O
all O
in O
mind O
. O

I O
knew O
returns O
would O
be O
easy O
if O
I O
was O
n't O
satisfied O
with O
it O
. O

When O
doing O
a O
lot O
of O
photo O
processing O
I O
found O
that O
the O
WiFi O
would O
disconnect O
. O

It O
is O
now O
working O
good O
- O
we O
'll O
see O
. O

its O
works O
fine O
as O
is O
but O
if O
not O
careful O
opening O
filters O
can O
slide O
out O
. O

The O
very O
stiff O
speed O
wheel O
needs O
to O
be O
change O
to O
maybe O
a O
slide O
switch O
, O
i O
nearly O
broke O
mine O
trying O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
. O

One O
note O
: O

I O
use O
it O
on O
Windows O
7 O
, O
Vista O
, O
and O
even O
XP O
, O
same O
story O
, O
plug O
it O
in O
, O
it O
is O
recognized O
and O
off O
you O
go O
. O

I O
love O
the O

As O
long O
as O
there O
is O
a O

of O

path O
from O
the O

seemed O
to O
be O
no O
problem O
... O
pint O
the O
remote O
at O
an O
off O
angle O
at O
a O
reflective O
surface O
. O

On O
the O
opposite O
side O
is O
another O
pocket O
with O
two O
outer O
small O
pockets O
for O
accessories O
. O

First O
impression O
was O
WOW O
it O
can O
see O
everyones O
network O
! O

If O
you O
're O
a O
professional O
photographer O
who O
relies O
on O
their O
Powerbook O
to O
work O
and O
make O
money O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
your O
job O
will O
be O
greatly O
obstructed O
and O
you O
will O
become O
frustrated O
with O
this O
growing O
problem O
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
it O
would O
be O
a O
cheap O
imitation O
, O
but O
they O
are O
n't O
. O

Amazon O
probably O
does O
not O
have O
the O
newer O
version O
fully O
plugged O
in O
yet O
as O
Belkin O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
just O
released O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
benefit O
to O
me O
, O
as O
my O
previous O
computer O
backpack O
had O
a O
few O
big O
compartments O
, O
rather O
than O
separate O
pockets O
-- O
everything O
would O
get O
tangled O
, O
and O
then O
spill O
out O
in O
a O
heap O
once O
opened O
. O

It O
's O
meant O
for O
streamlined O
transport O
, O
so O
although O
you O
can O
fit O
additional O
items O
like O
a O
cord O
or O
notebook O
, O
it O
's O
better O
in O
the O
long O
run O
to O
use O
a O
separate O
bag O
or O
pocket O
to O
carry O
the O
bulkier O
items O
. O

Still O
, O
this O
did O
n't O
create O
too O
big O
a O
problem O
for O
us O
. O

Easier O
to O
clean O
as O
well O
- O
remove O
the O
fans O
and O
you O
can O
wash O
( O
or O
paint O
) O

I O
got O
this O
for O
my O
virgin O
mobile O
awe O
android O
phone O
. O

Battery O
life O
with O
surfing O
and O
regular O
work O
use O
is O
around O
5 O
and O
1/2 O
hours O
, O
charge O
rate O
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
though O
, O
although O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
's O
just O
because O
the O
battery O
has O
more O
mAh O
than O
my O
previous O
laptop O
. O

I O
like O
that O
its O
very O
sturdy O
and O
its O
not O
this O
cheap O
plastic O
. O

Like O
most O
I O
researched O
this O
to O
death O
, O
I O
read O
every O
review O
, O
and O
was O
worried O
about O
an O
internet O
order O
for O
something O
this O
big O
and O
pricey O
. O

I O
put O
a O
tiny O
32 O
GB O
thumb O
drive O
in O
one O
of O
the O
USB O
ports O

It O
came O
half O
way O
charged O
, O
ready O
to O
be O
installed O
right O
away O
and O
now O
after O
1 O
month O
it O
still O
holds O
an O
average O
charge O
of O
almost O
3 O
hours O
- O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
! O

I O
got O
the O
Samsung O
DVD O
portable O
drive O
Model O
SE O
- O
S084 O
, O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

Feb. O

today O

4th O

to O
be O

However O
, O
the O

not O

as O
I O
thought O

I O
also O
used O
my O

I O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
impressed O
. O

To O
my O
surprise O
- O
the O
keyboard O
was O
virtually O
DEAD O
. O

The O
two O
small O
pockets O
in O
the O
front O
allows O
you O
to O
carry O
other O
stuff O
such O
as O
charger O
, O

free O
or O
even O
your O

) O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
it O
's O
not O
the O
most O
attractive O
case O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Honestly O
, O
for O
an O
entry O
level O
machine O
and O
at O
nearly O
$ O
300 O
you O
ca O
n't O
expect O
much O
. O

It O
also O
fits O
my O
chargers O
for O
both O
devices O
simultaneously O
. O

The O
only O
difference O
is O
that O
the O
AC O
- O
side O
power O
cord O
( O
between O
the O
& O
# O
34;brick&#34 O

I O
am O
Pleased O
to O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
replacement O

like O
this O
without O
heaving O

all O

I O
am O
using O

Otherwise O
a O
nice O
product O
. O

It O
is O
super O
fast O
& O
super O
quiet O
and O
the O
keyboard O
is O
super O
comfortable O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
to O
comfortable O
with O
the O
keyboard O
at O
first O
, O
but O
after O
a O
week O
I O
was O
. O

Here O
I O
just O
have O
my O
Canon O
60 O
mm O
f2 O
. O

If O
I O
could O
turn O
it O
off O
, O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
5 O

The O
problem O
is O
, O
when O
I O
use O
the O
iPhone O
/ O
iPod O
Touch O
support O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
push O
the O
iPod O
Touch O
down O
far O
enough O
to O
make O
a O
connection O
, O
hence O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

This O
looks O
and O
seems O
exactly O
like O
Windows O
7 O
. O

Performance O
is O
just O
short O
of O
flawless O
-- O
perhaps O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
day O
, O
the O
displays O
will O
blink O
momentarily O
. O

However O
when O
I O
plug O
a O
Thumb O
Drive O
into O
it O
, O
it O
tells O
me O
" O
You O
may O
want O
to O
use O
a O
high O
speed O
2 O
. O
0 O
USB O
Drive O
" O
otherwise O
its O
great O

It O
is O
sturdy O
and O
does O
n't O
move O
around O
, O
nor O
does O
the O
laptop O
( O
even O
when O
it O
is O
off O
center O
and O
not O
using O

" O

) O
. O

If O
you O
had O
any O
worries O
about O
the O
build O
- O
quality O
( O
as O
I O
did O
) O
, O
have O
confidence O
that O
this O
is O
a O
well O

built O
machine O

The O
use O
of O
forward O

it O
has O
an O
open O

, O
leaving O

Pairing O
was O
a O
snap O

with O

love O

With O
ambient O
noise O
you O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
hear O
it O
from O
3 O
' O

I O
would O
imagine O
even O
longer O
if O
its O
being O
used O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
the O
256 O
MB O
version O
and O
it O
's O
great O
. O

only O
it O
's O
significantly O
cheaper O
than O
what O
APC O
charges O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
battery O
issues O
and O
this O
speaker O
has O
lasted O
for O
several O
hours O
on O
a O
single O
charge O
. O

I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
small O
and O
lightweight O
as O
I O
have O
used O
it O
for O
appliances O
on O
trips O
in O
Europe O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
is O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
at O
all.- O
Sound O
and O
video O
was O
in O
perfect O
sync.- O
Broadcasting O
quality O
will O
significantly O
vary O
as O
per O
your O
internet O
connection O
though O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
traveled O
on O
an O
airplane O
with O
it O
so O
not O
sure O
how O
it O
fits O
under O
the O
seat O
. O

Good:-The O
ear O

are O
soft O
and O
comfortable.- O

is O
crisp O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
on O

, O
there O
are O
better O
things O
to O
do O
. O

the O

has O
padding O
on O
the O
front O
and O

not O
on O
the O
bottom O

; O
and2 O
. O

can O
be O
cleaned O
. O

With O
a O
cable O
splitter O
and O
a O
longer O
USB O
extension O
cord O
, O
I O
positioned O
the O
950Q O
with O
enough O
space O
to O
let O
the O
tuner O
's O
heat O
dissipate O
, O
so O
the O
remote O
could O
easily O
see O
it O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
easily O
removable O
when O
I O
want O
to O
use O
it O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

any O
slight O
pressure O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
tablet O
will O
distort O
the O
LCD O

Immediate O
impression O
is O
that O
the O
keyboard O
is O
a O
well O
made O
plastic O
alternative O
to O
Apple O
's O
comparatively O
expensive O
aluminum O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
. O

However O
, O
retrieving O
the O
OS O
through O
Internet O
Recovery O
has O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

In O
fact O
it O
would O
trigger O
the O
thermo O
overload O
stopping O
a O
recharge O
. O

I O
then O
left O
it O
to O
charge O
in O
my O
computer O
for O
overnight O
, O
next O
morning O
when O
I O
unplugged O
the O
power O
, O
the O
battery O
still O
showed O
not O
charged O
and O
lasted O
about O
15 O
minutes O
, O
I O
then O
left O
it O
to O
charge O
for O
24 O
hours O

but O
I O
think O
its O
unlikely O
this O
device O
would O
be O
the O
issue O
. O

Slim O
profile O
does O
n't O
make O
too O
much O
noise O
there O
is O
a O
tight O
fit O
with O
the O
tips O
which O
is O
definitely O
a O
bonus O
. O

I O
simply O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
this O
bag O
has O
n't O
been O
re O
- O
issued O
. O

The O
picture O
is O
very O
clear O
, O
whatever O
source O
you O
select O
. O

This O
was O
a O
risk O
for O
me O
, O
I O
bought O
because O
I O
love O
the O
color O
and O
this O
backpack O
desing O
. O

Color O
: O
I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
purple O
is O
a O
deep O
, O
rich O
, O
royal O
purple O
color O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
removing O
that O
useless O
stuff O
, O
but O

You O
can O
store O
the O
upper O
straps O
in O
( O
yet O
another O
) O
of O
the O
compartments O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
to O
put O
the O
bottom O
one O
. O

We O
opted O
to O
ditch O
cable O
a O
couple O
years O
ago O
and O
just O
purchase O
the O
shows O
we O
watch O
off O
itunes O
and O
anything O
else O
comes O
from O
Netflix O
. O

Called O
Otterbox O
and O
was O
told O
to O
send O
back O
to O
Company O
I O
bought O
from O
, O
had O
to O
pay O
to O
send O
back O
, O
did O
n't O
send O
back O
, O
company O
told O
me O
they O
would O
send O
another O
one O
once O
they O
inspected O
one O
sent O
back O
, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
shipping O
again O
. O

but O
it O
does O
not O
do O
as O
much O
as O
the O
number O
of O
buttons O
would O
make O
you O
think O
. O

Does O
n't O
output O
widescreen O
through O

, O
but O
my O

has O
a O
setting O
to O
stretch O
the O
picture O
. O

After O
looking O
at O
a O
lot O
of O
bags O
, O
I O
settled O
on O
this O
one O
, O
even O
tho O

NJIT O
mandates O
that O
faculty O
, O
students O
, O
and O
staff O
purchase O
and O
use O
both O
the O
Microsoft O
Windows O
family O
of O
operating O
systems O
and O
the O
Intel O
family O
of O
CPUs O
. O

so O
I O
only O
have O
to O
plug O
in O
one O
usb O
cable O
. O

After O
a O
year O
with O
this O
laptop O
it O
started O
to O
really O
heat O
up O
in O
the O
back O
where O
the O
processor O
is O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
computer O
work O
really O
slow O
. O

As O
a O
former O
IT O
professional O
, O
I O
am O
very O
sensitive O
to O
poor O
customer O
service O
and O
in O
my O
mind O
the O
company O
now O
deserves O
five O
stars O
as O
they O
stepped O
up O
and O
took O
ownership O
. O

and O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

+ O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
's O
highly O
over O
priced O
considering O
its O
shortcoming O
( O
to O
be O
discussed).RELIABILITY O
: O

SSD O
drive O
fail O
: O

sometimes O
the O
Rubber O
feet O
on O
the O
front O
is O
not O
enough O
depending O
on O
angle O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
weak O
, O
I O
get O
about O
3 O
. O
5 O
hours O
of O
regular O
typing O
/ O
surfing O
usage O
out O
of O
it O
. O

My O
iPad O
stays O
snug O
inside O
and O
does O
not O
move O
around O
. O

The O
exterior O
has O
a O
soft O
- O
touch O
finish O
, O
which O
is O
pleasant O
in O
the O
hand O
and O
quite O
practical O
as O
it O
is O
grippy O
and O
does O
n't O
show O
smudges O
. O

But O
they O
also O
double O
the O
memory O
provided O
internally O
, O
so O
it O
's O
up O
to O
you O
) O
, O
but O
beyond O
that O
, O
you O
can O
pick O
almost O
any O
brand O
and O
get O
comparable O
results O
. O

I O
had O
a O
fear O
of O
Windows O
8 O
because O
I O
'd O
read O
complaints O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
news O
of O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
support O
for O
the O
much O
- O
loved O
XP O
operating O
system O
hit O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
bother O
me O
too O
much O
though O
, O
I O
was O
ok O
with O
batteries O
for O
the O
price O

It O
is O
NOT O
a O
gaming O
system O
, O
but O
it O
did O
receive O
a O
Vista O
WEI O
of O
3 O
. O
8 O
for O
gaming O
graphics O
, O
and O
I O
tried O
it O
with O
two O
older O
( O
pre-2006 O
) O
games O
and O
it O
ran O
just O
fine O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
just O
open O
the O
flap O
and O
grab O
your O
camera O
, O
you O
have O
to O
maneuver O
around O
to O
get O
it O
out O
. O

I O
have O
to O
go O
to O
settings O
to O
get O
the O
keyboard O
to O
connect O
via O
bluetooth O
when O
I O
turn O
it O
on O
the O
first O
time O
. O

So O
I O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
5 O
years O
and O

Nice O
, O
bright O
, O
vivid O
and O
clear O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
to O
this O
product O
is O
the O
price O
. O

This O
camera O
is O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
home O
theater O
setup O
. O

Had O
to O
work O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
first O
time O
, O
but O
OK O
now O
after O
stretching O
. O

The O
hardware O
is O
very O
good O
for O
the O
price O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
5 O
- O
6 O
hours O
on O
the O
Wind O
. O

Some O
things O
to O
consider O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
extra O
RAM O
mentioned O
above O
is O
an O
external O
optical O
drive O
. O

Easily O
installed O
on O
my O
daughters O
computer O
and O
has O
worked O
without O
complications O
from O
the O
very O
first O
day O
. O

1st O
hummed O
light O
a O
POS O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
2nd O
took O
a O
few O
days O
before O
it O
started O
that O
s O

this O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
for O
hooking O
it O
into O
your O
home O
streo O
, O
car O
stereo O
, O
boombox O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
dividers O
are O
not O
padded O
. O

And O
there O
's O
another O
regular O
nylon O
handle O
behind O
it O
, O
above O
the O
straps O
, O
that O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
serve O
any O
purpose O
other O
than O
to O
get O
in O
the O
way O
. O

There O
's O
not O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
bass O
, O
but O
there O
's O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
typically O
listen O
to O
. O

It O
got O
only O
a O
5 O
. O
2 O
win O
assessment O
( O
the O
stock O
Intel O
graphics O
scored O
a O
6 O
. O
2 O
) O
and O
I O
wanted O
speed O
. O

We O
needed O
it O
to O
give O
more O
movement O
from O
computer O
while O
listening O
to O
pandora O
radio O
during O
work O
. O

Excellent O
product O
that O
delivers O
what O
it O
's O
stated O
purpose O
it O
. O

They O
can O
be O
easily O
downloaded O
off O
the O
Net O

Went O
to O
stash O
the O
power O
supply O
cord O
in O
another O
of O
the O
many O
compartments O
, O
hey O
this O
zipper O
is O
nt O
very O
smooth O
, O
it O
should O
be O
smooth O
for O
a O
60 O
+ O
dollar O
bag O
. O

3-prong O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
blow O
out O
the O
lights O
or O
the O
building O
at O
work O
! O
! O
! O

However O
, O
when O
it O
is O
stuffed O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
gear O
, O
the O
magnetic O
flap O
becomes O
useless O
and O
just O
falls O
away O
. O

My O
verdict O
, O
this O
is O
a O
rather O
impressive O
little O
fella O
( O
well O
not O
THAT O
little O
anyway O
) O
featuring O
on O
the O
positive O
side:- O
Impressive O
display O
. O

The O
case O
is O
attractive O
and O
is O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O
the O
six O
cell O
, O

In O
reading O
other O
reviews O
I O
was O
very O
concerned O
about O
wifi O
performance O
, O
an O
issue O
that O
has O
effected O
the O
new O
MacBook O
Air O
as O
well O
. O

I O
travel O
with O
a O
laptop O
( O
17&#34 O
; O
screen O
) O
two O
digital O
cameras O
, O
several O
alternate O
camera O
lens O
, O
and O
a O
tripod O
that O
all O
fit O
comfortably O
in O
this O
Backpack O
. O

The O
monitor O
does O
not O
have O
VESA O
mounting O
holes O
. O

it O
is O
a O
first O
class O
portable O
computer O
for O
class O
papers O
and O
anything O
else O
. O

For O
the O
price O
and O
the O
protection O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
it O
. O

and O
I O
was O
excited O
to O
find O
NO O
problems O

To O
conserve O
energy O
, O
the O
keyboard O
goes O
to O
sleep O
after O
about O
a O
minute O
of O
inactivity O
, O
and O
it O
takes O
a O
couple O
of O
key O
presses O
to O
reestablish O
connection O
. O

So O
make O
sure O
when O
you O
do O
receive O
your O
Wind O

I O
have O
a O
17 O
" O
Gateway O
Fx O
7801u O
laptop O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
backpack O
to O
fit O
this O
because O
of O
its O
size O
. O

I O
love O
this O
mouse O
. O

It O
is O
actually O
very O
nice O
looking O
, O
& O
very O
well O
- O
made O
. O

I O
have O
been O
pulling O
out O
what O
is O
left O
of O
my O
hair O
trying O
to O
get O
my O
* O
& O
^ O

I O
know O
that O
this O
could O
be O
due O
to O
human O
error O
, O
but O
I O
really O
think O
that O
it O
's O
just O
spotty O
. O

Got O
this O
laptop O
several O
months O
ago O
for O
kids O
to O
use O
for O
homework O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
great O
. O

A O
friend O
had O
a O
dell O
laptop O
and O
her O
dog O
chewed O
her O
cord O
so O
we O
ordered O

I O
rarely O
reboot O
the O
system O
( O
it O
's O
just O
not O
necessary O
unless O
I O
do O
an O
OS O
upgrade O
) O
, O
or O
close O
applications O
and O
all O
is O
well O
. O

Cons O
: O
Short O
( O
2yr O
) O

The O
speakers O
are O
louder O
than O
most O
other O
Chromebooks O
. O

Final O
Thoughts O
: O
If O
you O
are O
not O
getting O
a O
gigabit O
connection O
even O
after O
connecting O
to O
a O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
port O
, O
make O
sure O
your O
network O
cable O
is O
CAT O
5E/6 O
or O
above O
. O

Buy O
a O
portable O
external O
harddrive O
such O
as O
' O
Seagate O
FreeAgent O
Go O
' O
and O
backup O
your O
data O
on O
a O
weekly O
basis O
. O

I O
could O
have O
used O
one O
more O
. O

Another O
feature O
that O
I O
love O
, O
but O
was O
not O
originally O
looking O
for O
, O
is O
the O
other O
" O
sleep O
mode O
" O
- O
while O
plugged O
in O
, O
if O
it O
is O
not O
being O
used O
, O
it O
will O
sleep O
in O
order O
to O
save O
battery O
life O
. O

For O
about O
sixty O
bucks O
or O
more O
-- O
several O
times O
the O
price O
of O
these O
third O
- O
party O
ones O
. O

I O
like O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
speakers O
, O
but O
they O
vibrate O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
by O
far O
AC O
adapter O
for O
Dell O
. O

They O
're O
a O
good O
size O
and O
of O
good O
quality O
. O

I O
put O
fresh O
batteries O
in O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

Have O
n't O
used O
with O
Macs O
yet O
so O
ca O
n't O
comment O
in O
that O
regards O
. O

The O
photo O
online O
makes O
it O
seem O
that O
the O
color O
is O
similar O
to O
" O
fuchsia O
" O
or O
a O
brighter O
dark O
pink O
color O
-- O
in O
reality O
, O
the O
color O
is O
a O
duller O
red O
, O
closer O
probably O
to O
" O
oxblood O
" O
or O
" O
burgundy O
. O

Still O
holding O
a O
charge O
as O
well O
as O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
laptop O
and O
it O
has O
been O
over O
two O
weeks O
. O

* O
* O
* O
TO O
ANYONE O
'S O
CONCERN O
, O
THE O
LAPTOP O
WAS O
BOUGHT O
BY O
MYSELF O
FROM O
LOCAL O
APPLE O
STORE O
, O
I O
TRIED O
TO O
RETURN O
THE O
LAPTOP O
WITHIN O
30 O
DAYS O
WITH O
ORIGINAL O
RECEIPT O

We O
often O
are O
taking O
turns O
with O
it O
in O
our O
house O
, O
so O
we O
'll O
be O
buying O
another O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
next O
generation O
comes O
out O
. O

The O
color O
is O
a O
great O
shade O
of O
royal O
blue O
, O
the O
stitching O
is O
even O
, O
and O
the O
band O
closure O
holds O
very O
well O
. O

Keeps O
my O
plug O
and O
mouse O
away O
from O
the O
laptop O
but O
still O
easy O
to O
get O
to O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
it O
was O
not O
upgradeable O
. O

Just O
what O
was O
needed O
to O
get O
my O
laptop O
working O
again O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
! O

I O
bought O
3 O
of O
these O
{ O
PNY O
Attache O
16 O

. O
0 O

I O
can O
walk O
out O
of O
the O
house O
with O
just O
the O
Wind O
U100 O
and O
not O
panick O
. O

This O
is O
great O
because O
of O
the O
size O
and O
weight O
. O

work O
like O
charm O
. O

No O
need O
to O
rehash O
all O
the O
positive O
things O
that O
have O
been O
said O
about O
this O
TV O
. O

Internal O
Sata O
New O

It O
looked O
sturdy O
. O

It O
of O
course O
depends O
on O
the O
music O
selection O
, O
but O
... O

I O
was O
initially O
a O
bit O
hesitant O
because O
of O
the O
price O
, O
but O
it O
's O
been O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

there O
's O
also O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
which O
you O
probably O
wo O
nt O
use O
much O
, O
since O
this O
is O
a O
stay O
at O
home O
case O
. O

I O
will O
wait O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
update O
my O
experiences O
. O

I O
played O
some O
of O
my O
daughter O
's O
music O
and O
it O
sounded O
flat O
... O

No O
big O
deal O
just O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
. O

No O
problems O
so O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
. O

It O
's O
a O
solid O
& O
very O
good O
battery O
but O
did O
not O
charge O
with O
Dell O
InspironIt O
's O
well O
made O
& O
have O
allot O
of O
charge O
in O
it O
but O
was O
not O
compatible."Not O

- O
I O
'm O
older O
so O
my O
hearing O
is O
not O
what O
is O
once O
was O
- O

Well O
made O
and O
light O
, O
it O
's O
just O
right O
. O

I O
have O
used O
it O
to O
shoot O
high O
definition O
video O
of O
several O
events O
both O
indoors O
and O
outdoors O
, O
and O
it O
has O
performed O
admirably O
. O

I O
use O
my O
rMBP O
. O

You O
check O
the O
updates O
to O
see O
if O
the O
battery O
update O
is O
there O
and O
if O
not O
, O
then O
Apple O
needs O
to O
be O
contacted O
. O

I O
must O
admit O
that O
mine O
was O
not O
on O
sale O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
lug O
the O
unit O
around O
with O
the O
oversized O
battery O
attached O
. O

Fits O
a O
HP O
10 O
. O
1 O
inch O
screen O
NetBook O
perfectly O
. O

The O
contrast O
and O
clarity O
of O
this O
screen O
is O
amazing O
. O

But O
hey O
once O
you O
had O
it O
running O
you O
will O
enjoy O
free O
hd O
tv O
on O
your O
pc O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
Dell O
has O
n't O
figured O
this O
out O
. O

It O
's O
a O
simple O
zipper O
opening O
into O
a O
non O
- O
expandable O
pocket O
on O
the O
front O
. O

An O
adapter O
is O
needed O
as O
well O
. O

A O
rare O
combination O
. O

My O
computer O
is O
a O
dinosaur O
. O

This O
is O
a O
quality O
, O
sturdy O
cable O
that O
even O
looks O
nice O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
portable O
workstation O
for O
graphical O
application O
development O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
give O
enough O
and O
consistent O
feedback O
. O

And O
I O
hate O
picking O
up O
little O
speakers O
and O
moving O
them O
with O
me O
. O

it O
is O
also O
good O
in O
that O
depending O
on O
where O
I O
am O
using O
it O
, O
I O
know O
I O
wo O
nt O
have O
to O
unplug O
other O
devices O
to O
plug O
in O
the O
laptop O

Go O
and O
buy O
the O
other O
one O
for O
99 O
cents O
. O

So O
, O
the O
device O
is O
useless O
for O
me O
. O

No O
driver O
cd O
came O
with O
the O
thing O
and O
that O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
the O
Vaio O
requested O
, O
and O
you O
can O
forget O
online O
research O
for O
it O
. O

Poor O
construction O
. O

It O
's O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
, O
very O
portable O
and O
plenty O
efficient O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

I O
bought O
2 O
replacements O
at O
a O
very O
good O
cost O
on O
Amazon O
and O
now O
it O
works O
great O
again O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
3 O
1/2 O
year O
old O
Vostro O
1700 O
, O
which O
was O
only O
holding O
a O
charge O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O

am O

SO O
, O
I O
bought O
the O
following O
different O
model O
flash O
drive O
from O
HP O
after O
that O
happened O
, O
which O
has O
lasted O
me O
from O
June O
2011 O
to O
current O
, O
and O
is O
still O
going O
strong O
with O
commutes O
, O
vacations O
, O
and O
simple O

Its O
a O

for O

I O

but O
mine O

I O
do O
n't O
feel O
that O
the O
computer O
is O
really O
going O
to O
sleep O
when O
folded O
up O
as O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
. O

I O
travel O
around O
with O
my O
projector O
quite O
a O
bit O
and O
you O
never O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
connection O
you O
're O
going O
to O
need O
. O

Great O
quality O
material O
, O
light O
, O
easy O
to O
carry O
and O
small O
enough O
to O
place O
in O
a O
purse O
, O
bookbag O
or O
briefcase O
. O

it O
's O
quiet O
enough O
and O
i O
can O
place O
the O
fans O
where O
i O
want O
. O

I O
found O
out O
one O
was O
bad O
. O

Did O
n't O
take O
long O
at O
all O
to O
program O
the O
software O
to O
have O
it O
do O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
it O
to O
do O
. O

Well O
constructed O
, O
compact O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
, O
and O
the O
service O
was O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
pretty O
decent O
travel O
speaker O
. O

I O
plugged O
it O
into O
my O
USB O
port O
and O
within O
a O
minute O
the O
driver O
was O
automatically O
installed O

these O
are O

even O
have O

I O
agree O
with O
other O
reviewers O
that O
this O
compartment O
could O
be O
better O
padded O

After O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
and O
many O
cycles O
the O
battery O
continues O
to O
perform O
as O
I O
expected O
. O

Also O
one O
important O
issue O
was O
that O
the O
bag O
should O
NOT O
resemble O
a O
laptop O
bag O
, O
I O
live O
outside O
the O
US O
, O
so O
one O
can O
get O
mugged O
pretty O
easy O
if O
people O
can O
tell O
that O
you O
have O
a O
laptop O
on O
you O
. O

It O
finally O
gave O
up O
after O
3 O
years O

I O
will O
install O
an O
anti O
- O
glare O
screen O
protector O
, O
but O
that O
's O
more O
for O
readability O
in O
varied O
conditions O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
it O
and O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
. O

The O
built O
in O
cable O
management O
is O
functional O
( O
barely O
but O
good O

Next O
there O
are O
two O
small O
outside O
pocket O
one O
on O
each O
side O
of O
bag O
, O
both O
are O
6 O
" O
tall O
and O
3 O
1/2 O
" O
wide O
and O
are O
tapered O
at O
the O
bottom O
and O
do O
expand O
to O
top O
of O
pocket O
up O
by O
the O
Velcro O
flap O
. O

As O
a O
touch O
typist O
I O
am O
comfortable O
with O
both O
but O
, O
on O
a O
blind O
test O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
pick O
HP O
's O
over O
Samsung's.&#725 O
; O
Somewhat O
more O
stylish O
design O
. O

I O
have O
had O
one O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
and O
keep O
it O
in O
my O
backpack O
. O

Look O
elsewhere O
for O
a O
case O
that O
has O
an O
extra O
large O
compartment O
if O
that O
's O
important O
to O
you O

Unlike O
the O

prior O

Seriously O
- O
considering O
the O
price O
was O
only O
$ O
15 O

they O
looked O
like O
they O
might O
help O
see O
the O
key O

of O

a O
lot O
better O
especially O
in O
low O

as O
for O

it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
be O
able O
to O
say O
how O
it O
works O

, O
I O
bought O
three O
of O
them O

and O
i O
always O
thinking O
of O
getting O
one O
for O
myself O
too O

One O
final O
note O
before O
I O
conclude O
my O
review O
... O

You O
have O
to O
remove O
1 O
of O
the O
hard O
drives O
to O
install O
the O
SSD O
. O

: O
The O
switches O
are O
of O
bad O
quality O
and O
wear O
out O
fast O
. O

I O
imagine O
filing O
down O
just O
a O
couple O
millimeters O
of O
the O
plastic O
would O
solve O
this O
problem O
, O
though O
I O
do O
n't O
plan O
to O
do O
so O
( O
I O
'll O
snap O
some O
pictures O
soon).=========================FIT O
: O
Almost O
perfect O
... O
just O
barely O
too O
much O
girth O
in O
the O
back O
which O
prevents O
opening O
the O
screen O
all O
the O
way O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
eh O
? O

If O
the O
cord O
was O
a O
few O
feet O
longer O
, O
I O
may O
have O
used O
the O
mouse O
, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
to O
get O
used O
to O
how O
tiny O
it O
is O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
large O
enough O
to O
hold O
lots O
of O
camera O
equipment O
, O
however O
the O
carry O
handle O
is O
not O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
case O
which O
makes O
it O
lopsided O
. O

While O
it O
was O
nowhere O
near O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
wired O
network O
I O
have O
at O
home O
, O
my O
desktop O
had O
more O
than O
adequate O
upload O

Bought O
two O
sticks O
from O
a O
local O
retailer O
for O
my O
DELL O

Do O
n't O
repeat O
my O
mistake O

No O
need O
to O
pay O
alot O
for O
fancy O
brand O

The O

be O

--- O
I'm O
charging O
my O
Android O
now O
. O

A O
capacitor O
that O
was O
soldered O
on O
the O
board O
had O
been O
bent O
over O
to O
45 O
degrees O
when O
the O
case O
was O
assembled O
and O
it O
's O
legs O
were O
pulled O
clear O
out O
of O
the O
board O
. O

But O
, O
I O
'm O
giving O
this O
one O
a O
try O
and O
realize O
for O
many O
people O
, O
this O
is O
the O
reality O
of O
what O
they O
may O
get O
or O
buy O
. O

It O
loaded O
quickly O
and O
worked O
VERY O
well O
in O
both O
my O
Vista O
desktop O
and O
Windows O
7 O
netbook O
. O

I O
love O
this O
bag O
because O
of O
its O
unobtrusive O
simplicity O
. O

Using O
it O
does O
take O
quite O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
accustomed O
to O
because O
of O
its O
small O
size O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
to O
have O
several O
grooves O
to O
set O
the O
angle O
of O
view O
. O

It O
has O
the O
erratic O
, O
sometimes O
nonfunctioning O
touch O
screen O
you O
might O
have O
read O
about O
. O

Just O
ca O
n't O

the O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
installed O
the O
remote O
disk O
software O
on O
my O
Dell O
, O
just O
to O
see O
if O
I O
could O
watch O
a O
movie O
- O
and O

The O
idea O
here O
is O
to O
have O
the O
most O
portable O
device O
to O
share O
movies O
the O
family O
, O
play O
a O
few O
simple O
games O
on O
the O
go O
or O
on O
break O
, O
and O
do O
work O
when O
the O
time O
comes O
. O

And O
I O
can O
still O
use O
other O
programs O
with O
zero O
lag O
or O
hiccups O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
optical O
drive O
still O
does O
not O
work O
( O
obviously O
) O
and O
I O
noticed O
the O
SD O
card O
reader O
does O
not O
work O
( O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
ever O
did O
, O
just O
tried O
it O
out O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
) O
. O

I O
would O
advise O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
series O
from O
Crucial O
. O

Would O
recommend O
it O
! O

I O
like O
this O
mini O
keyboard O
overall O

I O
bought O
the O
Transformer O
Price O
mostly O
to O
carry O
around O
and O
take O
notes O
, O
so O
this O
keyboard O
was O
definitely O
a O
good O
idea O

the O

The O
padding O
is O
thick O

the O

It O
may O
well O
have O
been O
damaged O

because O
it O

with O

the O

the O
keyboard O
has O
intermittent O
issues O
where O
some O
keys O
do O
nt O
press O

I O
contacted O
HP O
and O
they O
could O
n't O
solve O
my O
issue O
either O

This O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
fit O

works O

-- O
but O
as O
others O
have O
suggested O
, O
there O
's O
a O
gap O
in O

it O
wo O

protect O

After O
your O

in O

close O
up O

screw O
on O

, O
I O
would O
recommend O
. O

However O
, O
when O
i O
first O
tried O
it O
out O
, O
the O
keys O
seemed O
to O
be O
too O
plastic O
, O
as O
if O
you O
really O
had O
to O
push O
in O
order O
to O
make O
the O
buttons O
work O
. O

It O
came O
in O
a O
few O
days O
and O
when O
i O
pulled O
it O
out O
of O
the O
package O
, O
i O
snapped O
it O
on O
within O
30 O
seconds O
. O

What O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
the O
new O
NVIDIA O
graphics O
make O
for O
smoother O
performance O
around O
the O
operating O
system O
and O
seem O
to O
contribute O
to O
1 O
) O
better O
battery O
life O
and O
2 O
) O
a O
cooler O
system O
. O

It O
has O
a O
tilt O
/ O
swivel O
head O
. O

While O
it O
wo O
n't O
" O
blow O
your O
hair O
back O
, O
" O
it O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
well O
and O
inexpensively O
. O

I O
am O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
sound O
quality O
of O
this O
" O
boombox O
" O
. O

DIDN'T O
WORK O
TO O
MY O
EXPECTATIONS O
AND O
NEEDS O
, O

One O
day O
I O
was O
at O
a O
local O
store O
and O
saw O
the O
1000HD O
for O
sale O
. O

Have O
n't O
used O
a O
PCMCIA O
in O
so O
very O
long O
, O

For O
most O
of O
my O
usage O
, O
which O
is O
just O
web O
browsing O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
nice O
laptop O
. O

Hint O
, O
hint O
, O
Anker O
:o) O
) O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
wife O
as O
a O
surprise O

forget O
it O
it O
is O
not O
even O
worth O
its O
value O
as O
a O
paper O
weight O
. O

It O
worked O
perfectly O
well O
and O
still O
working O
after O
40 O
days O
. O

That O
's O
pretty O
much O
it O
. O

0 O
speed O
is O
fine O
, O
but O
note O
that O
some O
devices O
need O
to O
be O
( O
or O
work O
better O
) O
connected O
directly O
to O
the O
computer O
and O
not O
through O
a O
hub O
. O

It O
has O
a O
nice O
feel O
to O
it O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
show O
up O
on O
my O
receiver O
Auxilliary O
input O
. O

I O
wanted O
it O
to O
connect O
to O
a O
Belkin O
Audio O
Streamer O

What O
is O
this O
Zone O
Player O
bundle O
? O

This O
sleeve O
was O
purchased O
because O
I O
now O
hav O
2 O
laptops O
in O
my O
house O
that O
need O
protection O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
cross O
- O
over O
cable O
, O
so O
I O
cut O
off O
one O
connector O
to O
crimp O
on O
the O
new O
one O
to O
discover O
the O
way O
the O
cable O
was O
cobbled O
together O
. O

Speed O
much O
faster O
than O
using O
USB O
. O

However O
, O
Google O
call O
does O
not O
turn O
on O
the O
audio O
when O
making O
phone O
calls O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
husband O
who O
travels O
5 O
out O
of O
7 O
days O
a O
week O
for O
work O
. O

This O
is O
one O
Monster O
product O
I O
think O
is O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

The O
price O
is O
great O
for O
this O
case O
and O
it O
works O
just O
as O
well O
as O

I O
will O
need O
to O
test O
the O
HDMI O
and O
VGA O
plugs O
later O
to O
see O
how O
well O
it O
can O
play O
on O
external O
devices O
. O

Best O
feature O
is O
the O
entire O
tip O
rotates O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
trying O
to O
stream O
stuff O
through O
wireless O
, O
than O
this O
antenna O
is O
excellent O
otherwise O
you O
might O
want O
to O
look O
for O
a O
802 O
. O
11n O
one O
. O

I O
like O
that O
it O
charges O
my O
Ipod O
while O
playing O
. O

I O
got O
this O
for O
my O
brother O
actually O
as O
a O
gift O
. O

Overall O
: O
I O
gave O
this O
5 O
stars O
for O
the O
value O
, O
the O
connection O
, O
the O
sound O
, O
and O
ease O
of O
setup O
. O

The O
touch O
screen O
was O
the O
only O
way O
to O
interact O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

The O
instructions O
are O
horrible O
. O

I O
have O
the O
laptop O
secure O
and O
protected O

Can O
be O
easily O
fixed O
by O
buying O
a O
separate O
mouse O
( O
but O
then O
you O
lose O
portability O
) O

He O
really O
enjoys O
having O
it O
. O

I O
was O
refused O
the O
ability O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
tech O
support O
person O
's O
manager O
, O
was O
spoken O
to O
rudely O
, O
and O
all O
but O
hung O
up O
on O
. O

Avoid O
Acer O
if O
you O
can O
. O

and O
I O
had O
no O
problems O
in O
getting O
it O
replaced O
. O

Started O
off O
looking O
at O
the O
netbooks O

I O
do O
not O
take O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
off O
the O
charger O
very O
often O
and O
this O
battery O
only O
ever O
provided O
up O
to O
2 O
hours O
of O
runtime O
at O
best O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
just O
me O
, O
but O
I O
found O
the O
backpack O
to O
be O
very O
comfortable O
. O

Fit O
and O

Some O
reviews O
have O
complained O
about O
having O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
zippers O
, O
but O
that O
has O
not O
been O
an O
issue O
for O
me4 O
. O

It O
does O
seem O
to O
work O
well O
with O
older O
laptops O
( O
but O
older O
laptops O
already O
have O
s O
- O
video O
output O
) O
. O

I O
found O
out O
AFTER O
I O
had O
ordered O
them O
that O
THEY O
DO O
NOT O
WORK O
PROPERLY O
IF O
RUNNING O

When O
used O
hanging O
down O
the O
speaker O
L+R O
are O
reversed O
. O

Since O
the O
hard O
drive O
basically O
directly O
determines O
a O
computer O
's O
real O
- O
world O
performance O
, O
this O
thing O
really O
, O
really O
flies O
. O

I O
'm O
hard O
on O
my O
computers O
, O
I O
expect O
a O
lot O
, O
I O
use O
a O
lot O
of O
graphics O
programs O
, O
I O
expect O
to O
not O
be O
bogged O
down O
by O
my O
laptop O
and O
in O
this O
case O
it O
's O
usually O
my O
internet O
that O
ca O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
me O
. O

With O
this O
laptop O
I O
can O
crank O
the O
graphics O
and O
details O
to O
maximum O
without O
game O
play O
and O
speed O
suffering O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
slightly O
smaller O
than O
a O
normal O
keyboard O
, O
but O
nowhere O
near O
as O
small O
as O
the O
Asus O
Eee O
keyboard O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
I O
have O
dented O
, O
scratched O
, O
or O
somehow O
damaged O
various O
laptop O
/ O
notebook O
computers O
I O
have O
owned O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
this O
usb O
laptop O
clip O
for O
a O
bargain O
so O
for O
the O
money O
I O
took O
a O
chance O
. O

Its O
typically O
a O
user O
error O
or O

But O
the O
phone O
or O
speaker O
needs O
another O
power O
cord O
, O
as O
it O
ran O
out O
of O
battery O
too O
soon O
. O

I O
even O
took O
a O
pass O
on O
Apple O
's O
current O
iPod O
incentive O
( O
I O
still O
buy O
CDs O
, O
mostly O
from O
Amazon).Even O
as O
I O
type O
this O
review O
, O
I O
'm O
conscious O
that O
the O
keyboard O
has O
a O
tighter O
feel O
and O
is O
quieter O
than O
the O
previous O
model O
. O

My O
only O
reason O
for O
giving O
it O
4 O
stars O
is O
that O
it O
has O
too O
many O
openings O
. O

It O
's O
basically O
furniture O
. O

Perfect O
for O
those O
unexpected O
shots O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
miss O
! O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
a O
little O
lower O
compared O
to O
my O
other O
one O
that O
broke O
but O
still O
very O
good O
, O
and O
for O
20 O
bucks O
, O
it O
is O
half O
of O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
that O
broken O
speaker O
! O

My O
office O
is O
10x10 O
in O
a O
new O
construction O
home O
that O
is O
VERY O
well O
insulated O
, O
and O
my O
laptop O
was O
heating O
my O
entire O
office O
by O
up O
to O
a O
few O
degrees O
. O

Got O
to O
say O
, O
I O
love O
this O
case O
... O

Eventually O
found O
that O
it O
uses O
the O
Nokia O
BL O
4C O
cell O
phone O
batteries O
, O
which O
are O
cheap O
, O
so O
I O
bought O
a O
few O
, O
replaced O
the O
bad O
one O

Well O
, O
on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
our O
adventure O
in O
South O
Africa O
, O
my O
entire O
camera O
outfit O
was O
stolen O
including O
the O
PoGo O
, O
all O
the O
media O
and O
a O
special O
9 O
volt O
charger O
I O
had O
made O
to O
power O
it O
in O
the O
bush O
. O

That O
's O
basically O
the O
experience O
you O
get O
on O
the O
chromebook O
. O

Also O
, O
strap O
around O
the O
shoulder O
. O

That O
means O
that O
encrypting O
the O
hard O
drive O
with O
BitLocker O
requires O
additional O
steps O
. O

The O
signal O
strength O
was O
somewhat O
lower O
than O
the O
Intel O
card O
( O
with O
its O
three O
antennae O
in O
the O
netbook O
lid O
) O
, O
which O
was O
understandable O
. O

but O
there O
IS O
a O
Web O
site O
which O
points O
to O
a O
directory O
tree O
whose O
branches O
are O
either O
locked O
up O
or O
empty O
. O

This O
is O
expected O
though O
and O
surely O
not O
any O
reason O
to O
deduct O
points O
. O

I O
want O
to O
you O
guys O
to O
know O
that O
it O
works O
well O
on O
PC O
and O
Mac O
OS O
( O
it O
's O
good O
for O
computer O
users O
who O
like O
compact O
keyboard).In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
's O
awesome O
! O
! O
! O

So O
I O
went O
into O
Amazon O
looking O
for O
Lap O
Tops O
. O

and O
you O
will O
still O
require O
Applecare O
. O

And O
it O
is O
really O
worth O
all O
the O
aggravation O
and O
time O
in O
trying O
to O
get O
your O
problem O
resolved O
. O

RAM O
goes O
bad O
. O

Electronics O
such O
as O
cell O
phone O
's O
, O
laptop O
's O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
are O
designed O
to O
function O
internationally O
. O

and O
I O
'd O
casually O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
monitor O
anyway O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
explore O
LED O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
laptops O
for O
Linux O
. O

Thanks O
again O
Amazon O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
first O
unit O
for O
about O
a O
month O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

Walking O
to O
buses O
or O
cars O
and O
so O
forth O
is O
fine O
, O
though O
. O

There O
is O
not O
much O
to O
say O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
very O
well O
made O
and O
appears O
that O
it O
will O
outlast O
any O
electronic O
item O
I O
put O
in O
it O
. O

Comprised O
of O
two O
small O
( O
1 O
. O
5 O
" O
) O
speakers O
( O
3W O
x O
2 O
) O
and O
a O
4 O
inch O
or O
so O
passive O
radiator O
on O
top O
. O

And O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
case O
is O
coming O
off O
all O
the O
time O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
clip O
perfectly O
. O

I O
would O
prefer O
the O
strap O
to O
have O
a O
buckle O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
Kata O
was O
afraid O
of O
it O
coming O
off O
while O
you O
're O
using O
the O
tripod O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
re O
- O
buckle O
it O
. O

com O
for O
the O
great O
savings O
. O

I O
can O
fit O
a O
hardcover O
book O
, O
but O
the O
main O
compartment O
sticks O
out O
enough O
to O
put O
some O
strain O
on O
the O
zipper O
. O

benn O
using O
it O
for O
many O
months O
with O
no O
prblems O
- O
as O
i O
expect O
. O

Price O
should O
n't O
normally O
factor O
into O
a O
review O
- O
either O
something O
is O
good O
or O
not O

was O
unusual O
and O
very O
helpful O
. O

LG O
is O
n't O
doing O
a O
great O
job O
of O
supporting O
this O
drive O
, O
because O
they O
do O
not O
provide O
any O
of O
this O
software O
online O
for O
download O
, O
not O
even O
the O
manual O
. O

These O
work O
great O
for O
me O
at O
work O
, O
now O
I O
can O
hear O
. O

Although O
I O
like O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
textured O
finish O
on O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
leaves O
way O
too O
many O
fingerprints O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
well O
constructed O
and O
contains O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
pockets O
, O
nooks O
and O
crannies O
to O
carry O
lots O
of O
gear O
. O

This O
is O
much O
nicer O
than O
previous O
laptops O
we O
've O
owned O
where O
the O
cable O
port O
was O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
computer O
and O
the O
cable O
was O
straight O
. O

What O
else O
could O
you O
ask O
of O
it O
? O

The O
backup O
to O
the O
key O
went O
fast O
. O

Good O
product O
, O
works O
well O
and O
uses O
a O
regular O
AA O
battery O
unlike O
most O
mice O
that O
require O
AAA O
. O

So O
here O
's O
how O
to O
program O
the O
Transdock O
-Plug O
in O
the O
Transdock O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
connect O
the O
Sansa O
yet O
. O

Who O
knows O
maybe O
my O
monitor O
is O
nt O
good O
enough O
to O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
the O
calibrator O
and O
the O
software O
? O

The O
bag O
is O
advertised O
as O
being O
both O
a O
backpack O
& O
messenger O
bag O

It O
does O
n't O
fit O
to O
well O
in O
to O
the O
port O
on O
my O
nexus O
7 O
tablet O

Not O
too O
bad O
for O
a O
5plus O
year O
old O
piece O
of O
technology O

It O
fit O
well O
in O
the O
MacBook O

I O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
electric O
appliances O
in O
my O
apartment O
and O
this O
surge O
protector O
saves O
the O
day O
. O

As O
an O
IT O
pro O
I O
could O
pick O
this O
thing O
apart O
here O
and O
there O
and O
compare O
it O
to O
my O
laptops O
all O
da O
, O
but O
that O
would O
be O
a O
biased O
and O
unfair O
assessment O
of O
this O
system O
. O

That O
alone O
has O
impressed O
clients O
, O
and O
the O
machine O
paid O
for O
itself O
the O
first O
time O
I O
used O
it O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
really O
feel O
at O
all O
like O
& O
# O
34;leather&#34 O
; O
and O
it O
does O
eventually O
suffer O
from O
some O
wear O
and O
tear O
from O
being O
folded O
back O
. O

Quick O
delivery O
and O
good O
packaging O
. O

At O
this O
moment O
, O
I O
've O
been O
running O
my O
MBA O
5 O
or O
6 O
hours O
since O
the O
last O
charge O
, O
and O
the O
battery O
meter O
still O
shows O
44 O

remaining O
. O

It O
keeps O
it O
cool O
for O
hours O

The O
original O
new O

could O
only O
get O
a O
sporadic O
1 O

bars O
and O
rarely O
connected O
for O
more O
than O
a O
few O

changed O

everything O

I O
got O

I O
did O
not O

you O
can O
be O

the O

Only O
problem O
is O
that O
it O
will O
all O

stop O

I O
will O

, O
I O
own O
an O

a O

It O
is O
very O
quiet O
especially O
on O
low O
and O
even O
on O
high O
it O
is O
not O
too O
noticeable O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
a O
removable O
briefcase O
for O
a O
15 O

that O
slides O
over O
the O
extended O

a O
really O
great O

had O
a O
need O
for O

The O
Targus O

" O
bag O
is O
an O
amazing O
laptop O
case O
with O
many O
pockets O
and O
zippers O
for O
storage O
and O
organization O
. O

Hope O
this O
is O
helpful O
. O

These O
seem O
to O
be O
particularly O
common O
with O
macbooks O
, O
so O
I O
wanted O
to O
keep O
mine O
clean O
... O

I O
use O
this O
with O
a O
Galaxy O
Note O
tablet O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
data O
were O
backed O
up O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
quite O
nice O
, O
and O
as O
good O
as O
you O
can O
expect O
from O
small O
speakers O
in O
a O
small O
housing O
. O

and O
it O
recognizes O
my O
voice O
great O
and O
clear O
after O
setting O
up O
Realtek O
. O

This O
renders O
the O
antenna O
useless O
! O
! O
! O

Then O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
stuff O
my O
cables O
into O
the O
back O
pocket O
, O
the O
thread O
holding O
the O
back O
pocket O
together O
just O
unravelled O
completely O
. O

I O
have O
a O
160 O
GB O
older O
one O
and O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

These O
speakers O
were O
the O
perfect O
accessory O
for O
my O
new O
large O
flat O
screen O
TV O
in O
my O
library O
. O

It O
's O

I O
now O
love O
my O

even O
more O
! O

Nicely O
done O
. O

There O
's O
really O
not O
much O
more O
to O
say O
about O
it O
. O

The O
MacBook O
does O
not O
complain O
about O
an O
inadequate O
power O

or O
an O
incompatible O

generic O
adaptor O
and O
everything O
works O
great O
. O

and O
I O
was O
up O
and O
running O
at O

The O

connection O
is O
great O
and O
I O
've O
never O
had O
an O
issue O
with O

. O

Perfect O
for O

admins O
. O

was O
excited O
to O
get O
this O
bag O
and O
some O
how O
it O
was O
just O
OK O
. O

I O
've O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
these O
cables O
. O

Sure O
, O
I O
used O
computers O
every O
day O
-- O
I O
work O
on O
them O
, O
play O
on O
them O
-- O
but O
what O
happens O
inside O
a O
computer O
is O
a O
mystery O
to O
me O
. O

( O
I O
say O
two O
as O
you O
do O
n't O
really O
see O
the O
zipper O
for O
the O
smallest O
area O
in O
the O
very O
front O
of O
it).There O
is O
also O
a O
mesh O
back O
to O
this O
, O
which O
helps O
vent O
air O
plus O
it O
adds O
a O
nice O
cushion O
for O
your O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
not O
" O
Wenger O
Synergy O
" O
quality O
with O
super O
thick O
pads O
, O
high O
quality O
build O
material O
and O
durability O
... O
but O
it O
also O
is O
not O
the O
usual O
$ O
50 O
+ O
high O
cost O
bag O
. O

There O
is O
a O
cable O
in O
between O
the O
two O
speakers O
that O
retracts O
and O
extends O
on O
a O
springing O
system O
. O

The O
green O
light O
turns O
on O
to O
tell O
you O
it O
is O
connected O
. O

The O
Ayl O
sounds O
decent O
at O
low O
volume O
, O
there O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
bass O
. O

but O
that O
's O
not O
an O
option O
I O
guess O

Otherwise O
, O
it O
is O
very O
quiet O
. O

If O
you O
think O
you O
are O
going O
to O
use O
this O
( O
or O
the O
iPad O
) O
as O
a O
document O
/ O
media O
creation O
device O
, O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed O
. O

I O
got O
this O
to O
use O
in O
a O
HP O
Pavilion O
DV4000 O
that O
I O
installed O
Ubuntu O
Linux O
14 O
. O
04 O
on O
. O

i O
'd O
like O
them O
to O
go O
off O
after O
15 O
minutes O
or O
so O
. O

UPDATE O
# O
2 O
: O
I O
sent O
three O
e O
- O
mails O
requesting O
a O
refund O
, O
and O
each O
time O
tosell888 O
responds O
with O
instructions O
for O
downloading O
and O
extracting O
the O
zip O
file O
! O

This O
solved O
my O
weak O
signal O
issue O
and O
now O
this O
little O
bad O
boy O
is O
giving O
me O
70 O
+ O
Mbps O
, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
good O
option O
for O
a O
Christmas O
gift O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
a O
big O
screen O
, O
yet O
is O
light O
enough O
to O
compete O
with O
the O
light O
weights O
. O

For O
podcasts O
and O
your O
average O
movie O
, O
the O
sound O
seems O
very O
good O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
insert O
it O
was O
to O
tilt O
the O
computer O
onto O
its O
side O
. O

Ogio O
Renegade O
and O
Thule O
are O
very O
behind O
in O
this O
department O
. O

With O
wireless O
I O
was O
getting O
VERY O
slow O
response O
in O
the O
Media O
Center O
menu O
but O
it O
operates O
much O
more O
smoothly O
with O
the O
Powerline O
adapter O
connected O
. O

Or O
you O
can O
completely O
remove O
the O
mSATA O
SSD O
and O
just O
have O
a O
single O
drive O
notebook O
. O

As O
of O
this O
date O
( O
Oct. O
12 O
, O
2010 O
) O
the O
HP O
website O
has O
newer O
drivers O
for O
almost O
everything O
on O
the O
Envy O
. O

The O
keyboard O
also O
helps O
with O
editing O
and O
typing O
using O
Polaris O
Office O
that O
comes O
pre O
- O
installed O
on O
the O
tabalet O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
flexible O
is O
a O
big O
deal O
IMO O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
. O

Plus O
there O
are O
numerous O
color O
schemes O
so O
it O
should O
please O
everyone O
. O

is O
less O
time O
than O
most O
companies O
would O
have O
filled O
the O
order O
. O

Will O
report O
back O
if O
that O
changes O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
protector O
for O
my O
IMAC O
and O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
its O
classy O
look O
and O
ability O
to O
keep O
my O
screen O
free O
from O
dust O
when O
it O
is O
not O
in O

I O

of O
these O

and O
some O
of O
them O
still O
work O
great O
, O
some O
of O
them O
no O
longer O
stay O
plugged O
into O
my O
phone O
. O

Extraordinarily O
fast O
sleep O
and O
wake O
- O
up O
... O

This O
would O
have O
been O
far O
more O
cost O
effective O
. O

The O
case O
looks O
nice O
and O
provides O
protection O
for O
the O
tablet O
's O
screen O
. O

IT O
IS O
AN O
EXCELLENT O
SOLUTION O
FOR O
BROKEN O

The O
tripod O
also O
has O
a O
compass O
on O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
extend O
your O
laptop O
or O
surface O
tablet O
. O

The O
antenna O
itself O
is O
pretty O
much O
useless O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
if O
the O
Microsoft O
XP O
instructions O
will O
work O
for O
Vista O
or O
7 O
. O

I O
give O
it O
4 O
stars O
because O
they O
shipped O
it O
USPS O
, O
and O
the O
keyboard O
has O
been O
permanently O
bent O
so O
that O
the O
number O
pad O
protrudes O
out O
. O

The O
viewing O
case O
has O
an O
awesome O
design O
, O
and O
keeps O
the O
dvd O
player O
very O
secure O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
making O
it O
easy O
for O
my O
son O
to O
change O
discs O
. O

The O
design O
is O
very O
smart O
, O
it O
is O
magnetic O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
flop O
out O
randomly O
, O
but O
it O
is O
only O
about O
two O
inches O
wide O
, O
I O
just O
wish O
they O
had O
made O
it O
3 O
- O
5 O
inches O
wide O
instead O
as O
it O
would O
not O
have O
taken O
up O
any O
more O
room O
on O
the O
case O
but O
would O
make O
it O
more O
functional.-It O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
keyboard O
in O
regards O
the O
use O
of O
non O
- O
alphabet O
characters O
. O

These O
are O
good O
, O
heavy O
- O
duty O
cords O
that O
stick O
to O
the O
EIC O
standard O
in O
spades O
. O

made O
my O
cell O
phone O
sound O
good O
. O

I O
have O
to O
wonder O
why O
Amazon O
is O
even O
selling O
this O
dinosaur O
. O

Thanks O
HDE O
for O
a O
great O

I O
have O
a O
mac O
pro O
13&#34 O
; O

and O
it O
fits O
very O
well O
. O

I O
think O
if O
this O
keyboard O
was O
reliable O
it O
would O
be O
a O
cheaper O
just O
as O
effective O
replacement O
for O
the O
original O
Apple O
keyboard O
, O
though O
the O
OrientEX O
is O
made O
of O
plastic O
vice O
the O
aluminum O
frame O
of O
the O
apple O
keyboard O

. O

The O
next O
morning O
the O
magnetic O
connector O
lit O
up O
with O
a O
bright O
green O
light O
when O
I O
attached O
it O
, O
but O
the O
menu O
indicator O
showed O
that O
the O
battery O
was O
losing O
power O
rather O
than O
charging O
. O

3 O
screen O
laptops O

It O
was O
very O
inexpensive O
and O
it O
arrived O
on O
time O
, O
which O
was O
great O
because O
I O
live O
in O
Hawaii O
. O

The O
microII O
stopped O
outputting O
in O
anything O
but O
stereo O
after O
about O
a O
week O
of O
use O
( O
thanks O
amazon O
for O
the O
return O
! O
) O
. O

I O
own O
two O
myself O
, O
and O
have O
had O
them O
for O
several O
months O
. O

The O
cover O
stay O
on O
and O
is O
a O
cinch O
to O
remove O
, O
unlike O
some O
reviews O
I O
've O
read O
. O

A O
well O
made O
cable O
, O
the O
sturdiness O
reflected O
in O
the O
slightly O
larger O
diameter O
of O
the O
cable O
, O
and O
the O
fitting O
on O
the O
micro O
end O
( O
a O
weak O
point O
on O
many O
cables O
) O
might O
be O
a O
bit O
large O
for O
some O
protective O
phone O
cases O
( O
fits O
my O
Otter O
Box O
Commuter O
fine O
) O
. O

So O
far O
, O
none O
have O
failed O
in O
8 O
months O
. O

No O
need O
to O
get O
mad O
, O
You O
do O
have O
to O
agree O
1700-Up O
Price O
range O
is O
expensive O
but O
if O
you O
have O
the O
money O
and O
are O
planning O
to O
take O
care O
of O
it O
go O
ahead O
and O
buy O
it O
. O

One O
other O
big O
plus O
, O
and O
one O
I O
compared O
to O
the O
Best O
Buy O
demos O
, O
is O
the O
keyboard O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
market O
decided O
high O
resolutions O
were O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
tag O
. O

Well O
there O
's O
not O
much O
to O
say O
, O
its O
a O
6 O
foot O
usb O
cable O
. O

I O
even O
installed O
the O
touchscreen O
mod O
on O
it O
, O
which O
was O
good O
fun O
, O
and O
quickly O
exposed O
me O
to O
the O
internals O
of O
netbooks O
. O

No O
vent O
issues O
. O

( O
Better O
then O
the O
one O
it O
came O
with O
! O
) O

I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
long O
it O
will O
last O
, O
but O
at O
this O
price O
I O
can O
afford O
to O
buy O
one O
a O
year O
. O

This O
dual O
layer O
burner O
is O
fast O
and O
super O
compact O
! O

What O
they O
do O
n't O
realize O
is O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
really O
upside O
down O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
be O
buying O
2 O
- O
3 O
more O
of O
these O
for O
additional O
led O
strip O
lighting O
projects O
. O

It O
delivers O
as O
well O
as O
most O
other O
Android O
Tablets O
at O
a O
good O
price O
. O

After O
about O
a O
few O
days O
of O
use O
, O
you O
get O
it O
customized O
to O
your O
liking O
. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
Napolian O
pocket O
as O
it O
makes O
getting O
to O
my O
pack O
of O
tissues O
and O
my O
wallet O
so O
easy O
. O

I O
was O
tired O
of O
using O
the O
Windows O
interface O
, O
and O
wanted O
an O
operating O
system O
that O
is O
easy O
and O
that O
logically O
made O
sense O
. O

I O
've O
been O
having O
this O
bag O
since O
2011 O
, O
before O
my O
freshman O
year O
of O
college O
. O

Also O
I O
would O
say O
95 O
% O
of O
the O
places O
I O
hang O
out O
( O
home O
, O
caf&eacute;s O
, O
friend O
's O
places O
, O
even O
my O
church O
) O
have O
high O
- O
speed O
wi O
- O
fi O
. O

After O
an O
afternoon O
of O
setup O
attempts O
( O
PC O
+ O
peripherals O
) O
, O
the O
machine O
crashed O
to O
a O
" O
black O
screen O

Without O

slips O
into O
& O
lt;&lt O
; O
the O
top O
section O
with O
enough O
room O
lengthwise O
and O
width O
. O

Great O
way O
to O
keep O
the O
laptop O
hard O
drive O
and O
have O
easy O
axsess O
to O
the O
data O
or O
easy O
transfer O
data O
to O
other O
drives O
. O

This O
cooler O
fan O
looks O
good O
and O
seems O
to O
work O
OK O
. O

I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
stuff O
almost O
everything O
I O
would O
have O
normally O
put O
into O
the O
overnighter O
into O
this O
bag O
. O

Eventually O
I O
decided O
to O
buy O
a O
Netbook O
. O

Although O
I O
got O
my O
bag O
at O
a O
crazy O
discount O
, O
I O
think O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
high O
quality O
bag O
that O
does O
n't O
scream O
" O
expensive O
cameras O
inside O
" O
should O
check O
this O
bag O
out O
. O

sound O
, O
as O
she O
calls O
it O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

Ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
one O
, O
it O
's O
a O
winner O
. O

I O
called O
Sony O
ready O
to O
buy O
an O
original O
battery O
and O
they O
mentioned O
several O
item O
numbers O
that O
I O
was O
not O
aware O
of O
. O

Not O
many O
pre O
- O
installed O
crapware O
( O
new O
laptops O
do O
n't O
come O
with O
those O
annoying O
crapware O
that O
reminds O
you O
to O
" O
Try O
for O
30 O
days O
" O
every O
5 O
seconds O
... O
had O
enough O
main O
programs O
and O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted)- O
Keyboard O
and O
track O
pad O
clicking O
are O
AWESOME O
( O
big O
typing O
keys O

I O
should O
n't O
be O
seeing O
that O
-- O
especially O
not O
with O
an O
audio O
file O
that O
's O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
long O
. O

I O
found O
the O
video O
editor O
WILL O
NOT O
work O
right O
if O
you O
have O
HAALI O
codecs O
installed O
, O
usually O
comes O
with O
ffdshow O
. O

I O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
buy O
a O
removable O
dvd O
drive O

I O
lost O
one O
after O
about O
7 O
months O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
that O
was O
due O
to O
the O
power O
outages O
I O
was O
having O
when O
my O
UPS O
could O
not O
hold O
the O
load O
. O

I O
know O
there O
are O
some O
positive O
reviews O
about O
this O
thing O
... O
but O
have O
you O
ever O
seen O
so O
many O
negative O
ones O
? O

No O
more O
frustration O
but O
fruition O
of O
what O
i O
had O
hoped O
for O
! O

It O
was O
exactly O
as O
advertised O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
charge O
it O
very O
quickly O
with O
the O
EOM O
charger O
that O
came O
with O
my O
computer O
. O

The O
only O
way O
around O
that O
is O
to O
have O
to O
remember O
to O
hit O
a O
key O
before O
you O
start O
seriously O
start O
typing O
anything O
, O
then O
give O
it O
a O
few O
seconds O
. O

Update O
12/17 O
: O
Still O
sucks O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
it O
gets O
VERY O
jumpy O
overtime O
when O
I O
used O
it O
with O
my O
macbook O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
same O
exact O
battery O
in O
my O
laptop O
for O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
years O
and O
it O
has O
been O
able O
to O
within O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
charging O
and O
uncharging O
and O
sleep O
mode O
, O
etc O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
I O
may O
start O
over O
with O
something O
more O
friendly O
like O
an O
HP O
Elitebook O
. O

Since O
integrated O
audio O
has O
improved O
, O
it O
's O
been O
several O
years O
since O
I O
've O
owned O
a O
SoundBlaster O
product O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
think O
an O
adapter O
was O
a O
hard O
thing O
to O
get O
right O
, O
but O
apparently O
HDE O
has O
more O
difficulty O
in O
that O
department O
than O
would O
be O
expected O
. O

It O
performs O
more O
adapter O
functions O
then O
any O
other O
device O
. O

It O
says O
it O
fits O
15 O
in O
laptops O
so O
my O
13 O
in O
fit O
perfectly O
with O
plenty O
of O
more O
space O
! O

One O
of O
my O
several O
girlfriends O
wanted O
me O
to O
research O
a O
good O
notebook O
computer O
for O
her O
to O
buy O
. O

even O
with O
my O
processor O
being O
2 O
. O

This O
touch O
screen O
works O
well O
, O
and O
that O
is O
an O
advantage O
over O
any O
Apple O
computer O
product O
( O
excluding O
tablets O
and O
cell O
phone O
. O
) O

I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
the O
cords O
, O
the O
fan O
or O
any O
other O
component O
. O

And O
the O
outside O
pocket O
is O
big O
enough O
to O
carry O
the O
charger O
and O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
my O
next O
stay O
at O
a O
hotel O
with O
free O
wi O
- O
fi O

USB O
, O
is O
not O
only O
much O
, O
MUCH O
slower O
, O
but O
less O
reliable O
. O

love O
the O
slick O
& O
light O
design O
. O

Perhaps O
better O
packaging O
would O
eliminate O
this O
as O
a O
problem O
source O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
better O
without O
the O
lights O
being O
turned O
on O
. O

Then O
I O
would O
have O
to O
log O
off O
the O
wifi O
and O
log O
back O
on O
for O
the O
next O
5 O
- O
10 O
minutes O
. O

Swipe O
up O
on O
the O
top O
right O
square O
and O
it O
will O
" O
maximize O
" O
your O
browser O
page O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
really O
seem O
up O
to O
the O
task O
of O
toting O
around O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
laptop O
. O

The O
DC O
jack O
on O
my O
ASUS O
Laptop O
failed O
3 O
times O
within O
a O
year O
. O

it O
really O
aggravated O
me O
that O
after O
a O
little O
over O
4 O
years O
and O
$ O
100s O
spent O
even O
though O
the O
iPad O
was O
perfectly O
fine O
90 O
% O
of O
my O
applications O
I O
relied O
on O
daily O

I O
would O
buy O
an O
original O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
hate O
to O
fork O
out O
$ O
120 O
for O
a O
friggin O
battery O
, O
it O
's O
night O
and O
day O
. O

but O
you O
're O
getting O
a O
high O
quality O
bag O
that O
should O
feasibly O
last O
for O
years O

For O
me O
, O
both O
of O
those O
cards O
brought O
more O
problems O
than O
they O
solved O
. O

I O
did O
see O
the O
negative O
reviews O
but O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
just O
a O
few O
bad O
apples O
and O
that O
my O
product O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
still O
love O
this O
feature O
call O
me O
old O
school O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
monitor O
. O

The O
cable O
tv O
looked O
about O
the O
same O
, O
but O
I O
had O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
, O
lots O
of O
overscan O
. O

Great O
value O
. O

I O
am O
coming O
from O
a O
07 O
macbook O
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
get O
adapt O
to O
the O
W8 O
, O
but O
so O
far O
everything O
is O
running O
smooth O
. O

My O
tablet O
was O
refurbished O
and O
within O
3 O
days O
I O
had O
to O
return O
it O
since O
I O
guess O
the O
actually O
problem O
it O
had O
before O
being O
refurbished O
was O
n't O
found O
out O
and O
corrected O
, O
so O
maybe O
refurbished O
is O
a O
misnomer O
. O

damage O
was O
only O
once O
and O
was O
the O
strip O
of O
the O
screen O

Hence O
the O
search O
for O
external O
but O
portable O
speakers O
. O

This O
is O
great O
for O
when O
I O
actually O
use O
the O
on O
- O
board O
keyboard O
, O
since O
I O
am O
otherwise O
constantly O
scrolling O
all O
over O
the O
place O
with O
the O
palms O
of O
my O
hands O
as O
I O
try O
to O
do O
some O
typing O
. O

However O
, O
sometime O
I O
had O
to O
reboot O
to O
get O
my O
network O
mounts O
back O
. O

Outside O
of O
this O
section O
are O
other O
pockets O
and O
sections O
built O
into O
the O
bag O
itself O
. O

Windows O
8 O
is O
a O
resource O
hog O
and O
the O
interface O
is O
terrible O
. O

The O
case O
really O
sets O
my O
mind O
at O
ease O
when O
I O
lug O
it O
in O
my O
duffle O
bag O
, O
carry O
- O
on O
, O
or O
back O
pack O
. O

If O
they O
had O
a O
16 O
G O
cache O
option O
, O
it O
might O
have O
worked O
for O
me O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
very O
happy O
customer O
. O

If O
most O
of O
what O

media O
( O
music O
, O
photos O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
are O
in O
the O
cloud O
... O

It O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

he O
no O
longer O
has O
an O
excuse O
. O

I O
thought O
for O
$ O
25 O
, O
why O
scrub O
this O
when O
I O
can O
get O
a O
new O
one O
in O
a O
color O
I O
prefer O
. O

I O
bougth O
this O
HP O
for O
my O
little O
nice O
, O
we O
love O
it O
it O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory O
, O
webcam O
etc O
, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
she O
love O
it O
, O
i O
hope O
you O
enjoy O
because O
is O
ship O
and O
simple O
to O
use O
, O
over O
all O
is O
a O
HP O
and O
HP O

I O
tend O
to O
prefer O
it O
with O
books O
myself O
. O

But O
it O
looks O
like O
I O
miss O
read O
it O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
really O
want O
them O
for O
short O
- O
term O
name O
tags O
, O
they O
're O
great O
. O

overall O
: O
i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
for O
anyone O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
laptop O
to O
surf O
the O
web O
and O
nothing O
else O
. O

It O
took O
me O
a O
few O
days O
to O
start O
using O
this O
stylus O
, O
since O
I O
was O
so O
used O
to O
using O
the O
touchscreen O
( O
with O
my O
finger O
) O
. O

it O
's O
super O
convenient O
for O
quick O
drinking O
while O
walking O
around O
campus O
. O

Even O
when O
running O
from O
battery O
I O
only O
needed O
to O
use O
one O
half O
of O
the O
split O
- O
ended O
USB O
cable O
. O

It O
matches O
the O
Mini O
's O
design O
nicely O
. O

I O
will O
always O
report O
back O
and O
amend O
to O
my O
reviews O
if O
problems O
arise O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
they O
shut O
down O
before O
they O
actually O
melt O
. O

right O
next O
to O
the O
power O
button O
can O
not O
" O
reach O
" O
the O
edge O
of O
my O
Pro O
Aluminum O
chassis O
, O
and O
another O
one O
barely O
made O
it O
after O
I O
pressing O
it O
very O
hard O
onto O
my O
Pro O
Unibody O
. O

The O
nylon O
material O
quality O
is O
great O
, O
zippers O
are O
smooth O
and O
feel O
very O
durable O
. O

I O
upgraded O
to O
2Gb O
of O
memory O
, O
but O
could O
only O
find O
1 O
. O

During O
zooming O
, O
it O
took O
a O
little O
time O
to O
focus O
when O
I O
zoomed O
-- O
a O
second O
longer O
than O
I O
'd O
like O
-- O
but O
from O
what O
I O
've O
seen O
with O
my O
friends O
' O
lesser O
quality O
Panasonics O
and O
Sanyos O
, O
this O
focuses O
ten O
times O
quicker O
than O
theirs O
. O

This O
does O
not O
lower O
my O
review O
score O
because O
I O
never O
intended O
to O
use O
the O
GPS O
on O
a O
Wifi O
only O
device O
. O

Lots O
of O
compartments O
and O
well O
made O
. O

so O
2x2 O
= O
4 O
GB O
total O
) O
. O

Also O
fan O
sound O
is O
high O
enough O
to O
overhear O
the O
video O
sounnd O
. O

Check O
out O
my O
other O
images O
of O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
might O
be O
helpful O
! O

A O
great O
lightweight O
way O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
do O
nt O
short O
your O
batteries O
. O

but O
I O
was O
totlally O
wrong O
. O

Finally O
, O
you O
also O
have O
the O
last O
refurb O
you O
sent O
me O
back O
in O
your O
possession O
. O

this O
is O
just O
the O
right O
size O
especially O
with O
the O
extra O
pocket O
for O
the O
cord O
etc O
. O

Will O
update O
after O
more O
use O
, O
but O
worked O
perfectly O
so O
far O
. O

Why O
should O
you O
have O
to O
program O
the O
box O
? O

VERY O
HOT O
WHEN O
LEFT O
PLUGGED O
IN O
AND O
USING O
FOR O
ANY O
LENGTH O
OF O
TIME O
. O

So O
if O
your O
an O
on O
the O
go O
type O
of O
person O
that O
carries O
little O
paper O
and O
books O
, O
this O
is O
the O
bag O
for O
you O
! O

Keyboard O
is O
easy O
to O
get O
used O
too O
after O
a O
short O
while O
. O

I O
stopped O
buying O
the O
genetic O
ones O
because O
it O
will O
cost O
more O
eventually O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

He O
has O
corrected O
the O
failure O
and O
all O
subsequent O
products O
are O
being O
manufactured O
with O
the O
end O
caps O
securely O
fitted O
to O
the O
roller O
. O

and O
chances O
are O
good O

This O
is O
a O
pretty O
specialized O
product O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Likewise O
, O
using O
my O
Shure O
's O
, O
I O
did O
not O
need O
to O
turn O
the O
volume O
to O
the O
max O
in O
order O
to O
enjoy O
the O
music O
. O

I O
sent O
this O
rolling O
case O
to O
my O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
who O
is O
a O
prosecutor O
in O
a O
big O
town O
in O
Germany O
. O

I O
put O
speaker O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
me O
and O
started O
playing O
a O
Dolby O
HD O
Surround O
Sound O
test O
video O
. O

It O
can O
handle O
a O
substantial O
load O
( O
400W O
, O
though O
if O
you O
're O
running O
it O
from O
a O
cigarette O
lighter O
outlet O
it O
will O
cap O
it O
at O
150 O
to O
protect O
your O
vehicle O
) O
and O
is O
virtually O
silent O
at O
the O
smaller O
loads O
( O
& O
lt;50 O
watts O
) O
, O
and O
not O
loud O
even O
at O
full O
force O
. O

They O
were O
very O
cheaply O
made O
and O
that O
is O
why O
I O
choose O
mediabridge O
hoping O
to O
get O
a O
better O
product O
. O

The O
battery O
is O
internal O
, O
so O
you O
'll O
need O
a O
screwdriver O
and O
plastic O
pry O
tool O
when O
the O
time O
for O
a O
new O
battery O
comes O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
charge O
me O
even O
though O
this O
product O
is O
defective O
, O
and O
so O
did O
Verbatim O
- O
( O
whispering O
subliminally O
... O
" O
buy O
the O
Logitech")Logitech O

On O
the O
3-axis O
cube O
, O
only O
1 O
bubble O
at O
a O
time O
is O
useful O
. O

To O
my O
surprise O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
need O
any O
screws O
! O

tried O
it O
to O
split O
the O
output O
on O
my O
xbox O
360 O
and O
it O
did O
nt O
work O
. O

I O
connect O
the O
Chromebook O
with O
the O
HDMI O
, O
I O
connect O
a O
bluetooth O
mouse O
and O
keyboard O
, O
shut O
the O
lid O
on O
the O
Chromebook O
( O
that O
automatically O
puts O
it O
into O
" O
docking O
" O
mode O
, O
so O
it O
runs O
with O
the O
cover O
closed O
. O

And O
if O
you O
think O
calling O
Apple O
support O
will O
help O
, O
think O
again O
. O

The O
front O
and O
side O
pockets O
open O
and O
close O
using O
buttons O
. O

A O
hard O
case O
's O
main O
purpose O
is O
to O
provide O
protection O
and O
this O
one O
does O
that O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
1 O
more O
small O
container O
at O
the O
bottom O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

Expect O
this O
stylus O
to O
work O
on O
other O
that O
the O
Dell O
Duos O
. O

I O
used O
this O
USB O
to O
PS2 O
adapter O
on O
a O
custom O
mobo O
.It O
worked O
perfectly O
after O
I O
enabled O
USB O
support O
. O

The O
Mouse O
looks O
really O
cute O
and O
due O
to O
its O
shape O
perfectly O
fits O
in O
my O
hand O
. O

Turn O
your O
computer O
around O
so O
that O
the O
lower O
end O
is O
resting O
on O
your O
legs O
and O
you O
can O
still O
plug O
in O
the O
fan O
. O

work O
perfectly O
with O
my O
ipad O
2 O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
defect O
I O
can O
tell O
and O
has O
been O
installed O
in O
my O
ipad O
2 O
over O
8 O
month O
. O

Windows O
is O
a O
work O
beast O
, O
and O
Mac O
is O
heavily O
tuned O
for O
casual O
and O
home O
computing O
. O

No O
fault O
of O
the O
computer O
's O
though O
. O

it O
's O
spacious O
and O
the O
wheels O
are O
smooth O
. O

I O
've O
used O
it O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

Fast O
boot O
up O
time O
is O
terrific O
too O
. O

However O
, O
the O
promised O
stylus O
and O
Velcro O
cord O
were O
not O
included O
with O
the O
order O
. O

The O
ability O
to O
throw O
my O
mp3 O
in O
the O
backpack O
and O
listen O
to O
it O
would O
be O
handy O
and O
works O
, O
but O
not O
that O
useful O
when O
I O
spent O
most O
of O
my O
time O
with O
the O
bag O
under O
the O
seat O
or O
not O
on O
my O
back O
. O

However O
, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
product O
is O
perfect O
for O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
causing O
it O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
to O
shut O
your O
laptop O
when O
needing O
too O
. O

When O
its O
plugged O
in O
it O
automatically O
downloads O
and O
installs O
all O
required O
and O
relevant O
software O
and O
drivers O
. O

I O
am O
really O
pleased O
that O
I O
have O
found O
this O
product O
. O

An O
interesting O
note O
- O
6 O
year O
- O
olds O
do O
n't O
even O
notice O
that O
it O
is O
a O
smaller O
keyboard O
. O

I O
am O
no O
longer O
using O
the O
second O
room O
feature O
. O

I O
'm O
impressed O
and O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

The O
case O
arrived O
quickly O
and O
was O
easy O
to O
figure O
out O
. O

IN O
ALL O
OF O
THE O
YEARS O
OF O
BUYING O
FROM O
AMAZON O
, O
THIS O
WAS O
THE O
FIRST O
TIME O
I O
MADE O
A O
RETURN O
. O

Just O
basically O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
cord O
, O
the O
actual O
little O
adapter O
on O
it O
is O
super O
light O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
numerous O
Windows O
8 O
tablets O
( O
Samsung O
ATIV O
500 O
T O
and O
700 O
T O
, O
Acer O
Iconia O

I O
was O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
soft O
- O
sided O
case O
for O
my O
iPad O
2 O
. O

Unlike O
Apple O
and O
Windows O
device O
installs O
, O
I O
saw O
no O
driver O
install O
message O
and O
both O
devices O
were O
usable O
within O
seconds O
of O
plugging O
into O
the O
USB O
socket O
. O

I O
even O
run O
XWindows O
on O
my O
PowerBook O
. O

Their O
AV O
and O
HDMI O
cables O
are O
ridiculously O
overpriced O
and O
inferior O
in O
quality O
to O
much O
less O
expensive O
brands O
like O
Monoprice O
. O

I O
was O
using O
the O
original O
cheapo O
speakers O
that O
came O
with O
the O
5 O
year O
old O
PC O
, O
and O
these O
are O
a O
dream O
to O
listen O
to O
. O

I O
've O
used O
the O
sound O
kick O
with O
iPhones O
, O
iPads O
, O
and O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
easily O
and O
without O
any O
trouble O
. O

I O
did O
try O
picking O
at O
the O
velcro O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
come O
up O
. O

Was O
there O
a O
tsunami O
where O
the O
Headamp O
factory O
is O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
hear O
about O
? O

but O
I O
did O
not O
like O
that O
she O
was O
able O
to O
see O
my O
mail O
etc O
. O

As O
others O
have O
mentioned O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
bait O
and O
switch O
in O
the O
software O
offering O
. O

Easy O
to O
carry O
the O
heavy O
load O
instead O
of O
a O
handheld O
back O
that O
would O
have O
hurts O
the O
shoulders O
. O

Smart O
- O
login O
( O
using O
the O
included O
webcam O
) O
works O
on O
- O
and O
- O
off O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
lighting O
conditions O
( O
d O
- O
uh O
! O
) O

I O
had O
that O
drive O
for O
over O
a O
year O
( O
and O
still O
have O
it O
) O
before O
deciding O
to O
upgrade O
to O
this O
drive O
for O
the O
USB3 O
speeds O
and O
the O
all O
metal O
housing O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
these O
things O
cost O
more O
in O
those O
days O
than O
this O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
it O
is O
now O
a O
perfectly O
fine O
temperature O
, O
hardly O
warm O
to O
the O
touch O
. O

You O
can O
also O
turn O
it O
around O
to O
extend O
the O
bottom O
the O
square O
under O
the O
webcam O
to O
place O
it O
on O
top O
a O
screen O
. O

The O
front O
pocket O
with O
the O
various O
pouches O
/ O
compartments O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Airport O
security O
these O
days O
is O
so O
fun O
to O
go O
through O
... O

Perhaps O
the O
best O
thing O
that O
I O
can O
say O
about O
this O
speaker O
is O
that O
it O
fits O
comfortably O
with O
any O
number O
of O
devices O
. O

Voila O
, O
the O
wireless O
NIC O
instantly O
found O
the O
router O

So O
I O
bough O
the O
Gogroove O
and O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

The O
Mag O
Safe O
Power O
Connector O
is O
another O
amazing O
design O
feature O
on O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O

to O
travel O
and O
stay O
for O
awhile O

It O

could O
not O
have O
been O
easier O
. O

It O
never O
comes O
completely O
off O
, O
but O
the O

hit O
the O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
touchpad O
; O
it O
seems O
sensitive O
, O
but O
often O
wo O
n't O
react O
to O
a O
double O

. O

Yet O
when O
I O
played O
certain O
videos O
on O
it O
( O
some O
of O
the O
videos O
being O
home O
- O
made O
by O
family O
members O
) O
, O
the O
volume O
was O
too O
low O
( O
even O
with O
it O
turned O
all O
the O
way O
up O
) O
to O
be O
easily O
heard O
by O
multiple O
people O
seated O
around O
a O
living O

. O

It O
sounds O
surprisingly O
good O
for O
its O
size O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
on O
the O
hope O
to O
see O
the O
top O

I O
have O
sitting O
here O
, O
to O
find O

they O
are O
shot O
or O
NOT O
, O
and O
the O
top O
drives O
are O
NOT O
recognized O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
'm O
adding O
one O
of O
those O
paper O
- O
thin O
mouse O
pads O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
great O
! O

It O
fits O
right O
into O
the O
section O
that O
I O
think O
was O
meant O
for O
file O
folders O
, O
so O
I O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
I O
travel O
or O
wherever O
I O
go O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

This O
battery O
was O
inexpensive O
and O
works O
beautifully O
. O

Protects O
my O
MacBook O
like O
a O
charm O
and O
it O
looks O
good O
too O
. O

This O
also O
applies O
to O
the O
ethernet O
, O
which O
is O
gigabit O
. O

The O
USB O
cable O
stows O
in O
a O
built O
- O
in O
compartment O
. O

it O
keeps O
my O
cards O
SAFE O
and O
organized O
! O

I O
Think O
It O
Is O
A O
Defect O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
the O
multitouch O
gestures O
. O

In O
other O
words O
hassle O
free O
training O
sessions O
. O

To O
start O
off O
, O
i O
got O
a O
horrible O
luck O
because O
of O
the O
screen O
bleed O
, O
which O
reminds O
me O
again O
never O
buy O
monitors O
unless O
you O
can O
see O
them O
in O
real O
life O
and O
check O
the O
screen O
. O

That O
being O
said O
... O
I O
am O
only O
giving O
this O
3 O
out O
of O
5 O
stars O
because O
the O
product O
is O
cheap O
. O

These O
dongles O
came O
in O
the O
mail O
very O
quickly O
( O
there O
are O
2 O
in O
the O
package O
) O
. O

I O
wasinformed O
that O
I O
could O
return O
the O
hub O
if O
I O
want O

You O
just O
get O
to O
sit O
back O
and O
listen O
to O
music O
hands O
free O
. O

, O
good O
build O
quality7 O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
work O
for O
a O
full O
size O
laptop O
, O
but O
maybe O
if O
you O
got O
two O
. O

They O
are O
horrible O
to O
work O
with O
if O
you O
get O
DOA O
memory O
, O
which O
happened O
to O
me O
on O
2 O
PNY O
sticks O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
I O
am O
encountering O
( O
hence O
the O
3-star O
rating O
) O
is O
50 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
I O
go O
to O
turn O
on O
my O
laptop O
, O
the O
fan O
will O
start O
humming O
very O
loudly O
. O

But O
, O
the O
size O
apart O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
well O
constructed O
little O
bag O
. O

It O
went O
on O
well O
. O

I O
do O
know O
however O
that O
it O
has O
n't O
affected O
me O
in O
the O
least O
, O
the O
unit O
is O
always O
ready O
when O
I O
am O
- O
no O
waiting O
. O

so O
I O
can O
carry O
all O
my O
required O
devices O
with O
me O
when O
I O
go O
out O
to O
work O
on O
a O
customers O
computer O
. O

The O
wires O
can O
be O
somewhat O
inconvenient O
, O
take O
note O
that O
you O
need O
to O
plug O
in O
to O
a O
USB O
and O
Mic O
jack O
. O

but O
it O
's O
asus O
so O
who O
knows O
. O

The O
USB O
outlets O
do O
work O
on O
the O
new O
iPad O
( O
3rd O
generation O
) O
and O
for O
my O
android O
phone O
. O

Yes O
, O
very O
inconvenient O
. O

Shopped O
around O
and O
this O
was O
priced O
best O
, O
arrived O
on O
time O
and O
in O
good O
condition O
, O
has O
been O
as O
reliable O
as O
the O
others O
that O
I O
use O
- O
totally O
reliable O
. O

Returning O
this O
and O
getting O
a O
new O
woofer O
system O
. O

I O
like O
the O
way O
it O
can O
be O
utilized O
on O
various O
items O
through O
the O
bluetooth O
technology O
. O

" O
still O
, O
if O
you O
're O
a O
pc O

, O
i O
'd O
recc'd O

Definitely O
recommended O

3 O
" O
Ultrabook O
for O
several O
months O
but O
could O
n't O
decided O
on O
a O
sleeve O
. O

If O
your O
lifestyle O
is O
like O
mine O
, O
where O
you O
can O
do O
most O
of O
your O
work O
on O
your O
home O
or O
work O
computer O
and O
maybe O
you O
have O
a O
high O
- O
end O
phone O
that O
fills O
in O
another O
big O
part O
of O
your O
technological O
needs O
, O
a O
Chromebook O
may O
be O
a O
good O
solution O
for O
you O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
returning O
the O
Rally O
7 O
and O
kept O
the O
Rally O
5 O
. O

Good O
volume O
control O
and O
bass O
& O
treble O
adjust O
knob O
... O

At O
first O
this O
was O
close O
to O
the O
original O
but O
honestly O
I O
hardly O
ever O
use O
my O
laptop O
on O
battery O

It O
still O
has O
2 O
CPU O
's O
in O
it O
. O

And O
the O
last O
drawback O
of O
this O
product O
is O
that O
like O
all O
things O
Monster O
, O
it O
is O
( O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
comparatively O
speaking O
) O
grossly O
overpriced O
. O

Good O
case O
to O
carry O
and O
store O
all O
my O
SD O
memory O
cards O
for O
my O
NEX-7 O
camera O
. O

It O
's O
programmable O
with O
20 O
FM O
radio O
presets O
. O

It O
's O
kinda O
useless O
for O
me O
. O

To O
me O
, O
that O
constitutes O
a O
product O
defect O
and O
represents O
wholly O
unacceptable O
product O
performance O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
magnetic O
closure O
on O
the O
outside O
pockets O
. O

The O
battery O
is O
outstanding O
! O

But O
with O
switch O
1 O
down O
and O
switch O
2 O
up O
, O
It O
works O
on O
both O
the O
video O
and O
S O
- O
Video O
outputs O
. O

The O
Webcam O
works O
great O
, O
better O
then O
I O
expected O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hardware O
. O

Simple O
Product O
Perfect O
Result O
. O

I O
run O
two O
screens O
off O
the O
computer O
( O
laptop O
, O
flat O
panel O
) O
and O
a O
third O
portrait O
screen O
off O
the O
dock O
. O

I O
keep O
having O
to O
wake O
it O
up O
. O

In O
brief O
, O
one O
of O
the O
tricks O
that O
Lenovo O
pulls O
is O
to O
put O
out O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
not O
last O
even O
2 O
years O
, O
then O
retire O
the O
product O
before O
the O
majority O
of O
negative O
reviews O
pour O
in O
. O

Not O

For O
the O
past O
year O
or O
so O
I O
had O
coopted O
the O
trackpad O
to O
do O
the O
job O
of O
a O
numerical O
keypad O
with O
the O
use O
of O

I O
called O
into O
Schumacher O
when O
I O
found O
that O
the O
fan O
does O
not O
turn O
off O
while O
the O
unit O
is O
plugged O
into O
110/115v O
, O
even O
when O
maintaining O
" O

" O
charge O
on O
the O
batteries O
, O
but O
they O
said O
this O
is O
normal O
-- O
apparently O
the O
fan O
is O
never O
off O
, O
and O
draws O
about O
1A O

C. O
as O
it O
runs O
. O

even O
though O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
, O
i O
feel O
that O
the O
asus O
is O
tailored O
towards O
the O
casual O
user O
that O
actually O
needs O
graphics O
power O
over O
processing O
power O
. O

and O
I O
wanted O
something O
small O
with O
a O
USB O
charger O
. O

Why O
such O
a O
long O
review O
for O
a O
silly O
sleeve O
? O

It O
's O
also O
quite O
stylish O
and O
handy O
to O
carry O
. O

The O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
pain O
though O
. O

Will O
end O
up O
costing O
me O
more O
money O
to O
return O
it O
. O

And O
I O
've O
charged O
it O
up O
with O
my O
ps3 O
and O
my O
iPhone O
charger O
, O
many O
possibilities O

in O
all O

Laptop O

so O
I O
needed O
one O
of O
these O
. O

All O
this O
is O
extremely O
LIGHT O
compared O
to O
my O
prior O
Dell O
case O
, O
probably O
because O
it O
was O
leather O
and O
heavy O
to O
start O
with O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
attache O
drive O
for O
4 O
years O
now O
, O
and O
it O
still O
works O
great O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
TV O
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
amazed O
at O
the O
sound O
this O
little O
& O
# O
34;ball&#34 O
; O
provides O
. O

Has O
a O
nice O
shade O
of O
blue O
and O
snaps O
on O
... O
a O
bit O
to O
get O
it O
on O
there O

Easy O
to O
switch O
from O
left O
/ O
right O
( O
big O
deal O
for O
me O
since O
I O
'm O
a O
lefty O
) O
. O

I O
use O
this O
in O
my O
car O
at O
work O
when O
I O
have O
to O
work O
the O
night O
shift O
. O

this O
one O
is O
very O
light O
, O
compact O

I O
do O
wish O
the O
fabric O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
non O
- O
slip O
or O
there O
were O
some O
sort O
of O
indentations O
or O
risers O
to O
keep O
the O
laptop O
in O
place O
. O

I O
have O
nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
it O
so O
far O
, O
only O
good O
things O
! O

I O
'm O
continually O
doing O
them O
then O
undoing O
them O
. O

Considering O
WD O
's O
design O
, O
this O
Sabrent O
enclosure O
is O
basically O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

This O
laptop O
case O
is O
very O
sturdy O
as O
the O
other O
reviewers O
have O
stated O
. O

Very O
small O
, O
very O
portable O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
those O
stinkin O
' O
bulbs O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
anything O
in O
terms O
of O
updates O
, O
security O
and O
synchronization O
. O

Poor O
quality O
. O

Note O
: O
shipping O
is O
slow O
at O
about O
2 O
weeks O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
do O
nt O
need O
the O

has O
seen O
daily O
use O
, O
runs O
almost O
continuosly O
and O
to O
date O
it O
is O
still O
running O
perfectly O
. O

I O
really O
hate O
the O
way O
it O
's O
laid O
out O
. O

I O
have O
to O
unplug O
the O
network O
device O
and O
re O

plug O
it O
in O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O

, O
and O
did O
I O
remember O
to O
mention O
cheap?- O
goose O
- O
neck O
is O
not O
very O
stiff O
so O
the O
product O
droops O
a O
little O
and O
you O
must O
set O
it O
higher O
than O
you O
want O
it O
to O
end O
upI O
use O
it O
on O
a O
computer O
above O
a O
keyboard O
tray O
that O
controls O
an O
electron O

The O
speed O

is O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
bloatware O
put O
on O
by O
dell O

Warm O

of O

nothing O

Give O
your O

your O

My O
last O
sleeve O

zipper O
always O
tended O
to O
get O
stuck O
on O
the O
corners O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
just O
about O
every O
option O
possible O
on O
the O
sides O
including O
4 O
USB O
ports O
, O

, O

among O
other O
things O
. O

I O
followed O
iFixIt O
's O
guide O
. O

and O
it O
is O
much O
more O
affordable O
than O
the O
branded O
one O
. O

Default O
is O
to O
extend O
the O
desktop O
but O
for O
some O
strange O
reason O
( O
or O
maybe O
this O
is O
my O
first O
time O
) O
- O
if O
you O
extend O

play O

I O

are O
supported O
finally O
( O
they O
were O
not O
in O
the O
beta O
test O
of O
the O
CR-48).10 O
. O

I O
wanted O
this O
one O
for O
uninterrupted O
power O
during O
air O
travel O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
small O
carry O
on O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
a O
pull O
behind O
with O
the O
option O
to O
carry O
as O
a O
back O
pack O
. O

But O
IF O
NOT O
-We O
are O
going O
to O
disable O
IPv6 O
on O
all O
adapters O
. O

Over O
all O
I O
give O
this O
product O
5 O
stars O
! O
! O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
my O
wife O
a O
new O
case O
for O
her O
camera O
equipment O
, O
but O
thought O
it O
best O
to O
let O
her O
pick O
out O
what O
appealed O
to O
her O
. O

So O
I O
started O
to O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
found O
good O
and O
bad O
reviews O
, O
more O
of O
them O
good O
then O
bad O
. O

Not O
sure O
why O
, O
just O
personal O
preference O
, O
but O
I O
really O
do O
like O
the O
feel O
and O
the O
response O
. O

Windows O
8 O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
get O
accustomed O
to O
but O
after O
a O
learning O
period O
I O
just O
love O
it O
. O

The O
mouse O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
, O
its O
is O
super O
sensitive O
. O

It O
's O
a O
lot O
cheaper O
. O

It O
is O
a O
super O
- O
stable O
system O
. O

Great O
Price O
and O
Convenient O
. O

I O
'm O
assumed O
it O
was O
a O
defective O
card O
. O

One O
minor O
irritation O
is O
that O
Logitech O
installs O
a O
Yahoo O
toolbar O
along O
with O
the O
software O
which O
I O
feel O
was O
unnecessary O
. O

They O
're O
not O
stretchy O
, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
to O
fit O
some O
items O
in O
them O
, O
as O
flat O
and O
taut O
as O
they O
are O
, O
hence O
the O
4 O

Youtube O
and O
streaming O
video O
can O
have O
problems O
sometimes O
... O
audio O
and O
video O

I O
just O
discover O
that O
when O
I O
came O
back O
to O
Brazil O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
scenario O
would O
work O
only O
if O
AirPort O
Express O
is O
acting O
as O
a O
remote O
base O
station O
( O
via O
WDS O
) O
instead O
of O
Internet O
gateway O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
after O
I O
upgraded O
my O
router O
to O
an O
AC O
router O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
increased O
WIFI O
speeds O
. O

The O
ATIV O
has O
wonderful O
battery O
life O
: O
easily O
lasts O
for O
a O
whole O
day O
of O
any O
use O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
find O
for O
it O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
air O
it O
out O
for O
a O
few O
days O
, O
the O
smell O
goes O
away O
. O

However O
, O
I O
was O
impressed O
by O
the O
reviews O
of O
the O
TX2510us O
, O
and O
after O
trying O
it O
out O
and O
finally O
buying O
it O
, O
it O
is O
a O
terrific O
little O
machine O
. O

Here O
are O
my O
findings O
: O
ClarityHDPROS O
: O

I O
am O
really O
surprised O
by O
this O
OS O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
iEraser O
. O

The O
stock O
graphics O
card O
is O
garbage O
, O
so O
plan O
on O
spending O
$ O
100 O
to O
replacing O
it O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
any O
gaming O
( O
Skyrim O
/ O
Farcry O
/ O
etc).One O
minor O
annoyance O
is O
that O
the O
power O
button O
is O
on O
the O
top O
corner O
of O
the O
side O
of O
the O
tower O
near O
the O
button O
to O
open O
the O
CD O
tray O
instead O
of O
in O
front O
or O
on O
top O
, O
so O
that O
may O
require O
you O
to O
think O
about O
where O
you O
place O
it O
. O

this O
was O
definitely O
a O
good O
investment O
. O

They O
keyboard O
is O
small O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
setup O
. O

this O
way O
my O
guests O
can O
configure O
it O
any O
way O
they O
would O
like O
and O
a O
full O
restore O
is O
jsut O
a O
reboot O
away O

Daisy O
chaining O
multiple O
XBooms O
together O
the O
sound O
just O
gets O
richer O
and O
fuller O
. O

It O
has O
an O
adjustable O
shoulder O
strap O
and O
two O
side O
clasp O
locks O
to O
keep O
it O
closed O
. O

A O
great O
external O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
DVDRW O
device O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
money O
. O

" O
I O
have O
been O
real O
pleased O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
to O
me O
. O

The O
N52 O
original O
- O
Good O
for O
first O
pad O
, O
but O
Dpad O
is O
stiff O
and O
hard O
to O
manuever O

But O
so O
far O
it O
works O
fine O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

And O
expect O
this O
to O
happen O
a O
lot O
, O
if O
you O
accidentally O
tilt O
the O
screen O
even O
a O
little O
. O

You O
may O
end O
up O
with O
a O
duplicate O
product O
just O
like O
me O
. O

I O
was O
kind O
of O
disappointed O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
use O
touch O
to O
make O
a O
drawing O
on O
Google O
Drive O
. O

Forgot O
the O
sound O
was O
turned O
off O
on O
it O
when O
I O
got O
it O
, O
thought O
something O
was O
wrong O
till O
I O
went O
to O
system O
folder O
and O
turn O
the O
audio O
on O
, O
why O
they O
would O
ship O
it O
with O
not O
turned O
on O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

and O
it O
sounded O
like O
the O
bass O
was O
coming O
from O
my O
monitor O
which O
was O
great O
. O

The O
cooler O
has O
two O
different O
speed O
settings O
, O
controlled O
by O
a O
little O
wheel O
on O
the O
right O
. O

Simply O
turn O
the O
speaker O
on O
, O
and O
be O
delighted O
with O
the O
incredible O
sound O
that O
it O
puts O
out O
. O

This O
recharger O
works O
well O
on O
both O
my O
Kindle O
and O
my O
Kindle O
paper O
white O
. O

The O
glowing O
reviews O
would O
lead O
you O
to O
believe O
that O
you O
could O
waltz O
into O
a O
business O
meeting O
with O
this O
bag O
and O
feel O
confident O
about O
your O
professional O
appearance O
. O

A O
problem O
for O
me O
has O
been O
the O
software O
and O
operating O
system O
that O
comes O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
so O
transparent O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
I O
have O
n't O
learned O
anything O
about O
Linux O
! O

Just O
used O
for O
school O
and O
work O
. O

I O
must O
admit O
I O
was O
sure O
this O
will O
be O
a O
dud O
.... O

Great O
case O
to O
protect O
my O
camera O
and O
lenses O
when O
I O
travel O
. O

This O
blows O
them O
all O
away O
. O

3 O
stars O
, O
this O
product O
does O
not O
deserve O
more O
. O

Construction O
is O
superb O
. O

Also O
does O
not O
cause O
scratches O
on O
the O
case O
of O
the O
item O
you O
are O
working O
with O
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
its O
innovative O
hinge O
design O
that O
allows O
the O
screen O
to O
swivel O
180 O
degrees O
and O
collapse O
onto O
the O
keyboard O
. O

So O
whatever O
your O
lightmeter O
is O
reading O
, O
I O
would O
step O
down O
about O
1/3 O
stop O
more O
to O
preserve O
the O
highlight O
details.- O
Bitrate O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
the O
more O
expensive O
white O
model O
due O
to O
the O
faster O
processor O
, O
1 O
GB O
memory O
standard O
which O
is O
in O
my O
honest O
opinion O
is O
a O
minimum O
requirement O
with O
Apple O
, O
and O
the O
superdrive O
, O
plus O
some O
smaller O
upgraded O
cache O
features O
. O

The O
fan O
is O
also O
too O
weak O
. O

You O
can O
be O
watching O
TV O
and O
just O
press O
" O
Play O
" O
and O
the O
DVD O
will O
play O
. O

would O
recommend O
it O
to O
any O
one O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
projector O
to O
conduct O
a O
working O
session O
, O
especially O
if O
it O
involves O
numbers O
such O
as O
using O
Excel O
as O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
read O
unless O
you O
increase O
the O
magnification O
view O
in O
Excel O
to O
an O
impractical O
size O
. O

This O
case O
is O
not O
only O
durable O
but O
looks O
and O
feels O
good O
. O

A O
note O
on O
Buffalo O
's O
tech O
support O
: O
Buffalo O
's O
forum O
is O
a O
nice O
attempt O
by O
its O
users O
to O
help O
each O
other O
out O
( O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
in O
my O
case O
, O
or O
many O
many O
other O
cases O
judging O
from O
the O
unresolved O
help O
requests O
there O
) O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
type O
very O
long O
documents O
because O
of O
the O
small O
keyboard O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
good O
laptop O
. O

Now O
what O
rules O
about O
this O
monitor O
is O
the O
screen&#8230 O
; O
What O
you O
notice O
immediately O
is O
that O
it O
is O
like O
a O
1 O
- O
1/2 O
inch O
bevel O
which O
is O
a O
little O
wide O

--I O
could O
n't O
correct O
the O
coloration O
enough O
to O
make O
it O
functional O
for O
higher O
quality O
photo O
editing O
. O

It O
charges O
with O
the O
included O
USB O
cord O
so O
you O
will O
need O
to O
plug O
it O
into O
your O
computer O
, O
wall O
charger O
or O
maybe O
a O
USB O
hub O
to O
charge O
it O
. O

No O
more O
sweaty O
back O
when O
huffing O
through O
an O
airport- O
Small O
top O
pocket O
that O
holds O
quick O
access O
items O
like O
iPod O
, O
keys O
, O
sunglasses O
, O
etc.- O
Solid O
top O
handle- O

I O
've O
been O
anti O
apple O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
even O
for O
me O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
just O
too O
good O
to O
pass O
up O
on O
. O

The O
TV O
has O
numerous O
picture O
settings O
, O
sure O
to O
please O
any O
TV O
enthusiast O
. O

Each O
is O
designed O
to O
serve O
a O
different O
purpose O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
also O
connect O
hard O
drives O
on O
this O
device O
. O

: O
I O
wrote O
this O
review O
with O
my O
husband O
who O
is O
a O
photojournalist O
. O

I O
was O
very O
excited O
when O
I O
found O
this O
one O
. O

This O
is O
MUCH O
cheaper O
than O
those O
crappy O
products O
Monster O
and O
other O
companies O
are O
selling O
. O

So O
unless O
you O
are O
doing O
some O
crazy O
insane O
intense O
data O
transferring O
for O
a O
project O
, O
work O
, O
etc O
. O

On O
my O
laptop O
, O
a O
modem O
sits O
right O
below O
the O
mounting O
for O
the O
WiFi O
adapter O
, O
so O
masking O
tape O
is O
there O
already O
to O
prevent O
either O
screw O
from O
making O
contact O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
distributes O
the O
laptop O
's O
weight O
over O
a O
little O
larger O
area O
on O
your O
lap O
making O
use O
of O
a O
heavier O
unit O
a O
little O
more O
comfortable O
. O

For O
some O
devices O
, O
the O
user O
manual O
comes O
with O
a O
code O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
entered O
after O
you O
turn O
on O
the O
bluetooth O
feature O
on O
the O
devices O
being O
paired O
. O

Q O
; O
Look O
at O
you O
headphones O
like O
a O
guitar O
. O

The O
spindle O
at O
the O
base O
of O
the O
stand O
meant O
for O
winding O
your O
cord O
around O
is O
extremely O
slender O
, O
and O
is O
ill O
- O
suited O
for O
anything O
less O
than O
5 O
meters O
of O
cable O
( O
and O
less O
flexible O
cable O
which O
may O
become O
warped O
or O
damaged O
from O
being O
wound O
tightly O
) O
. O

These O
are O
great O
speakers O
for O
the O
size O
and O
the O
money O
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
I O
now O
have O
two O
working O
power O
bricks O
for O
the O
future O
, O
in O
case O
I O
ever O
lose O
one O
of O
them O
again O
or O
one O
of O
them O
stops O
working O
. O

Great O
fit O
! O

THEN O
the O
pixel O
got O
bigger O
, O
the O
right O
speaker O
went O
completely O
dead O
on O
both O
headphones O
and O
external O
( O
blew O
out O
one O
of O
his O
headphones O
) O
, O
the O
multi O
- O
touch O
zoom O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
the O
backlight O
wo O
n't O
change O
manually O
or O
with O
buttons O
( O
it O
'll O
stay O
dim O
until O
you O
restart O
it O
) O
, O
it O
got O
much O
slower O
after O
the O
first O
few O
days O
, O
and O
there O
are O
probably O
more O
problems O
that O
we O
are O
n't O
aware O
about O
. O

no O
I O
do O
n't O
work O
for O
Utech O
... O
yet O
;) O

I O
tuck O
one O
side O
of O
the O
zipper O
inside O
of O
the O
pack O

I O
really O
enjoy O
the O
butterfly O
on O
the O
laptop O
instead O
of O
the O
logo O
. O

Onto O
the O
screen O
now O
. O

Unfortunately O
there O
was O
n't O
that O
many O
reviews O
going O
around O
about O
it O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
also O
has O
Dolby O
Digital O
5 O
. O
1 O
, O
DTS O
, O
and O
much O
more O
. O

Was O
a O
great O
price O
. O

I O
refused O
it O
and O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
Amazon O
. O

This O
CaseLogic O
is O
just O
about O
perfect O
, O
nice O
snug O
fit O
with O
good O
protection O
, O
Caselogic O
Neoprene O

. O

The O

and O
webcam O
presentation O
are O
clear O
and O
distinct O
. O

My O
ipad O
and O
phone O
has O
never O
looked O
cleaner O
! O

My O
wife O
has O
had O
a O
G5 O
for O
the O
past O
4 O
years O
with O
no O
problems O
, O
while O
I O
have O
been O
through O
at O
least O
3 O
Windows O
machines O
and O
AV O
programs O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
very O
good O
. O

I O
just O
got O
this O
today O
, O
so O
I O
've O
only O
been O
able O
to O
test O
it O
with O
an O
External O
USB O
3 O
drive O
( O
which O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
it O
) O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
this O
cover O
and O
company!!Thank O
you O
! O
! O
! O

And O
I O
'm O
not O
asking O
for O
anything O
. O

This O
level O
mounts O
in O
the O
hot O
shoe O
of O
your O
camera O
and O
makes O
leveling O
the O
camera O
a O
breeze O
. O

I O
actually O
hang O
the O
cables O
by O
a O
loop O
in O
the O
coils O
and O
charge O
devices O
while O
they O
are O
stowed O
along O
the O
cabinet O
walls O
by O
the O
bungees O
, O
so O
when O
unplugged O
they O
are O
already O
hanging O
and O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

so O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
download O
any O
software O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
computing O
in O
the O
bed O
is O
hardly O
productive O
. O

it O
slips O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
cradle O
easily O
. O

This O
power O
supply O
has O
enough O
cords O
and O
cables O
to O
work O
on O
any O
system O
that O
I O
am O
likely O
to O
build O
. O

There O
are O
better O
made O
and O
designed O
stands O
for O
the O
user O
. O

My O
13inMBP2012 O
got O
almost O
6 O
h. O

This O
is O
in O
the O
main O
compartment O
, O
which O
also O
has O
a O
book O
sized O
pocket O
on O
the O
flap O
. O

For O
me O
, O
5 O
feet O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
. O

Another O
thing O
that O
bugged O
me O
was O
that O
this O
was O
made O
of O
polyester O
. O

The O
first O
is O
there O
should O
be O
a O
light O
on O
the O
box O
to O
represent O
landline O
connection O
. O

As O
fast O
as O
electronics O
change O
, O
might O
as O
well O
have O
the O
newest O
one O
on O
the O
market O
. O

Who O
would O
n't O
want O
it O
though O
? O

I O
have O
requested O
that O
Samsung O
refund O
my O
money O
.... O

I O
bought O
this O
as O
additional O
RAM O
for O
my O
samsung O
series O
5 O
ultra O
laptop O
. O

Fine O
as O
a O
surge O
protector O
or O
to O
add O
additional O
outlets O
but O
wo O
n't O
charge O
IPad O
via O
USB O
. O

So O
it O
folds O
like O
down O
into O
your O
lap O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
sturdy O
. O

This O
cable O
from O
BlueRigger O
is O
of O
the O
same O
great O
quality O
as O
all O
of O
their O
other O
items O
I O
have O
purchased O
. O

However O
, O
not O
all O
laptops O
have O
USB O
on O
the O
left O
side O
, O
but O
there O
are O
n't O
many O
. O

However O
, O
they O
suffer O
from O
interference O
problems O
. O

it O
's O
some O
aetheros O
adapter O
with O
not O
very O
good O
drivers O
to O
go O
with O
it O
. O

I O
believe O
in O
quality O
over O
quantity O
and O
this O
product O
represents O
that O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
faster O
, O
more O
simple O
upgrade O
than O
snapping O
in O
new O
RAM O
? O

These O
provide O
great O
cleaning O
from O
eye O
glasses O
to O
smartphones O
. O

This O
little O
product O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
charge O
, O
and O
use O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
Kiwi O
250 O
GB O
model O
. O

7200rpm O
HDD O
, O
the O
Asus O
a O
larger O
5400rpm O
500gb O
... O
winner O
= O
your O
choice O
. O

Who O
knows O
, O
who O
cares O
. O

What O
attracted O
me O
to O
this O
mouse O
in O
the O
first O
place O
is O
the O
miniature O
USB O
receiver O
/ O
transmitter O
. O

I O
have O
an O
older O
optical O
MX O
mouse O
for O
my O
desktop O
and O
enjoyed O
its O
convenience O
buttons O
. O

Just O
getting O
comfortable O
when O
it O
went O
dark O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
product O
! O

Bought O
this O
to O
carry O
on O
my O
travels O
to O
charge O
my O
USB O
items O
without O
having O
to O
bring O
each O
transformer O
with O
me O
. O

The O
USB O
micro O
cable O
works O
just O
like O
it O
should O
. O

A O
little O
bit O
( O
around O
$ O
400 O
) O
overpriced O
as O
compared O
to O
others O
laptops O
with O
same O
configuration O
, O
but O
if O
money O
is O
not O
your O
problem O
, O
then O
a O
must O
buy O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
about O
3 O
feet O
long O
. O

I O
opened O
up O
the O
reader O
and O
noticed O
that O
the O
connector O
is O
held O
onto O
the O
circuit O
board O
with O
solder O
and O
nothing O
else O
, O
making O
this O
connection O
very O
weak O
and O
prone O
to O
detachment O
. O

Spoiled O
, O
just O
ordering O
a O
new O
Samsung O
19 O
" O
for O
my O
bedroom O
. O

Wish O
the O
touchpad O
gestures O
were O
more O
configurable O
to O
what O
they O
do O
.. O
have O
n't O
looked O
into O
it O
too O
much O
though- O
hard O
drive O
is O
a O
slow O
5400rpm O
, O
probably O
replace O
with O
a O
hybrid.- O
heavy O
for O
the O
size O
4 O
. O

The O
functionality O
of O
tablet O
is O
my O
second O
concern O
when O
price O
does O
n't O
add O
much O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
the O
only O
disadvantage O
of O
this O
type O
of O
product O
vs. O
a O
plug O
- O
in O
card O
or O
USB O
box O
is O
that O
you O
must O
chooses O
if O
you O
want O
CATV O
or O
OTA O
HDTV O
, O
since O
many O
of O
the O
cards O
and O
USB O
boxes O
offer O
separate O
F O
- O
connectors O
for O
cable O
and O
OTA O
signals O
. O

( O
see O
my O
other O
reviews O
) O

Forewarning O
, O
the O
area O
to O
remove O
/ O
change O
the O
RAM O
is O
just O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
the O
actual O
RAM O
chip O
, O
so O
be O
very O
careful O
not O
to O
force O
the O
old O
RAM O
out O
and O
the O
new O
RAM O
in O
. O

Most O
of O
these O
3rd O
party O
batteries O
are O
made O
with O
the O
absolute O
cheapest O
Chinese O
- O
made O
cells O
the O
manufacture O
can O
find O
, O
not O
the O
somewhat O
more O
expensive O
but O
far O
higher O
quality O
Japanese O
- O
made O
cells O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
a O
down O
fall O
is O
the O
open O
and O
closing O
it O
. O

Sliding O
in O
the O
HDD O
requires O
a O
bit O
of O
delicate O
positioning O
to O
get O
it O
to O
connect O
. O

If O
I O
add O
my O
external O
hard O
drive O
to O
it O
, O
the O
cover O
would O
have O
bumpy O
round O
look O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

So O
Acer O
's O
placement O
and O
structure O
of O
the O
physical O
part O
of O
the O
adapter O
is O
good O
also O
, O
ie O
the O
" O
antenna O
" O
is O
routed O
through O
the O
little O
chassis O
strategically O
, O
apparently O
( O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
discover O
it O
by O
taking O
it O
apart O
, O
but O
will O
soon O
! O
) O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
strong O
network O
performer O
, O
which O
is O
essential O
in O
a O
notebook O
/ O
netbook O
. O

This O
one O
is O
difficult O
to O
not O
only O
size O
( O
and O
putting O
on O
a O
different O
size O
cap O
is O
pretty O
darn O
difficult O
) O
but O
just O
is O
not O
as O
good O
at O
staying O
in O
place O
even O
when O
sized O
correctly O
. O

Of O
course O
you O
need O
a O
HD O
docking O
station O
like O
the O
Vantec O
but O
this O
worked O
perfectly O
for O
me O
. O

The O
Livescribe O
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

It O
's O
also O
gone O
with O
me O
as O
a O
carry O
- O
on O
on O
several O
plane O
trips O
. O

Measures O
X O
" O
x O
X O
" O
x O
X O
" O
. O

The O
plastic O
inputs O
are O
quality O
but O
the O
cable O
is O
very O
crappy O
, O
but O
I O
should O
n't O
be O
complaining O
since O
it O
was O
like O
$ O
5 O
anyways O
. O

All O
of O
the O
elastic O
has O
rubber O
built O
into O
it O
( O
visible O
as O
light O
grey O
lines O
through O
the O
elastic O
in O
the O
pictures O
) O
, O
which O
does O
a O
fantastic O
job O
of O
holding O
slippery O
metal O
or O
plastic O
items O
firmly O
in O
place O
. O

On O
a O
whim O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
lil O
guy O
out O
, O
as O
it O
was O
$ O
50 O
cheaper O
, O
smaller O
, O
and O
had O
the O
Celeron O
353 O
processor O
, O
which O
most O
people O
think O
is O
inferior O
to O
the O
Atom O
as O
far O
as O
performance O
is O
concerned O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
decent O
wireless O
optical O
mouse O
and O
it O
is O
priced O
attractively O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
dual O
card O
slots O
, O
which O
allow O
me O
to O
download O
directly O
to O
the O
unit O
without O
having O
to O
go O
through O
a O
CPU O
. O

but O
I O
've O
heard O
better O
sounding O
portable O
Bluetooth O
speakers O

I O
tried O
different O
songs O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
was O
n't O
something O
to O
do O
with O
that O
, O
but O
it O
just O
seems O
to O
do O
better O
at O
a O
higher O
volume O
with O
a O
computer O
and O
the O
adapter O
. O

Some O
people O
just O
do O
n't O
like O
having O
the O
ear O
buds O
that O
go O
into O
your O
ear O
and O
want O
the O
external O
type O
headphones O
- O
just O
know O
that O
these O
really O
do O
go O
into O
your O
ear O
. O

That O
did O
n't O
suit O
me O
either O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
monitor O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
high O
quality O
, O
ultra O
thin O
, O
LED O
backlit O
screen O
for O
your O
computer O
. O

Sounds O
come O
out O
nicely O
and O
have O
nice O
bass O
style O
. O

No O
sense O
in O
buying O
something O
to O
write O
on O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
write O
on O
it O
. O

great O
price O
and O
for O
once O
a O
seller O
that O
advertises O
specs O
correctly O
on O
power O
adapters O
- O
this O
one O
fits O
the O
ROKU O
1st O
gen O
100 O
% O
perfect O
with O
exact O
power O
requirements O
- O
helped O
me O
to O
revive O
2 O
dead O
units O
after O
3 O
months O
in O
place O
of O
buying O
brand O
new O
ones O

I O
recommended O
and O
purchased O
this O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

after O
different O
models O
I O
found O
out O
they O
were O
too O
small O
. O

If O
you O
're O
on O
a O
budget O
, O
this O
will O
be O
the O
pack O
that O
I O
'd O
probably O
recommend O
. O

Tough O
to O
choose O
from O
so O
many O
products O
. O

BOTTOM O
LINE:--Very O
glad O
we O
upgraded O
my O
wife O

Because O
of O
this:- O
it O
will O
not O
charge O
while O
ON O
( O
operating).- O
will O
not O
charge O
from O
a O
standard O
computer O

only O

make O
sure O
any O

built O
for O
the O
TF300.(I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
situation O
with O
the O
other O
TF O
series O
, O
but O
assume O
it O
's O
the O
same O
. O
) O

I O
hate O
plugging O
this O
into O
my O
external O
monitor O
for O
dual O
screen O
just O
because O
of O
how O
beautiful O
it O
is O
. O

As O
mentioned O
by O
others O
, O
the O
in O
- O
use O
battery O
life O
is O
very O
poor O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
HP O
fixed O
the O
problem O
or O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
using O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
same O
conditions O
as O
those O
with O
the O
complaints O
, O
but O
I O
can O
see O
/ O
read O
them O
fine O
( O
I O
use O
the O
laptop O
indoors O
with O
ambient O
/ O
indirect O
sun O
lighting O
for O
the O
most O
part O
) O
. O

I O
have O
bought O
many O
different O
AmazonBasics O
cables O
, O
and O
all O
have O
been O
great O
quality O
. O

The O
headphone O
was O
not O
compatible O
with O
my O
laptop O
at O
all O
. O

Works O
well O
with O
mouse O
and O
headphones O
. O

Each O
pixel O
row O
is O
darker O
or O
lighter O
than O
it O
's O
neighboring O
pixel O
rows O
. O

Spend O
a O
few O
more O
dollars O
, O
and O
get O
a O
better O
Bluetooth O
adapter O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
one O
that O
is O
truly O
as O
small O
as O
I O
want O
it O
( O
it O
is O
for O
travel O
, O
after O
all O
) O
with O
three O
120v O
and O
2 O
USB O
ports O
. O

Supposedly O
, O
Sony O
is O
working O
on O
a O
fix O
though O
not O
all O
their O
stores O
and O
call O
centers O
are O
familiar O
with O
it O
. O

The O

site O

globasat O
is O

given O
a O

build O
quality O
is O
awesome O
though O
. O

Last O
year O
I O
bought O
another O
charger O
for O
around O
10 O
bucks O
to O
replace O
the O
original O
cord O
that O
came O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

That O
is O
a O
definite O
plus O
. O

The O
battery O
I O
received O
is O
NOT O
a O
Toshiba O
battery O
though O
the O
description O
for O
this O
item O
does O
not O
state O
" O
generic O
replacement O
" O
or O
" O
replacement O
for O
" O
. O

It O
's O
especially O
frustrating O
on O
laptops O
where O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
slide O
in O
a O
new O
card O
. O

I O
can O
handle O
failures O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
seller O
does O
whatever O
is O
needed O
to O
fix O
the O
problem O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
into O
it O
atm O
to O
see O
if O
I O
could O
find O
a O
remedy O
. O

It O
interfaces O
very O
easily O
with O
my O
Galaxy O
Note O
2 O
, O
but O
the O
range O
is O
n't O
that O
great O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remove O
the O
hard O
drive O
to O
protect O
confidential O
data O
. O

I O
mistype O
less O
on O
full O
size O
keys O
than O
island O
style O
chiclet O
keys O
. O

There O
is O
a O
BIOS O
update O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
battery O
life O
, O
but O
nothing O
extreme***As O
far O
as O
the O
WiFi O
goes O
, O
I O
have O
noticed O
that O
my O
connection O
is O
n't O
as O
powerful O
, O
and O
I O
may O
replace O
the O
card O
like O
other O
users O
have O
. O

They O
hold O
a O
ton O
of O
pictures O
and O
they O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
copying O
the O
data O
over O
then O
reformatting O
them O
over O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Affordable O
adapters O
that O
work O
for O
extending O
or O
converting O
with O
HDMI O
, O
micro- O
, O
or O
mini O
- O
HDMI O
these O
will O
fit O
most O
of O
your O
needs O
. O

Much O
faster O
opening O
up O

and O
running O
multiple O
programs O
at O
once O
. O

After O
doing O
a O
search O
on O
Amazon O
for O
magic O
microfiber O
cloths O
I O
found O
these O
, O
Yep O
.. O
these O
are O
the O
same O
one O
's O
. O

The O
C720 O
is O
definitely O
a O
second O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
best O
web O
based O
device O
to O
have O
. O

We O
plugged O
it O
in O
to O
use O
it O
and O
within O
5 O
minutes O
of O
our O
first O
use O
, O
it O
got O
very O
hot O
and O
started O
smoking O
. O

Some O
keys O
are O
not O
quite O
straight O

Great O

it O
is O
amazing O
how O
good O
a O
youtube O
video O
can O
look O
even O
if O
you O
DONT O
export O
in O

. O

Unlike O
my O
other O
backpacks O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
look O
dirty O
and O
scuffed O
on O
the O
bottom O
even O
after O
heavy O
use O
. O

I O
can O
store O
the O
netbook O
in O
its O
zipper O
case O
with O
the O
receiver O
plugged O
in O
. O

This O
cuts O
down O
on O
the O
cords O
needed O
for O
the O
speaker O

It O
was O
pretty O
much O
" O
plug O

play O

after O
selecting O
that O
the O

a O

and O
i O
was O
hopeing O
this O
we O
can O
use O

it O

Lightning O
fast O

listen O
to O
the O
other O

's O
comment O
which O
stated O
that O
it O
only O
works O
with O
the O
padding O
it O
comes O
with O

I O
can O
stream O

I O
also O
have O
a O

is O

on O
the O
best O
ultraportable O
out O
there O
for O
the O
price O
of O

850 O

In O
the O
past O
she O
would O
never O
use O
the O
laptop O
on O
her O

on O
our O
couch O
. O

And O
clicking O
the O
button O
areas O
at O
the O

of O
the O

takes O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
, O
more O
than O

should O
. O

and O
I O
also O
used O
it O
to O
travel O
around O
Europe O
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
did O
not O
fit O
perfectly O
, O
and O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
put O
it O
in O
or O
pull O
it O
out O
of O
the O
laptop O
's O
slot O
. O

I O
've O
been O
completely O
satisfied O
with O
. O

I O
logged O
onto O
the O
router O
and O
the O
first O
thing O
it O
did O
was O
update O
itself O
. O

Tight O
fit O
but O
does O
the O
job O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
" O
menu O
" O
button O
does O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
when O
the O
AUX O
input O
is O
being O
used O
. O

I O
think O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
earlier O
because O
I O
was O
between O
2 O
large O
condos O
. O

Delivery O
was O
fast O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

" O
It O
's O
very O
hard O
to O
know O
if O
you O
really O
have O
more O
power O
, O
but O
your O
brain O
thinks O
you O
do O
! O

Fast O
enough O
... O

While O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
Chrome O
apps O
to O
choose O
from O
, O
none O
are O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
commercially O
available O
ones- O

It O
's O
not O
Bose O
of O
course O

I O
used O
it O
for O
a O
recent O
trip O
to O
Vancouver O
& O
Alaska O
to O
carry O
my O
Sony O
NEX-5N O
w/ O

very O
disapointed O
in O
this O
battery O
. O

It O
's O
jus O
a O
bit O
to O
small O
for O
my O
hand O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
they O
where O
discounted O
by O
the O
manufacture O
early O
2012 O
. O

I O
expected O
to O
see O
some O
issues O
with O
wireless O
connectivity O
, O
there O
were O
none O
. O

I O
am O
much O
happier O
about O
MAC O
OS O
and O
have O
just O
bought O
an O
iMac O
for O
office O
. O

I O
can O
read O
my O
keyboard O
in O
very O
low O
light O
conditions O
after O
using O
these O
. O

The O
first O
case O
was O
rooCase O
model O
number O
RC O
- O
TF101-MA O
- O
BK O
( O
as O
pictured O
and O
described O
) O
. O

This O
bothered O
me O
at O
first O
, O
but O
once O
I O
realized O
that O
if O
I O
'm O
close O
enough O
to O
read O
the O
menus O
I O
'm O
close O
enough O
to O
use O
my O
finger O
on O
the O
iPhone O
screen O
instead O
of O
the O
remote O
. O

His O
choice O
of O
delivery O
people O
made O
his O
buyers O
comfortable O
. O

It O
just O
does O
n't O
charge O
anything O
anymore O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
put O
a O
Tamron O
10 O
- O
24 O
or O
a O
Tokina O
11 O
- O
16 O
in O
there O
soon O
. O

Looks O
beautiful O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
those O
two O
- O
sided O
tapes O
pasted O
at O
four O
corners O
of O
this O
pad O
, O
so O
that O
my O
note O
does O
n't O
slip O
out O
from O
it O
. O

I O
DID O
TO O
KEEP O
THE O
HEADPHONE O
WIRES O

There O
are O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
docking O
stations O
available O
. O

happily O
, O
the O
good O
amazon O
people O
reimbursed O
me O
- O
bottom O
part O
and O
optical O
drive O
exterior O
case O
is O
made O
of O
quite O
cheap O
plastic O
which O
is O
in O
sharp O
contrast O
to O
fantastic O
bamboo O
finish O
- O
Asus O
add O
- O
on O
software O

Would O
definitely O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
little O
more O
length O
in O
their O
charger O
. O

Still O
, O
it O
is O
n't O
a O
bad O
flash O
drive O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
convient O
buy O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
an O
excellent O
organizer O
and O
hold O
everything O
I O
need O
. O

I O
find O
most O
useful O
the O
percentage O
of O
my O
CPU O
and O
Ram O
being O
used O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
interesting O
to O
see O
while O
you O
're O
playing O
games O
that O
take O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
both O
. O

I O
brought O
three O
Asus O
WL O
- O
ANT-157 O
Antennas O
. O

When O
compared O
with O
other O
cheaper O
locks O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
this O
lock O
really O
shows O
. O

And O
I O
do O

Adding O
this O
memory O
to O
a O
memory O
challenged O
( O
512 O
MB O
) O
laptop O
really O
improved O
the O
over O
- O
all O
performance O
of O
the O
machine O
and O
the O
irritating O
low O
memory O
reports O
are O
gone O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
end O
up O
throwing O
my O
power O
cord O
into O
either O
my O
purse O
of O
tote O
bag O
. O

This O
device O
does O
n't O
live O
up O
to O
that O
standard O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
perfectly O
. O

Best O
value O
for O
money O
. O

The O
sound O
from O
this O
little O
dock O
was O
very O
good O
. O

( O
1512 O
g O
) O
, O
compared O
to O
an O
iPad O
Air O
, O
which O
weighs O
much O
less O
than O
a O
third O
of O
that O
. O

While O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
short O
, O
I O
like O
that O

Although O
they O
are O
n't O
the O
latest O
and O
greatest O
installments O
, O
they O
are O
a O
nice O
touch O
, O
considering O
most O
laptops O
do O
n't O
even O
provide O
them O
. O

OR O
can O
be O
plugged O
in O
to O
a O
wall O
outlet O
with O
the O
included O
cable O
. O

When O
fullyt O
charge O
it O
give O
you O
around O
three O
hour O
of O
power O
so O
you O
can O
do O
any O
task O
with O
your O
notebook O
. O

REALLY O
I O
DONT O
LIKE O
, O

It O
installs O
with O
a O
snap O
( O
literally O
) O
and O
protects O
my O
precious O
Macbook O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
several O
different O
versions O
of O
Asus O
laptops O
since O
2008 O
and O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
every O
single O
one O
. O

Though O
the O
pocket O
entry O
is O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
the O
actual O
pocket O
resides O
inside O
the O
main O
compartment O
and O
I O
could O
see O
my O
glasses O
getting O
smashed O
inside O
unless O
I O
was O
n't O
carrying O
anything O
too O
bulky O
inside O
the O
main O
compartment O
. O

Works O
well O
enough O
, O
though O
low O
graphics O
capabilities O
, O
only O
128Mb O
... O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
plenty O
of O
room O
or O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
damaged O
cables O
. O

Since O
the O
screens O
are O
pretty O
tiny O
compared O
to O
regular O
laptops O
, O
I O
thought O
a O
little O
larger O
screen O
would O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
solution O
to O
either O
not O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
phone O
line O
and/or O
not O
having O
to O
carry O
your O

around O
whenever O
you O
move O
around O
your O
house O

this O
is O

priced O
for O
the O

it O
, O
and O
really O
it O
is O

I O

it O
more O

NoT O

it O

still O
in O
the O
top O

Not O
only O
do O
the O
fans O
engage O
less O
often O
, O
but O
electrical O
consumption O

reduced O

It O

not O

any O
serious O
side O

roomy O
internal O

( O
you O
might O
be O
able O

even O

This O

performs O
flawlessly O
and O
is O
priced O
right O

I O
went O
to O
the O

It O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
turn O
the O
LED O

on O
: O
it O
's O
a O
small O
wheel O
switch O
in O
the O

. O

I O
took O
a O
chance O
and O
ordered O
to O
of O
these O
memory O
modules O
and O
now O
my O
reports O
16 O

I O
decided O
to O
make O
a O
power O
supply O
for O
using O
my O
laptop O
in O
the O
car O
. O

Although O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
actually O
burn O
one O
, O
software O
seems O
relatively O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

Frankly O
my O
North O
Face O
backpack O
provides O
a O
heck O
of O
lot O
more O
room O
and O
protection O
, O
but O
if O
you O
like O
to O
travel O
light O
and O
want O
something O
you O
're O
comfortable O
with O
in O
a O
corporate O
environment O
, O
the O
iHome O
will O
do O
the O
job O
. O

There O
was O
no O
installation O
of O
anything O
to O
do O
... O

The O
audio O
made O
a O
huge O
jump O
though O
in O
quality O
and O
I O
had O
to O
turn O
the O
volume O
down O
significantly O
on O
HDMI O
when O
played O
through O
the O
TV O
speakers O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
charge O
that O
either O
! O
? O
! O
? O

There O
was O
nothing O
at O
all O
to O
the O
setup O
-- O
just O
plug O
in O
the O
USB O
connector O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
irritate O
a O
lot O
of O
tech O
savvy O
people O
. O

They O
were O
perfectly O
synced O
so O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
discern O
that O
you O
were O
listening O
to O
two O
sets O
of O
speakers O
. O

I O
am O
currently O
using O
with O
component O
cable O
until O
HDMI O
cable O
coming O
within O
couple O
of O
days O
. O

The O
mouse O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
nicely O
in O
your O
hand O
but O
functional O
enough O
to O
perform O
all O
necessary O
tasks O
quietly O
, O
quickly O
, O
and O
efficiently O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
and O
the O
screen O
is O
not O
as O
nice O
as O
a O
retina O
display O
ipad O
but O
it O
is O
just O
fine O
for O
everyday O
tasks O
. O

The O
rubber O
feet O
help O
it O
to O
not O
move O
around O
on O
a O
smooth O
surface O
and O
there O
are O
two O
rubber O
rings O
around O
the O
hinge O
axle O
that O
help O
your O
phone O
stay O
in O
place O
because O
it O
makes O
contact O
with O
the O
back O
. O

This O
attacts O
fingerprints O
like O
mad O
. O

Amazon O
deliver O
the O
computer O
very O
fast O
and O
well O
package O
. O

but O
I O
use O
it O
everyday O
and O
thus O
far O
no O
signs O
of O
wear O
. O

I O
have O
therefore O
dropped O
the O
rating O
from O
5 O
stars O
to O
1 O
star O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
as O
it O
is O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
manufacturer O
's O
supplied O
gear O
. O

Controls O
on O

are O
simple O

, O
Bluetooth O

, O

and O
volume O
. O

Chromebook O
is O
more O
revolutionary O
than O
the O
first O
Apple O
or O
the O
Windows O
OS O
. O

I O
used O
it O
maybe O
thrice O
( O
3 O
) O
and O
my O
battery O
died O
quick O
. O

Pretty O
quick O
charge O
and O
advertised O
battery O
life O
! O

so O
good O
thing O

I O
plugged O
the O
charger O
back O
in O
, O
thinking O
that O
it O
is O
only O
the O
first O
time O
, O
and O
the O
same O
thing O
displayed O
. O

I O
think O
this O
will O
work O
very O
good O
for O
anyone O
wanting O
that O
extra O
space O
. O

Was O
n't O
sure O
about O
it O
at O
first O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
options O
. O

MacBook O
Pro O
as O
well O
as O

It O
works O
like O
it O
should O
. O

For O
the O
price O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
anything O
can O
touch O
it O
. O

Bottomline O
, O
excellent O
product O
and O
a O
versatile O
bag O
to O
add O
to O
your O
collection O
. O

I O
will O
be O
returning O
this O
product O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
replacement O
adapter O
, O
since O
the O
original O
one O
quit O
on O
me O
and O

Ill O
tire O
of O

and O
they O
're O
all O
going O
to O
buy O
more O

This O
fits O
the O

perfectly O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
cross O
between O
a O
huge O
iPad O
and O
a O
small O
laptop.---Kelvington O

I O
bought O
this O
battery O
because O
another O
brand O
that O
I O
purchased O
less O
than O
a O
year O
ago O
had O
already O
failed O

If O
it O
had O
an O

it O
would O
be O
a O
no O

brainer O
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
. O

i O
actually O
bought O
two O
of O
them O
. O

but O
just O
a O
click O

the O

do O

count O
on O
anything O

from O

If O
you O
do O
plan O
on O
upping O
the O

in O
this O

, O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
'd O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
up O
the O

too O
to O

I O
read O
mixed O
reviews O

so O
I O
rolled O
the O
dice O
and O
bought O
these O

My O

also O
uses O
it O
when O
I O
do O

it O

I O
actually O
thought O
they O
forgot O
to O
ship O
this O

at O

I O
use O
it O

Some O
people O
might O
like O
the O
blue O
glowing O
but O
honestly O
since O
your O
laptop O
sits O
on O
it O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
it O
anyways O
. O

I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
a O
top O
- O
loader O
as O
that O
reduces O
the O
potential O
for O
the O
computer O
to O
come O
tumbling O
out O
if O
you O
open O
a O
zipper O
( O
the O
case O
, O
not O
your O
pants O
) O
too O
far O
at O
the O
TSA O
line O
. O

If O
the O
interest O
is O
in O
trying O
GD O
filters O
the O
Goja O
filters O
are O
more O
then O
affordable O
and O
do O
a O
very O
nice O
job O
. O

It O
responds O
to O
1-finger O
, O
2-finger O
, O
and O
3-finger O
commands O
( O
which O
is O
very O
neat O
) O
, O
but O
it O
interprets O
a O
" O
swipe O
" O
as O
a O
" O
tap O
" O
quite O
frequently O
. O

For O
those O
keeping O
tabs O
on O
the O
hardware O
, O
my O
unit O
has O
the O
Elan O
touchpad O
, O
the O
SanDisk O
U100 O
256 O

, O
and O
the O
Atheros O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
HP O

Out O
of O
the O

when O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
and O
clicked O
on O

a O

popped O

But O
E12 O
sounds O
superbly O
. O

These O
cases O
run O
big O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
they O
had O
a O
stronger O
shell O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O

for O
an O

I O
read O
some O
reviews O
saying O
the O
connection O
is O
loose O
... O
etc O
. O

The O
only O
" O
problem O
" O
, O
and O
not O
much O
of O
one O
really O
, O
is O
that O
it O
does O
not O
fit O
very O
snug O
in O
the O
USB O
port O
. O

only O
complaint O
is O
price O
and O
it O
could O
be O
louder O
... O

Where O
else O
do O
you O
need O
such O
security O
? O

I O
like O
the O
keyboard O
. O

Unhappily O
, O
it O
will O
only O
charge O
the O
battery O
on O
the O
supplied O
cable O
, O
which O
is O
very O
short O
. O

Great O
IPS O
screen O

11ac O
wireless O
router O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
weeks O
. O

It O
's O
not O
to O
the O
point O
of O
noisy O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
maybe O
because O
I O
got O
used O
to O
it O
or O
because O
of O
the O
new O
SSD O
or O
because O
of O
the O
new O
windows O
re O
- O
install O
. O

Incredibly O
convenient O
. O

I O
've O
realized O
that O
the O
reason O
that O
many O
people O
are O
addicted O
to O
surfing O
the O
web O
is O
that O
you O
have O
easy O
access O
to O
multiple O
sources O
of O
information O
on O
any O
topic O
. O

I O
do O
wish O
that O
it O
had O
a O
little O
pocket O
on O
the O
shoulder O
straps O
for O
my O
cell O
phone O
. O

NZXT O
unit O
was O
in O
rig O
but O
it O
's O
solid O
rigid O
quality O
bites O
skin O
so O
best O
at O
home O
. O

Why O
two O
stars O
? O

Awesome O
laptop O
for O
the O
price O
. O

but O
I O
imagine O
paralinx O
does O
a O
little O
better O
but O
for O
3x O
the O
price O
. O

My O
charger O
dead O
from O
dell O
how O
I O
found O
this O

Highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
case O
. O

About O
50 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
the O
drive O
could O
not O
be O
found O
or O
was O
off O
line O
. O

and O
I O
still O
recommend O
it O
. O

My O
ultrabook O
fits O
perfectly O
and O
tightly O
width O
- O
wise O
( O
shorter O
side O
) O
and O
there O
's O
about O
half O
an O
inch O
of O
extra O
space O
length O
- O
wise O

While O
my O
digital O
camera O
also O
does O
video O
, O
the O
Mino O
is O
smaller O
, O
lighter O
, O
and O
easier O
to O
pop O
out O
and O
start O
recording O
with O
. O

but O
I O
do O
nt O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
my O
other O
3 O
. O
5 O
drives O
not O
being O
held O
tight O
in O
my O
case O
like O
the O
floppy O
drive O
( O
yes O
I O
still O
own O
one O
) O
or O
the O
3 O
. O
5 O
inch O
media O
card O
reader O
. O

IMO O
this O
should O
not O
be O
advertised O
as O
an O
11 O
. O
6 O
case O
. O

But O
how O
is O
the O
sound O
quality O
? O

I O
can O
encrypt O
the O
entire O
drive O
and O
access O
it O
so O
fast O
that O
its O
like O
there O
is O
no O
change O
. O

does O
not O
work O
with O
Windows O
8 O
despite O
a O
comment O
advising O
it O
does O
; O
I O
called O
their O
Tech O
service O
and O
was O
told O
should O
have O
ordered O
model O
ending O
in O
NHA O

I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
tearing O
at O
all O
. O

When O
you O
go O
back O
into O
Ghost O
, O
you O
'll O
see O
the O
drive O
. O

so O
it O
was O
much O
slower O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
your O
actions O
and O
professionalism O
serve O
to O
elevate O
you O
and O

in O
multifold O
ways O

My O
Dell O
laptop O
, O
for O
still O
unserviceable O
reasons O
, O
will O
not O
upgrade O
to O
Vista O
SP2 O
. O

Upgraded O
to O
8 O
GB O
in O
order O
to O
run O
parallels O
and O
the O
RAM O
is O
good O
, O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
nearly O
2 O
years O
and O
have O
no O
regrets O
. O

There O
simply O
is O
no O
substitute O
for O
computing O
cubic O
inches O
, O
and O
the O
2 O
. O

This O
modern O
looking O
thing O
looks O
out O
of O
place O
in O
my O
garage O
but O
like O
me O
it O
works O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

By O
necessity O
, O
one O
of O
my O
speakers O
sits O
a O
bit O
farther O
from O
my O
desk O
than O
the O
other O
, O
and O
I O
had O
initially O
expected O
to O
be O
able O
to O
compensate O
for O
this O
through O
the O
L O
/ O
R O
balance O
. O

It O
has O
no O
apparent O
affect O
on O
screen O
clarity O
, O
and O
I O
would O
notice O
if O
it O
did O
. O

If O
you O
pop O
out O
the O
riser O
, O
there O
is O
a O
little O
slot O
that O
you O
can O
store O
the O
nano O
receiver O
in O
. O

The O
odor O
mentioned O
in O
other O
reviews O
is O
definitely O
noticeable O
, O
so O
if O
you O
're O
sensitive O
to O
such O
things O
, O
you O
should O
allow O
some O
extra O
time O
to O
wash O
it O
and O
let O
it O
dry O
before O
you O
plan O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Previous O
problems O
with O
incomplete O
file O
transfers O
went O
away O
and O
the O
signal O
strength O
was O
strong O
in O
every O
room O
of O
the O
house O
. O

Cons O
: O
small O
screen O
; O
super O
micro O
USB O
adapter O
; O
limited O
4 O
G O
coverage O
( O
but O
major O
cities O
I O
travel O
to O
are O
, O
so O
not O
so O
worried O
) O

No O
problems O
so O
far O
. O

I O
had O
a O
few O
questions O
and O
they O
answered O
each O
within O
a O
day O
. O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
it O
in O
months O
. O

No O
more O
word O
minimum O
. O

so O
it O
could O
be O
read O
by O
both O
platforms O
. O

Depending O
on O
how O
sensitive O
your O
hearing O
or O
how O
much O
superior O
quality O
you O
need O
your O
sound O
to O
be O
, O
this O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
a O
deciding O
factor O
. O

One O
could O
not O
be O
recognized O
on O
my O
mac O
till O
I O
reformatted O
it O
on O
a O
linux O
box O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
very O
thick O
laptop O
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
bag O
for O
you O
. O

I O
work O
in O
a O
crowded O
office O
where O
this O
is O
the O
normal O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

The O
hard O
drive O
is O
oddly O
partitioned O
into O
a O
c O
: O
drive O
with O
about O
100 O
GB O
and O
a O
d O
: O
drive O
with O
about O
125 O
GB O
. O

It O
does O
work O
, O
You O
just O
have O
to O
get O
past O
all O
the O
ad O
's O
. O

and O
it O
looks O
like O
new O
again O
. O

It O
stands O
up O
to O
what O
I O
expect O
when O
I O
buy O
the O
Logitech O
brand O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
in O
the O
LC O
speakers O
. O

Beware O
, O
This O
zip O
drive O
does O
not O
come O
blank O
. O

You O
'll O
have O
to O
download O
and O
reinstall O
your O
laptop O
's O
drivers O
( O
just O
look O
up O
the O
model O
at O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
website O
) O
which O
will O
take O
maybe O
an O
hour O
extra O
. O

I O
GIVE O
IT O
FIVE O
STARS O
( O
HAVE O
A O
BLESS O
DAY O
) O

Lots O
of O
pockets O
and O
compartments O
. O

On O
my O
2nd O
one O
in O
60 O
days O
. O

Despite O
the O
described O
issues O
, O
this O
is O
more O
than O
what O
I O
got O
in O
my O
previous O
attempt O
. O

So O
if O
you O
do O
load O
up O
your O
bag O
, O
handle O
it O
gently O
and O
always O
carry O
it O
with O
both O
straps O
. O

and O
it O
works O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
new O
6600mAh O
battery O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
an O
old O
Anker O
battery O
of O
the O
same O
size O
on O
an O
Inspiron O
1545 O
laptop O
. O

It O
also O
does O
n't O
have O
any O
firm O
structural O
frame O
to O
it O
. O

If O
you O
're O
going O
to O
go O
cheap O
, O
may O
as O
well O
try O
that O
one O
. O

The O
receiver O
can O
also O
store O
inside O
the O
mouse O
if O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
it O
plugged O
in O
. O

I O
know O
it O
will O
not O
matter O
to O
everyone O
. O

Now O
my O
lap O
is O
literally O

I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
problems O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tight O
neoprene O
, O
not O
particularly O
thick O
but O
not O
uselessly O
thin O
either O
. O

It O
did O
teach O
me O
to O
not O
buy O
SimpleTech O
products O
. O

plug O
your O
laptop O
into O
an O
& O
# O
34;OLDSCHOOL O

; O

I O
tested O
it O
and O
even O
with O
hours O
of O
heavy O
use O
from O
morning O
to O
night O
, O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
it O
still O
had O
like O
30 O
% O
left O
. O

Kuzy O
really O
is O
the O
best O
brand O
for O
macbook O
covers O
for O
the O
price O
. O

It O
's O
done O
a O
great O
job O
so O
far O
. O

I O
was O
impressed O
as O
it O
did O
better O
than O
all O
the O
laptops O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

This O
is O
an O
all O
- O
plastic O
construction O
enclosure O
and O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
how O
well O
those O
slots O
will O
hold O
up O
over O
continuous O
use O
from O
taking O
it O
apart O
or O
if O
dropped O
. O

now O
my O
netbook O
has O
two O
nano O
usbs O
in O
the O
3 O
available O
usb O
ports O
, O

I O
really O
like O
the O
mouse O
and O
will O
probably O
take O
a O
chance O
on O
another O
one O
. O

Connect O
speed O
65mbps O
. O

The O
laptop O
said O
it O
does O
not O
recognize O
it O
, O
please O
insert O
an O
approved O
90 O
watt O
adapter O
. O

Windows O
7 O
is O
such O
a O
huge O
improvement O
to O
Vista O
32bit O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
The O
sound O
of O
the O
speaker O
is O
crystal O
- O
like O
for O
those O
high O
- O
quality O
music O
files-- O
this O
speaker O
has O
a O
high O
definition O
for O
the O
sound O
so O
that O
you O
can O
distinguish O
music O
files O
with O
high O
quality O
from O
those O
with O
poor O
quality O
. O

Quite O
simply O
... O
it O
works O
. O

But O
the O
bag O
does O
everything O
that O
the O
sales O
description O
says O
it O
does O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
trade O
it O
out O
for O
an O
SSD O
or O
at O
least O
a O
7200RPM O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
any O
android O
user O

Only O

you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
breif O

bag O
to O
hold O
a O

but O
would O
have O
paid O
double O
of O
what O
I O
paid O

of O
the O
excellent O

sound O
from O
something O
so O
small O

I O
did O

My O
office O
computer O
is O
a O
Mac O
Pro O
with O
the O
23 O
" O
Cinema O
display O
, O
so O
now O
I O
can O
set O
up O
my O
laptop O
with O
the O
same O
screen O
resolution O
and O
apps O
take O
up O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
screen O
real O
estate O
as O
on O
the O
desktop O
, O
only O
the O
text O
is O
a O
bit O
smaller O
. O

Battery O
life O
really O
depends O
on O
the O
settings O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
generation O
of O
Chromebooks O
. O

From O
the O
beginning O
the O
laptop O
had O
trouble O
and O
after O
returning O
it O
to O
out O
- O
of O
- O
box O
state O
I O
did O
manage O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O
for O
the O
most O
part O
for O
approximately O
3 O
weeks O
before O
it O
returned O
to O
the O
screen O
freezing O
and O
on O
reboot O
you O
would O
just O
get O
a O
black O
screen O
. O

It O
just O
seems O
a O
little O
big O
and O
boxy O
for O
a O
4-way O
splitter O
. O

I O
had O
a O
full O
sized O
LG O
DVD O
drive O
that O
was O
absolutely O
reliable O
and O
based O
on O
that O

The O
HD O
is O
there O
and O
can O
be O
removed O
with O
one O
screw O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
multiple O
monitors O
at O
work O
and O
at O
home O
for O
about O
10 O
years O
. O

Too O
Long O
Did O

for O
the O

, O
does O
an O
adequate O
job O
, O
and O
if O
you O

on O

this O
is O
the O
one O
to O
buy O

Introduction O
to O
Also O

Zarathustra O
, O
known O
to O
many O
as O
the O
" O
Theme O
from O
2001 O
, O
A O

. O

I O
would O
totally O
recommend O
it O
. O

But O
so O
far O
they O
are O
staying O
on O
my O
lenses O

Record O
multiple O
episodes O
of O
a O
series O
and O
prioritizing O
recordings O
is O
fantastic O
. O

If O
you O
receive O
a O
call O
on O
a O
second O
phone O
while O
on O
the O
first O
, O
you O
will O
need O
to O
juggle O
by O
placing O
the O
first O
on O
hold O
to O
answer O
the O
second O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
the O
back O
flap O
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
pair O
of O
shoes O
or O
all O
those O
cords O
for O
your O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
keyboard O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Does O
handle O
DVDs O
, O
though.- O
Again O
, O
" O
beats O

is O
good O
for O

the O

The O

this O

from O

. O

The O
applications O
load O
fast O
and O
just O
seem O
more O
integrated O
than O
Office O
2007 O
. O

Seems O
a O
little O
surprising O
and O
disappointing O
considering O
the O
price O
and O
quality O
otherwise O
, O
so O
ca O
n't O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

Put O
the O
tablet O
up O
on O
its O
stand O
and O
type O
away O
. O

, O
well O
, O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
a O
ultra O
lightweight O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
transmitter O
for O
reasonable O
distances O
and O
where O
shifting O
it O
from O
one O
place O
to O
another O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
player O
for O
quality O
HiDef O
video O
and O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
features O
this O
is O
a O
great O
player O
. O

All O
these O
work O
great O
. O

The O
labeling O
system O
is O
a O
great O
bonus O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
2 O
charging O
ports O
are O
not O
data O
ports.*This O
hub O
can O
not O
charge O
an O
iPad O
and O
communicate O
with O
it O
at O
the O
same O
time.*If O
I O
looked O
into O
the O
description O
a O
little O
more O
closely O
I O
might O
have O
figured O
this O
out O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
obvious O
. O

well O
I O
like O
the O
rubberized O
feel O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
is O
when O
the O
security O
updates O
start O
, O
but O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

The O
software O
with O
the O
product O
was O
not O
so O
good O
. O

Amazon O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
offer O
a O
ay O
to O
post O
questions O
to O
others O
that O
have O
ordered O
products O
. O

These O
make O
the O
job O
of O
cleaning O
my O
glasses O
much O
easier O
. O

No O
longer O
do O
I O
get O
a O
hot O
lap O
from O
my O
computer O
resting O
on O
my O
legs O
. O

It O
's O
a O
trade O
off O
, O
but O
either O
is O
a O
good O
buy O
vs. O
the O
typical O
netbooks O
that O
are O
available O
with O
Win O
7 O
starter O
. O

The O
nice O
price O
did O
n't O
hurt O
either O
. O

Remember O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built O
- O
in O
CD O
or O
DVD O
drive O
. O

This O
model O
comes O
with O
two O
buttons O
to O
boot O
from O
. O

I O
purchased O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
only O
now O
using O
it O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
nt O
return O
it O
. O

It O
does O
seem O
a O
little O
bit O
lighter O
in O
weight O
, O
a O
bit O
. O

I O
decided O
on O
the O
latter O
after O
I O
realized O
almost O
all O
the O
neg O
. O

There O
's O
plenty O
of O
competition O
though O
( O
and O
alternative O
even O
within O
Logitech O
) O
, O
so O
think O
about O
how O
often O
you O
'll O
use O
it O
and O
what O
features O
are O
most O
desirable O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
price O
was O
not O
much O
more O
than O
many O
adapters O
and O
less O
than O
some O
expensive O
adaptors O
. O

I O
recommend O
to O
buy O
this O
flash O
drive O
and O
quality O
also O
good O
. O

Would O
definitively O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

This O
is O
my O
2nd O
computer O
build O
in O
5 O
years O
. O

The O
biggest O
selling O
point O
of O
Android O
tablets O
is O
its O
extreme O
portability O
and O
lower O
power O

battery O
life O
) O
and O

I O
bent O
the O
2 O
edges O
to O
make O
them O
closer O
to O
coplanar O
with O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
sheet O
metal O
the O
fan O
is O
attached O
to O
, O
otherwise O
the O
fan O
could O
touch O
the O
far O
side O
of O
the O
copper O
heat O
pipe O
assembly O
. O

For O
a O
gym O
bag O
, O
this O
backpack O
will O
prove O
way O
too O
big O
unless O
you O
are O
packing O
everything O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
. O

Great O
value O
. O

First O
impression O
out O
of O
the O
box O
it O
struck O
me O
as O
cheaply O
built O
and O
flimsy O
. O

This O
device O
would O
be O
a O
major O
necessity O
for O
a O
serious O
player O
spending O
hours O
on O
one O
or O
two O
major O
games O
. O

Bottom O
line O
: O

The O
Federal O
Government O
watching O
you O
around O
the O
clock O
, O
like O
it O
or O
not O
! O

Main O
thing O
is O
that O
she O
got O
something O
that O
she O
would O
never O
have O
bought O
for O
herself O

Now O
to O
the O
issue O
I O
had O
with O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
effect O
the O
performance O
any O
and O
since O
it O
faces O
the O
lap O
or O
desk O
, O
nobody O
will O
know O
but O
me O
. O

I O
updated O
the O
software O
because O
the O
Thunderbolt O
port O
is O
being O
used O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
StarTech O
and O
then O
to O
an O
external O
disk O
drive O
. O

So O
if O
you O
pick O
it O
up O
with O
your O
computer O
, O
you O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
pick O
it O
up O
by O
the O
edges O
and O
not O
the O
middle O
or O
you O
will O
stop O
the O
fan O
, O
stressing O
it O
. O

Liquid O
spilled O
? O

therefore O
I O
've O
bought O
another O
one O
as O
a O
backup O
for O
the O
current O
unit O
. O

So O
far O
as O
it O
has O
aired O
out O
, O
the O
smell O
has O
disappiated O
mostly O
. O

I O
was O
forever O
losing O
my O
lens O
caps O
until O
I O
got O
these O
. O

All O
the O
functionality O
I O
need O
in O
a O
non O
- O
gaming O
machine O
. O

And O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
the O
trackpad O
still O
works O
, O
so O
if O
the O
hands O
get O
sore O
, O
you O
can O
switch O
. O

The O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
Optia O
camera O
is O
Windows O
only O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
a O
2011 O
Macbook O
Pro O
15 O
" O
at O
work O
and O
have O
found O
it O
to O
be O
an O
effective O
solution O
for O
what O
I O
refer O
to O
as O
the O
' O
time O
to O
cook O
dinner O
' O
problem O
. O

A O
little O
large O
compared O
to O
others O
so O
may O
need O
mounting O
. O

In O
hopes O
that O
this O
will O
help O
someone O
else O
, O
here O
was O
my O
problem O
: O
The O
instructions O
for O

the O

run O

I O
had O
bought O
this O

for O
my O
14-inch O
Toshiba O

. O

Sent O
it O
back O

I O
was O
going O
crazy O
with O

Works O
great O

Instead O
, O
it O
is O
a O
generic O

. O

We O
like O
this O
case O
enough O
that O
we O
have O
purchased O
another O
one O
just O
like O
it O
, O
hoping O
it O
was O
just O
a O
fluke O
and O
the O
new O

will O
be O

The O
plastic O
used O
on O
the O
headphone O
is O
very O
cheap O
, O
and O
the O
worst O
part O
is O
the O
number O
of O
buttons O
on O
the O
headphone O
makes O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
navigate O
when O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
it O
on O
your O
head O
. O

I O
checked O
on O
Amazon O
and O
this O
one O
was O
identical O
, O
except O
for O
the O
cost O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
slip O
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
zippers O
feel O
solid O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
fits O
great O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
not O
at O
all O
powerful O
. O

Also O
this O
is O
very O
comfortable O
to O
wear O
and O
the O
color O
is O
very O
good O
looking O
. O

As O
for O
sound O
quality O
of O
course O
it O
's O
no O
Bose O

the O
icon O
for O
this O
program O
has O
been O
the O
same O
for O
years O
, O
and O
looks O
like O
a O
gradeschooler O
made O
it O
for O
Windows O
3 O
. O
0 O
. O

Okay O
, O
now O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
how O
I O
overcame O
these O
problems:1 O
. O

Take O
a O
look O
at O
some O
pictures O
to O
see O
what O
I O
'm O
talking O
about O
. O

( O
It O
can O
be O
rectified O
by O
using O
a O
USB O
cable O
extender O
. O

I O
like O
the O
side O
pouch O
for O
carrying O
smaller O
items O
such O
as O
a O
flash O
drive O
, O
which O
has O
a O
smaller O
pouch O
included O
inside O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
quite O
get O
the O
11 O
hrs O
some O
people O
are O
claiming O
, O
but O
I O
run O
with O
networking O
very O
active O
and O
the O
screen O
medium O
bright O
. O

but O
It O
did O
get O
really O
hot O
the O
longer O
you O
used O
it O
and O

Everything O
I O
said O
is O
true O
enough O
, O
but O
a O
dead O
dock O
sort O
of O
negates O
it O
all O
. O

and O
you O
then O
an O
open O
document O
appears O
, O
ready O
for O
typing O
. O

Does O
not O
support O
two O
antennas O
, O
and O
only O
works O
in O
g O
- O
speeds O
in O
linux O
. O

Being O
the O
tech O
savvy O
one O
in O
my O
household O
, O
its O
good O
to O
know O
they O
're O
out O
there O
, O
in O
case O
I O
ever O
need O
them O
! O

If O
your O
video O
shooting O
desires O
fit O
in O
with O
its O
limited O
functions O
, O
this O
camera O
might O
be O
useful O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
it O
is O
just O
an O
expensive O
, O
limited O
function O
toy O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
product O
does O
n't O
bring O
any O
instructions O
manual O
at O
all O
. O

If O
you O
change O
the O
composite O
input O
source O
you O
have O
to O
mess O
around O
with O
all O
the O
settings O
again O
. O

It O
works O
, O
its O
small O
, O
its O
convenient O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
do O
everything O
with O
your O
tablet O
then O
this O
will O
not O
disappoint O
. O

And O
the O
last O
warning O
, O
when O
you O
power O
the O
unit O
up O
it O
very O
normal O
for O
the O
bios O
screens O
to O
look O
ok O
but O
the O
opening O
windows O
screen O
to O
look O
completely O
messed O
up O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
panic O
! O

Arrived O
quickly O
and O
intact O
. O

Occasionally O
it O
starts O
rattling O
and O
a O
tap O
or O
two O
seems O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
it O
. O

The O
only O
other O
storage O
is O
a O
thin O
external O
pouch O
with O
a O
small O
velcro O
closure O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
they O
could O
of O
added O
in O
this O
space O
? O

The O
plus O
of O
the O
SSSD O
is O
that O
because O
you O
are O
n't O
spinning O
a O
disk O
you O
get O
better O
battery O
life O
( O
I O
have O
n't O
experiment O
with O
that O
, O
so O
no O
data O
) O
and O
also O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
mechanical O
damage O
to O
the O
disk O
.... O
vibration O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
battery O
in O
my O
mac O
laptop O
needed O
replacing O
. O

After O
installing O
the O
memory O
in O
my O
new O
laptop O
, O
I O
installed O
Windows O
8 O
Professional O
and O
started O
getting O
all O
sorts O
of O
OS O
crashes O
during O
the O
initial O
setup O
phase O
. O

The O
quality O
has O
been O
good O
enough O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
have O
had O
to O

; O
drives O
- O
take O
all O
those O
brackets O
out O
! O

No O
tiered O
system O
either O
that O
will O
double O
the O
carrying O
capacity O
by O
stowing O
rarely O
used O
lenses O
and O

at O
the O
bottom O
and O
a O
camera O
with O
main O
lens O
attached O
stowed O
on O
top O
. O

The O
price O
is O
also O
pretty O
great O
! O

The O
seller O
was O
great O
, O
product O
arrived O
quickly O
. O

if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
hear O
the O
answer O
to O
your O
question O
: O
Should O
I O
buy O
it O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
screen O
- O
sharing O
feature O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
comandeer O
another O
persons O
computer O
( O
if O
they O
have O
Leopard O
) O
and O
control O
what O
's O
on O
their O
screen O
or O
vis O
- O
versa O
. O

It O
works O
wonderfully O
with O
my O
Asus O
. O

It O
works O
great O
at O
an O
affordable O
rate O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
very O
heavy O
duty O
and O
appears O
well O
made O
. O

I O
mounted O
the O
old O
USB O
hub O
to O
the O
lid O
of O
my O
laptop O
and O
intended O
to O
do O
the O
same O
with O
the O
HooToo O
. O

Installed O
easily O
after O
reading O
first O
, O
and O
has O
work O
great O
. O

The O
other O
half O
keeps O
killing O
her O
external O
drives O
so O
this O
is O
a O
last O
chance O
effort O
to O
find O
one O
that O
she O
ca O
n't O
kill O
. O

The O
ActiveSync O
software O
raises O
HELL O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
freezing O
with O
such O
lovely O
consistency O
, O
you O
almost O
think O
that O

part O
of O

firstly O
because O
they O
do O

secondly O
because O
, O
as O
I O
said O
just O
now O
, O
they O
have O
indentations O
clearly O

them O
apart O
from O
the O

keys O
. O

and O
I O
hope O
this O
review O
was O
helpful O
! O

This O
one O
will O
not O
satisfy O
you O
if O
you O
want O
a O
small O
speaker O
for O
music O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
laptop O
that O
often O
but O
if O
charged O
and O
left O
for O
a O
week O
or O
three O
the O
battery O
needs O
to O
be O
charged O
again O
. O

I O
am O
still O
learning O
how O
to O
do O
things O
that O
were O
simple O
with O
Windows O
7 O
, O
and O
some O
features O
seem O
to O
have O
disappeared O
. O

This O
cord O
works O
very O
well O
to O
reduce O
the O
clutter O
and O
allow O
me O
to O
carry O
both O
the O
battery O
and O
the O
iPhone O
or O
iPad O
, O
even O
in O
my O
hand O
, O
when O
the O
need O
to O
charge O
my O
device O
becomes O
a O
necessity O
. O

I O
normally O
will O
buy O
Sandisk O
memory O
, O
but O
so O
far O
this O
is O
working O
without O
problems O
. O

I O
have O
to O
carry O
my O
wallet O
, O
eye O
glasses O
and O
phone O
in O
my O
pants O
pockets O
and O
if O
it O
looks O
like O
rain O
, O
no O
exterior O
pocket O
for O
an O
umbrella O
either O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
to O
say O
that O
Sony O
came O
through O
promptly O
and O
efficiently O
, O
and O
that O
I O
now O
have O
this O
laptop O
just O
the O
way O
I O
wanted O
it O
. O

It O
's O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

A O
great O
buy O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
my O
digital O
camera O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
great O
. O

On O
a O
speedtest O
I O
was O
able O
to O
achieve O
no O
better O
than O
0 O
. O

My O
joints O
and O
manual O
dexterity O
are O
not O
what O
they O
once O
were O
; O
I O
found O
there O
was O
less O
stress O
on O
my O
hands O
when O
I O
was O
able O
to O
touch O
the O
screen O
rather O
than O
using O
the O
track O
pad O
. O

This O
adapter O
came O
with O
it O
to O
connect O
one O
of O
the O
two O
monitors O
, O
that O
are O
DVI O
input O
only O
. O

The O
price O
is O
good O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
coupon O
. O

I O
loaded O
in O
the O
driver O
and O
plugged O
in O
the O
adapter O
into O
some O
machines O
using O
XP O
Pro O
and O
Vista O
Business O
OS O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
well O
every O
time O
. O

And O
it O
crashes O
, O
no O
way O
I O
can O
eject O
the O
disc O
unless O
I O
turn O
it O
off O
first O
. O

Forget O
any O
visions O
of O
running O
games O
. O

and O
I O
wanted O
something O
with O
a O
bit O
more O
focus O
on O
the O
browser O
. O

Was O
n't O
a O
problem O
though O
. O

The O
headband O
is O
also O
very O
uncomfortable O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
very O
large O
head O
, O
but O
the O
headband O
is O
way O
too O
tight O
when O
adjusted O
to O
the O
correct O
length O
. O

and O
it O
works O
( O
Netgear O
adapter O
not O
plugged O
in O
) O
. O

I O
think O
the O
handles O
minimize O
the O
risk O
of O
dropping O
, O
and O
make O
it O
easy O
to O
carry O
. O

and O
I O
've O
already O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
main O
USB O
cable O
. O

Even O
if O
a O
more O
tech O
savy O
person O
than O
me O
could O
get O
it O
working O
on O
the O
ACER O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
simple O
plug O
and O
play O
solution O
such O
as O
I O
have O
on O
my O
Compaq O
, O
or O
on O
on O
a O
newer O
PC O
using O
HDMI O
. O

So O
let O
me O
break O
down O
the O
different O
areas O
and O
my O
observations:1 O
) O

But O
I O
did O
n't O
when O
I O
thought O
about O
the O
hefty O
15 O
% O
restocking O
fee O
Amazon O
charges O
for O
opened O
computers O
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the O
velcro O
strap O
that O
holds O
the O
macbook O
air O
in O
place O
is O
useless O
and O
actually O
gets O
in O
the O
way O
. O

This O
item O
is O
as O
promised O
except O
for O
one O
critical O
item O
: O
The O
bluetooth O
and O
wifi O
do O
n't O
work O
together O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Light O
is O
bright O
and O
adjustable O
and O
works O
well O
for O
reading O
my O
Nook O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

You O
should O
not O
have O
to O
read O
fine O
print O
to O
find O
out O
that O
a O

has O
no O
engine O
. O

Great O

, O

, O
what O
more O
could O
you O
want O
. O

In O
ASUS O
world O
it O
sucks O
to O
be O
me O

The O
50 O
" O
TV O
was O
excellent O
in O
its O
day O
but O
it O
was O
old O
and O
had O
some O
issues O
. O

The O
base O
station O
allows O
you O
to O
share O
your O
iTunes O
collection O
among O
all O
the O
computers O
in O
your O
home O
assuming O
the O
computer O
with O
your O
main O

is O
turned O
on O
, O
your O
airport O
express O
is O
working O
properly O
, O
and O
iTunes O
is O
running O
on O
your O
two O
computers O

or O
more O
) O

it O
to O
withstand O
pressure O
applied O
on O
the O

. O

And O
here O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
these O
fan O
operated O
ones O
that O
were O
USB O
generated O
that O
would O
zap O
my O
battery O
power O
. O

, O
just O
need O
to O
hold O
it O
close O
to O
your O
mouth O
is O
all O
. O

DVD O
player O
is O
great O
too O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
the O
battery O
life O
since O
we O
leave O
it O
plugged O
into O
a O
USB O
wall O
wart O
. O

This O
hand O
held O
laptop O
has O
so O
many O
great O
features O
, O
such O
as O
a O
touch O
screen O
and O
a O
great O
wifi O
connection O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
practical O
this O
is O
as O
it O
does O
take O
a O
little O
more O
effort O
to O
grab O
the O
pen O
and O
move O
it O
to O
the O
tablet O
compared O
with O
grabbing O
a O
mouse O
and O
mousing O
. O

Replacement O
for O
a O
defective O
power O
supply O
. O

so O
I O
would O
nt O
be O
bored O
. O

This O
item O
is O
well O
made O
, O
has O
just O
enough O
pockets O
for O
everything O
( O
without O
overwhelming O
you O
with O
too O
many O
pockets O
) O
. O

Am O
zon O
gave O
me O
a O
full O
refund O
less O
the O
shipping O
but O
provided O
the O
lable O
... O

It O
's O
not O
the O
sharpest O
resolution O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O

It O
arrived O
swifty O
. O

These O
ram O
sticks O
will O
degrade O
the O
quality O
and O
speed O
of O
your O
computer O
and O
that O
s O
if O
it O
even O
works O
at O
all O
. O

I O
gave O
this O
product O
4 O
stars O
because O
the O
bouncing O
action O
and O
static O
at O
top O
loudness O
. O

The O
strap O
does O
support O
it O
, O
though O
it O
's O
a O
little O
flimsy O
. O

You O
have O
to O
know O
what O
you O
sacrifice O
with O
an O
Ultrabook O
. O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
amount O
of O
computer O
for O
the O
money O
. O

It O
's O
not O
quite O
surround O
sound O
, O
but O
the O
simulated O
surround O
sound O
is O
still O
impressive O
. O

Love O
the O
touch O
option O
. O

Love O
that O
function O
. O

This O
inexpensive O
cat5 O
cable O
has O
brought O
internet O
into O
my O
garage O
. O

and O
it O
lasted O
two O
years O
before O
my O
sisters O
screen O
would O
n't O
work O
( O
we O
are O
twins O
and O
got O
same O
one O
and O
same O
time O
) O
. O

So O
he O
gave O
me O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
case O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
doubt O
: O
bought O
the O
same O
model!!!It O
fits O
a O
14 O
" O
laptop O
perfectly O
, O
protects O
it O
very O
well O
. O

Now O
I O
do O
have O
a O
few O
issues O
for O
which O
I O
had O
to O
remove O
a O
star O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
I O
made O
this O
purchase O
. O

I O
believe O
it O
really O
is O
faster O
, O

It O
's O
now O
November O
, O
and O
the O
air O
in O
my O
house O
is O
drier O
, O
and O
my O
body O
gets O
a O
static O
charge O
. O

Wiresless O
works O
fine O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
well O
balanced O
, O
when O
walking O
it O
rests O
against O
your O
lower O
back O
. O

Purcahsed O
my O
battery O
from O
ATC O
LLC O
via O
Amazon O
. O

The O
player O
comes O
with O
a O
USB O
power O
cable O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
view O
documents O
and O
movies O
. O

Anyway O
, O
after O
you O
run O
the O
installer O
, O
it O
requires O
a O
restart O
. O

Hope O
this O
helps O
someone O
. O

, O
people O
thought O
I O
was O
using O
the O
base O
model O
13&#34 O
; O
instead O
of O
the O
rMBP O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
new O
chromebook O

I O
have O
a O
Toshiba O
A665 O
and O
ordered O
this O
product O
because O
it O
had O
the O
stated O
that O
it O
would O
work O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
OEM O
Power O
Adapter O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
item O
, O
sound O
like O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

I O
swear O
to O
my O
mother O
's O
life O
, O
that O
no O
longer O
will O
I O
do O
business O
with O
Amazon O
, O
after O
this O
past O
10 O
hell O
days O
. O

This O
was O
ordered O
at O
the O
exact O
same O
time O
and O
it O
just O
got O
delivered O
to O
me O
today O
. O

This O
adapter O
solved O
it O
. O

Samsung O
advertises O
7 O
. O
5 O
hours O
of O
continuos O
use O
. O

I O
actually O
bought O
several O
of O
them O
when O
a O
large O
red O
office O
supply O
chain O
liquidated O
them O
for O
25 O
bucks O
, O
just O
so O
I O
could O
charge O
the O
Xoom O
without O
the O
attrocious O
, O
ready O
to O
break O
charging O
plug O
. O

The O

beautifully O
and O
more O
importantly O
places O
the O
screen O
the O
way O
it O
was O
meant O

excellent O
computer O
for O
those O
who O
need O
something O
practical O
and O
economical O
, O
brings O
little O
memory O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
can O
not O
be O
required O
much O

WITH O
THE O
SIZE O
, O
ITS O
TOO O
SMALL O
( O
PERFECT O
FOR O
A O
10 O
YEARS O
OLD O
BOY O
) O

I O
pushed O
it O
in O
very O
hard O
, O
and O
barely O
got O
it O
work O
. O

Her O
parents O
and O
I O
looked O
at O
all O
the O
tablets O
currently O
available O
, O
and O
compared O
them O
and O
read O
the O
reviews O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
already O
have O
good O
speakers O
, O
these O
ones O
are O
great O
for O
portable O
, O
or O
even O
just O
as O
another O
room O
. O

the O
size O
of O
the O
mouse O
is O
slightly O
smaller O
than O
a O
normal O
mouse O
, O
but O
not O
so O
tiny O
as O
to O
cramp O
your O
hands O
. O

Included O
are O
several O
pre O
- O
installed O
software O
. O

What O
they O
were O
and O
whether O
I O
should O
have O
them O
, O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
my O
Flip O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
just O
as O
well O
as O
my O
old O
one O
did O
. O

Using O
the O
battery O
right O
now O
, O
running O
for O
over O
2 O
hours O
and O
still O
has O
50 O
% O
battery O
life O
.. O
could O
n't O
ask O
for O
more O
.. O

I O
uninstalled O
and O
updated O
drivers O

I O
'm O
a O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
go O
. O

I O
knew O
there O
was O
a O
difference O
from O
cable O
TV O
to O
HD O
cable O
, O
and O
to O
1080p O
but O
actually O
seeing O
it O
is O
such O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

Just O
for O
your O
reference O
, O
this O
machine O
uses O
the O
Broadcom O
driver O
. O

Screen O
is O
better O
, O
but O
still O
has O
backlight O
bleed O
... O

It O
was O
very O
cheap O
and O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
're O
thinking O
about O
buying O
it O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
with O
an O
HDD O
, O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
before O
you O
can O
start O
browsing.- O
WiDi O
connectivity O

I O
would O
have O
put O
a O
slot O
for O
the O
charging O
cable O
so O
I O
could O
keep O
it O
closed O
and O
still O
charge O
the O
tablet O
. O

I O
am O
using O
this O
device O
with O
a O

I O
would O
have O
said O
: O
hey O
this O
is O
a O
good O
camera O
for O
that O
money O

Other O
then O
that O
I O
've O
been O
very O
please O
to O
date O
with O
the O
Chromebook O

, O
it O
works O
great O
, O
and O
costs O
a O
lot O
less O
than O
from O

The O
player O
does O
come O
with O
some O
earphones O
that O
suck O
and O
a O
neck O
loop O
that O
is O
great O
if O
you O
run O
in O
the O
woods O
or O
at O
night O
where O
no O
one O
can O
see O
what O
an O
idiot O
you O
look O
like O
. O

She O
's O
on O
a O
driveless O
Netbook O
, O
so O
it O
took O
a O
little O
work O
to O
accomplish O
this O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
a O
neoprene O
sleeve O
style O
case O
for O
my O
laptop O
and O
I O
put O
that O
sleeve O
into O
the O
computer O
slot O
. O

But O
Hey O
! O
! O
are O
you O
willing O
to O
pay O
that O
much O
in O
this O
economy O
when O
you O
get O
same O
comparable O
product O
for O
674 O
$ O
, O
if O
your O
answer O
is O
NO O
and O
Read O
BelowPros O

I O
picked O
up O
one O
of O
these O
to O
use O
with O
my O
cables O
in O
my O
dorm O
, O
and O
it O
's O
done O
a O
decent O
job O
so O
far O
. O

Headphone O
Extension O
Cordso O

Let O
me O
say O
that O
I O
was O
happy O
when O
the O
item O
came O
because O
it O
looks O
nice O
and O
feels O
well O
built O
. O

Very O
good O
price O
on O
a O
style O
of O
cord O
commonly O
used O
in O
laptop O
charges O
and O
other O
chargers O
too O
. O

You O
pay O
more O
for O
the O
service O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
the O
box O
( O
cable O
companies O
" O
loan O
" O
you O
the O
box O
) O
, O
but O
they O
make O
sure O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
. O

Second O
, O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
look O
like O
' O
thief O
bate O
. O
' O

The O
other O
thing O
now O
happening O
is O
the O
scroll O
wheel O
is O
" O
jumping O
" O
up O
and O
down O
during O
scrolling O

Next O
hold O
the O
eject O
botton O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
TV O
, O
and O
turn O
the O
power O
on O
while O
still O
holding O
the O
eject O
button O
- O
keep O
holding O
it O
until O
it O
ejects O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
light O
weight O
laptop O
after O
lugging O
around O
a O
6 O
lb O
Toshiba O
for O
as O
many O
years O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
battery O
I O
've O
ordered O
for O
this O
laptop O
from O
Amazon O
in O
the O
past O
week O
. O

Bought O
the O
11 O
. O
6 O
inch O
size O
as O
a O
way O
of O
protecting O
my O
tablet O
while O
it O
's O
in O
my O
backpack O
. O

It O
usually O
takes O
me O
3 O
- O
4 O
tries O
to O
even O
send O
an O
email O
, O
there O
have O
been O
MANY O
times O
I O
have O
had O
to O
start O
over O
or O
redo O
whatever O
I O
am O
doing O
even O
more O
than O
3 O
- O
4 O
attempts O
. O

i O
got O
this O
for O
my O
core O
duo O
15 O
" O
macbook O
pro O
( O
not O
the O
newest O
one O
) O
and O
it O
fit O
perfectly O
and O
does O
a O
great O
job O
of O
blocking O
all O
the O
dings O
that O
can O
occur O
everyday O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
happy O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
fork O
out O
$ O
[ O
... O
] O
to O
Apple O
. O

the O
wire O
that O
splits O
into O
3 O
power O
connectors O
for O
hard O
drives O
was O
too O
short O
for O
the O
second O
group O
of O
hard O
drives O
. O

After O
a O
few O
weeks O
of O
use O
I O
ordered O
a O
second O
one O
from O
another O
seller O
on O
Amazon O
( O
cheaper O
- O
but O
the O
same O
Anker O
model O
) O
for O
my O
wife O
to O
take O
to O
meetings O
for O
use O
with O
her O
Kindle O
Fire O
HD O
( O
a O
really O
crappy O
Tablet O
low O
of O
features O
, O
but O
she O
like O
it O
) O
. O

Shop O
on O
to O
other O
products O
! O

I O
see O
two O
strong O
points O
. O

The O
static O
goes O
away O
when O
it O
's O
about O
1 O
foot O
away O
from O
the O
dongle O
, O
but O
still O
has O
the O
whine O
. O

Considered O
a O
wall O
mount O
, O
but O
the O
stand O
mount O
worked O
out O
fine O
and O
it O
swivels O
, O
even O
though O
the O
view O
is O
fine O
from O
large O
viewing O
angle O
. O

I O
use O
this O
at O
work O
on O
a O
public O
network O
... O

But O
at O
well O
under O
twenty O
bucks O
, O
it O
's O
not O
like O
I O
have O
anything O
to O
complain O
about O
. O

It O
sure O
puts O
the O
power O
to O
whatever O
you O
're O
charging O
that O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

It O
's O
not O
available O
here O
on O
Amazon O
, O
but O
any O
mouse O
that O
has O
the O
Micro O
Nano O
USB O
receiver O
will O
work O
with O
this O
netbook O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
does O
not O
fit O
well O
and O
is O
also O
of O
poor O
quality O
, O
but O
figured O
that O
would O
be O
the O
case O
when O
I O
bought O
it O
and O
did O
n't O
really O
want O
it O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

Between O
the O
3rd O
and O
4th O
pouch O
there O
is O
not O
a O
zipper O
but O
2 O
clips O
that O
hold O
that O
section O
together O
. O

The O
only O
charging O
method O
is O
the O
supplied O
wall O
wart O
( O
no O
USB O
charging).It O
has O
a O
minimal O
set O
of O
apps O
installed O
. O

It O
does O
not O
recognize O
PowerPoint O
, O
which O
is O
sort O
of O
the O
coin O
of O
the O
realm O
for O
business O
and O
educational O
presentations O
. O

Had O
the O
Turnstyle O
5 O
and O
that O
was O
just O
a O
little O
too O
small O
for O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
use O
of O
out O
this O
camera O
. O

I O
will O
say O
it O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
if O
the O
plug O
was O
a O
little O
differently O
positioned O

Did O
not O
feel O
cheap O
. O

2GHz O
Celeron O
900 O
will O
help O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
buy O
this O
one O
again O
. O

With O
that O
though O
, O
there O
is O
really O
no O
way O
to O
put O
much O
of O
anything O
else O
in O
the O
numerous O
pockets O
unless O
it O
's O
slim O
. O

Channel O
select O
up O
and O
down O
works O
but O
not O
entering O
a O
specific O
number O
. O

This O
is O
important O
for O
my O
background O
. O

RIGHT O
NOW O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
gotten O
the O
highest O
capacity O
Solid O
State O
Drive O
that O
they O
offer O
. O

This O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
think O
HP O
needs O
to O
be O
more O
careful O
which O
Chinese O
outsourced O
product O
they O
stick O
their O
decal O
on O
. O

they O
're O
not O
big O
enough O
for O
water O
bottles O
, O
not O
padded O
for O
camera O
equipment O
, O
and O
not O
secure O
enough O
for O
memory O
cards O
or O
batteries O
. O

Almost O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
avoid O
Amazon O
altogether O
. O

Not O
much O
else O
to O
say O
about O
it O
. O

I O
am O
ordering O
a O
second O
one O
so O
that O
I O
can O
set O
it O
up O
at O
my O
desk O
and O
have O
one O
that O
I O
unplug O
and O
one O
that O
stays O
plugged O
in O
. O

They O
definitely O
do O
n't O
work O
as O
well O
as O
the O
nice O
Bose O
headphones O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
then O
often O
enough O
to O
justify O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
Bose O
ones O
. O

I O
left O
my O
mac O
air O
at O
home O
and O
am O
writing O
this O
on O
the O
725 O
. O

To O

, O
go O

When O
it O
arrives O
, O
I O
'll O
update O
the O

Easily O
fits O
the O
largest O
of O
the O
17 O
" O
laptops O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
any O
Firewire O
devices O
so O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
Firewire O
port O
has O
never O
been O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
replace O
her O
6 O
year O
old O
laptop O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
hook O
up O
an O
older O
22 O
inch O
Digital O
monitor O
with O
no O
HDMI O
port O
. O

The O
plug O
fits O
loosely O
so O
it O
will O
only O
charge O
when O
its O
held O
at O
a O
certain O
angle O
. O

Who O
'd O
have O
thunk O
that O
Bill O
Gates O
would O
be O
bribing O
people O
to O
pan O
the O
new O
MacBook O
on O
Amazon O
? O

Lots O
of O
Toshibas O
, O
and O
I O
own O
a O
few O
Acers O
myself O
. O

but O
it O
seems O
to O
lack O
crispness O
. O

Upon O
arrival O
, O
I O
installed O
the O
software O
and O
then O
the O
card O
into O
the O
cardbus O
slot O
of O
my O
PC O
. O

The O
Bad:1- O
Terrible O
ergonomics O
, O
this O
is O
serious O
, O
they O
make O
the O
keyboard O
so O
small O
, O
and O
most O
actions O
require O
the O
touchpad O
, O
now O
I O
have O
to O
wear O
a O
splint O
for O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome O
. O

This O
keyboard O
is O
OKNot O
incredible O
, O
you O
do O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
forThe O

is O

and O
CLEARLY O

15 O
bucks O

Cheap O
little O
thing O
but O
works O
. O

The O
laptop O
pocket O
has O
a O
retaining O
strap O
. O

Sorry O
iHome O
, O
just O
telling O
it O
like O
it O
is O
. O

That O
being O
said O

I O
feel O
I O
got O
my O
moneys O
worth O
with O
the O

bag O
but O
not O
so O
with O
this O

I O
live O
in O
a O
townhouse O
so O
the O
router O
was O
upstairs O
therefore O
the O
signal O
needs O
to O
arrive O
to O
the O
HAWNU1 O
at O
an O
angle O
through O
several O
walls O
and O
the O
floor O
. O

did O
it O
look O
amazing O
, O

Did O
n't O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
because O
even O
though O
it O
fit O
my O
laptop O
, O
there O
is O
n't O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
room O
for O
anything O
but O
the O
computer O
in O
the O
other O
compartments O
once O
you O
load O
in O
your O
laptop O
. O

For O
a O
hard O
core O
gamer O
thou O
, O
this O
laptop O
would O
n't O
work O
. O

My O
I O
- O
Pad O
on O
its O
own O
just O
does O
n't O
have O
enough O
juice O
; O
I O
have O
to O
carry O
it O
around O
where O
ever O
I O
am O
because O
otherwise O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
hear O
it O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
figured O
out O
a O
suitable O
workaround O
for O
this O
. O

You O
might O
have O
to O
carry O
another O
bag O
if O
you O
carry O
more O
than O
2 O
books O
and O
a O
laptop O
but O
for O
most O
uses O
it O
's O
great O
! O

My O
first O
purchase O
of O
Mii O
Buttons O
and O
I O
love O
them O
. O

I O
contacted O
the O
company O
and O
was O
told O
to O
send O
it O
back O
for O
a O
full O
refund O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
stand O
does O
not O
fit O
my O

. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
, O
before O
I O
even O
got O
the O
machine O
the O
price O
went O
down O

I O
very O
rarely O
use O
it O
because O
there O
's O
always O
at O
least O
a O
some O
static O
. O

First O
thing O
you O
need O
before O
setting O
up O
this O
thing O
is O
a O
12 O

It O
's O
long O

thick O
enough O

sold O
at O
the O
Right O
low O
price O
. O

I O
unplugged O
the O
power O

and O
the O
laptop O
shut O
off O
. O

but O
it O
works O
great O
for O
me O
. O

it O
feels O
cheap O
too O
. O
not O
much O
to O
it O
. O

I O
live O
about O
25 O
miles O
from O
Philadelphia O
and O
i O
get O
all O
of O
the O
Philadelphia O

. O

None O
of O
them O
are O
perfect O
but O
if O
all O
is O
right O
with O
the O
world O
and O
your O
computer O
, O
this O
one O
is O
relatively O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
usually O
works O
well O
signal O
- O
wise O
, O
particularly O
with O
a O
booster O
on O
your O
router O
( O
bought O
the O
Linksys O
booster O
for O
their O
wireless O
router O
and O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
improvement O
with O
all O
of O
these O
devices).Take O
note O
of O
the O
installation O
procedures O
since O
each O
OS O
has O
different O
steps O
to O
follow O
. O

The O
mouse O
started O
flaking O
out O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

The O
curved O
straps O
have O
1 O
" O
thick O
padding O
down O
their O
length O
and O
are O
3 O
1/2 O
" O
wide O
for O
comfort O
. O

But O
if O
having O
your O
entire O
iTunes O
music O
catalog O
playable O
through O
most O
any O
stereo O
in O
your O
home O
, O
than O
this O
might O
be O
the O
one O
. O

Serious O
lack O
of O
customization O
. O

I O
planned O
to O
upgrade O
to O
2 O
GB O
and O
ordered O
the O
Crucial O
CT25664AC800 O
as O
was O
recommended O
in O
some O
reviews O
. O

I O
was O
particularly O
sold O
on O
the O
videos O
showing O
how O
it O
can O
handle O
abuse O
, O
and O

You O
do O
n't O
feel O
any O
heat O
from O
your O
laptop O
. O

It O
protects O
the O
netbook O
and O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
carry O
it O
around O
. O

The O
worst O
part O
is O
that O
the O
active O
stage O
's O
neighboring O
stages O
can O
be O
see O
at O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
screen O
( O
you O
can O
see O
that O
in O
the O
images O
in O

I O
'd O
previously O
read O
some O
horror O
stories O
about O
getting O

well O

sometimes O

or O
wander O
in O

You O
will O
only O
get O

weeks O
so O
far O
, O
and O
have O
been O
incredibly O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

I O
am O
really O
starting O
to O
think O
I O
should O
avoid O
all O
HP O
laptops O
all O
together O
. O

The O
computer O
fits O
just O
right O
with O
no O
slack O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
off O
a O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
who O
let O
me O
use O
this O
for O
a O
video O
player O
I O
had O
bought O
. O

At O
around O
$ O
34 O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
it O
's O
performance O
. O

and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
one O
that O
was O
n't O
expensive O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
others O
have O
had O
problems O
with O
the O
speakerphone O
. O

So O
the O
damage O
was O
already O
done O
. O

I O
used O
camera O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

However O
, O
I O
see O
dynamite O
comes O
in O
small O
packages O
. O

After O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
I O
had O
a O
working O
tablet O
on O
my O
Toshiba O
. O

Setup O
was O
extremely O
easy- O

Casting O
a O
browser O
window O
works O
okay O
, O
but O
you O
need O
a O
strong O
wifi O
connection O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
cover O
for O
my O
Macbook O
Air O
. O

So O
much O
so O
that O
the O
system O
reacts O
to O
the O
heat O
by O
slowing O
the O
CPU O
to O
a O
crawl O
so O
that O
the O
chip O
is O
n't O
ruined O
. O

This O
is O
sturdy O
too O
and O
perfect O
when O
you O
want O
something O
a O
little O
artsy O
with O
your O
kindle O
fire O

Nice O
little O
compact O
surge O
protector O
that O
gives O
me O
more O
assurance O
that O
my O
devices O
are O
protected O
from O
electrical O
surges O
. O

Stability O
is O
great O
, O
there O
are O
rubber O
pads O
that O
hold O
the O
computer O
and O
on O
the O
bottom O
to O
prevent O
slipping O
. O

Used O

I O
have O
had O
numerous O
people O
tell O
me O
how O
great O
my O
filter O
works O
. O

They O
shipped O
me O
a O
second O
battery O
, O
which O
fit O
slightly O
better O
( O
but O
not O
perfectly).I'm O
really O
impressed O
with O
Anker O
's O
support O
an O

I O
've O
mounted O
this O
on O
my O
motorcyle O
using O
a O
Ram O
Mount O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
mouse O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
. O

If O
lucky O
, O
they O
send O
a O
similiar O
but O
not O
same O
and O
possibly O
a O
lesser O
model O
. O

There O
's O
a O
little O
drawstring O
bag O
that O
holds O
everything O
- O
speaker O
, O
USB O
charging O
cable O
, O
audio O
cable O
( O
3 O
. O
5 O
mm O
) O
, O
and O
instructions O
. O

Quirky O
trackpad O
. O

When O
My O
laptop O
gets O
hot O
, O
I O
slip O
this O
pad O
out O
of O
my O
computer O
bag O
and O
it O
drops O
instantly O
. O

Agree O
with O
several O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
, O
great O
sound O
from O
some O
small O
cheap O
speakers O
. O

Changed O
my O
stars O
down O
to O
2 O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
driver O
issue O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
it O
did O
its O
job O
for O
when O
I O
needed O
it O
. O

The O
rub O
is O
the O
charger O
does O
n't O
decide O
how O
much O
electricity O
to O
send O
, O
but O
rather O
the O
device O
itself O
that O
PULLS O
electricity O
from O
the O
AC O
plug O
or O
USB O
port O
. O

It O
does O
have O
a O
Mini O
CD O
to O
install O
, O
so O
check O
your O
computer O
for O
compatibility O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
spendy O

My O
money O
probably O
would O
have O
been O
better O
spent O
on O
a O
keyboard O
case O
instead O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
install O
the O
software O
before O
inserting O
the O
adapter O
in O
the O
USB O
port O
. O

The O
output O
cord O
is O
thick O
. O

One O
less O
thing O
to O
carry O
around O
, O
and O
you O
can O
create O
a O
bootable O
card O
, O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
cool O
. O

The O
Arena O
headset O
is O
nicely O
made O
, O
though O
not O
as O
heavily O
over O
- O
engineered O
as O
the O
G35 O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

As O
far O
as O
how O
the O
computer O
works O
, O
its O
great O
. O

THE O
MINI O
SIDE O
TWISTED O

Even O
when O
their O
product O
failed O
they O
still O
stand O
behind O
their O
customer O
service O
! O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
it O
weights O
the O
same O
and O
has O
a O
much O
better O
protection O
of O
its O
Polysilicon O
screen O
- O
it O
does O
not O
bend O
and O
the O
Polysilicon O
screens O
are O
known O
to O
outlast O
the O
regular O
screens O
by O
many O
years O
. O

The O
fans O
are O
all O
open O
on O
the O
underside O
of O
the O
stand O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
same O
battery O
life O
of O
the O
original O
Dell O
battery O
, O
but O
lasts O
for O
3 O
- O
4 O
hrs O
and O
is O
lighter O
and O
more O
compact O
than O
the O
stock O
battery O
. O

The O
amber O
LED O
indicator O
is O
extremely O
bright O
. O

I O
take O
it O
every O
day O
to O
college O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
to O
take O
it O
on O
our O
driving O
vacation O
this O
summer O
. O

It O
really O
was O
a O
breeze O
to O
install O
; O
in O
fact O
it O
simply O
just O
slipped O
right O
in O
to O
the O
headrest O
very O
easily O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
Comast O
has O
newer O
DVR O
boxes O
that O
offer O
1080p O
or O
not O
. O

Sonically O
I O
think O
this O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
K550 O

A O
thief O
would O
have O
to O
do O
some O
serious O
damage O
to O
remove O
this O
thing O
or O
bring O
along O
some O
bolt O
cutters O
. O

For O
the O
price O
of O
less O
than O
$ O
900 O
get O
it O
if O
you O
want O
a O
machine O
that O
will O
last O
many O
years O
. O

A O
rare O
Ultrabook O
feature O
and O
Samsung O
wisely O
chose O
not O
to O
cram O
full O
HD O
1920 O
into O
only O
15 O
inches O
. O

The O
3D O
effect O
on O
it O
looks O
great O
and O
gives O
it O
a O
whole O
wow O
factor O
using O
cheap O
glasses O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
fortune O
for O
each O
pair O
. O

I O
believe O
It O
was O
just O
bad O
luck O
to O
get O
a O
defective O
unit O
. O

Just O
slide O
sideways O
lol O
, O
they O
were O
giving O
us O
fits O
but O
really O
so O
simple O
once O
you O
get O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
. O

so O
probably O
not O
going O
with O
these O
again O
. O

Easy O
to O
carry O
in O
a O
backpack O
or O
suitcase O
. O

The O
Linksys O
WRT54GX4 O
actually O
worked O
rather O
well O
for O
the O
first O
three O
months O

When O
this O
happens O
, O
one O
can O
not O
charge O
the O
netbook O
, O
and O
therefore O
can O
not O
use O
it O
until O
one O
obtains O
a O
new O
charger O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
crisp O
and O
there O
's O
a O
firm O
but O
not O
overpowering O
bass O
. O

Not O
a O
major O
flaw O
, O
but O
noticeable O
if O
you O
had O
the O
original O
Prime O
. O

Works O
fine O
. O

I O
tried O
charging O
them O
on O
my O
computer O
while O
listening O
to O
my O
MP3 O
player O
, O
but O
there O
is O
still O
the O
buzz O
. O

It O
does O
help O
with O
glare O
and O
for O
that O
reason O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
even O
with O
the O
bubbles O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
moved O
to O
messenger O
- O
style O
bags O
a O
while O
ago O
after O
finding O
backpacks O
uncomfortable O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
they O
did O
n't O
just O
bite O
the O
bullet O
and O
put O
a O
phone O
in O
as O
well O
, O
then O
you O
could O
toss O
the O
Palm O
/ O
Blackberry O
. O

I O
then O
bought O
the O
equivalent O
Patriot O
memory O
sticks O
that O
Amazon O
sells O
, O
they O
're O
working O
great O
. O

There O
are O
no O
dedicated O
card O
or O
filter O
holders O
on O
the O
bag O
, O
but O
these O
pockets O
work O
well O
enough O
. O

I O
got O
the O
750 O
version O
of O
this O
power O
supply O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
good O
PSU O
so O
far O
, O
all O
cords O
fit O
nicely O
and O
reach O
everywhere O
in O
a O
full O
size O
case O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
I O
am O
right O
- O
handed O
, O
but O
I O
can O
see O
a O
left O
- O
handed O
person O
being O
off O
put O
by O
the O
inability O
to O
change O
the O
location O
of O
the O
joystick O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
the O
screen O
on O
the O
Dell O
is O
much O
better O
, O
much O
easier O
on O
my O
eyes O
. O

These O
speakers O
are O
well O
built O
, O
using O
quality O
materials O
throughout O
, O
down O
to O
the O
heavy O
gauge O

anything O

less O

if O

It O
is O
just O
slightly O
over O
3 O
hours O
when O
I O
test O
it O
. O

Perfect O

looks O

You O

I O
'm O
using O
the O
dongles O
to O
connect O
blueray O
players O
to O
our O
wireless O
network O
to O
watch O
movies O
from O
Netflix O
and O
Amazon O
. O

Some O
people O
might O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
couple O
extra O
USB O
ports O
built O
in O
, O
but O
for O
me O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
use O
all O
the O
ones O
I O
have O
already O
anyhow O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
. O

It O
either O
works O
, O
or O
it O
does O
n't O
, O
right O
? O

I O
hope O
it O
continues O
to O
hold O
up O
. O

The O
recordings O
are O
clear O
, O
playback O
is O
easy O
, O
and O
I O
sync O
all O
my O
notes O
to O
my O
computer O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

They O
would O
not O
take O
the O
drive O
back O
, O
because O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
the O
bar O
code O
was O
ripped O
when O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
tear O
apart O
the O
impossible O
plastic O
packaging O
that O
SanDisk O
uses O
for O
this O
drive O
. O

But O
he O
agreed O
the O
issue O
was O
with O
the O
battery O
, O
and O
mentioned O
that O
often O
, O
if O
a O
battery O
is O
replaced O
with O
a O
functioning O
one O
, O
the O
case O
/ O
keyboard O
will O
just O
snap O
back O
into O
place O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O

The O
problem O
I O
have O
is O
that O
when O
the O
tablet O
is O
folded O
open O
( O
i. O
e. O
flush O
so O
the O
tablet O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
writing O
surface O
) O
, O
the O
function O
of O
the O
s O
- O
pen O
is O
hurt O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
free O
apps O
are O
available O
for O
the O
iLuv O
, O
but O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
bother O
as O
both O
apps O
are O
rated O
by O
users O
only O
2 O
- O
3 O
stars O
. O

So O
I O
suspect O
that O
the O
smell O
wo O
n't O
be O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
people O
. O

an O
open O
PCI O

HP O
, O
Dell O
, O

one O
, O
but O
I O
know O
MSI O
often O
does O
n't O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
hear O
anything O
about O
Asus O
. O

but O
I O
hope O
I O
never O
have O
to O
use O
that O
! O

99 O
a O
month O
for O
their O

I O
then O
moved O
the O
new O
folder O
somewhere O
convenient O
and O
opened O
to O
list O
the O

files O
. O

Altec O
Lansing O
have O
a O
brilliant O
series O
of O
speakers O
for O
Desktops O
and O

. O

The O
answer O
is O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
critical O
battery O
warning O
. O

Considering O
that O
this O
is O
usually O
happening O
when O
the O
only O
thing O
between O
the O
card O
and O
the O
access O
point O
is O
15 O
feet O
and O
one O
wall O
, O
I O
find O
this O
a O
bit O
dissapointing O
. O

99 O
and O
the O
other O
options O
on O
Amazon O
do O
n't O
really O
look O
legitimate O
and O
have O
absolutely O
terrible O
reviews O

so O
I O
opted O
for O
the O

However O
, O
I O
will O
say O
that O
when O
it O
sits O
on O
the O
table O
and O
I O
have O
the O
screen O
tilted O
back O
so O
that O
I O
can O
see O
it O
clearly O
, O
the O
laptop O
almost O
falls O
backwards O

Liked O
this O
very O
much O
the O
leather O
feels O
very O
soft O
and O
plyable O
and O
it O
fits O
the O

very O
nice O

This O
is O
actually O
understandable O
since O
making O
upgrades O
possible O
would O
require O
redesigning O
the O
entire O
computer O
and O
making O
it O
thicker O

heavier O

defeat O

I O
searched O
Google O
for O
this O

found O
from O
the O

that O
someone O
talked O
to O

received O
advice O
that O

be O
disabled O

Too O
stiff O

that O

this O

The O

it O

so O
I O

getting O

I O

like O
I O
have O
on O
a O
few O

lately O
that O
have O
great O
reviews O
and O
then O
are O
a O
little O
lackluster O
when O
I O
get O
them O
. O

It O
is O
not O
CAT5 O
or O
even O
CAT3 O
which O
requires O
twisted O

to O
prevent O
crosstalk O

shield O
from O

Dropped O
my O

pluged O
it O
into O
the O

with O
supplied O
mini O

( O
very O
short O

) O
. O

This O
model O
comes O
with O
a O
touch O
screen O
if O
you O
want O
it O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
opt O
for O
it O

i O
've O
never O
read O

found O
anything O
better O
than O

the O

sarting O

Only O
having O
one O

( O

I O
keep O
bundled O
and O
twist O
- O
tied O
to O
the O
shortest O
length O
possible O
) O
running O
between O
the O
two O
is O
totally O
unobtrusive O
and O
easy O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
thing O
but O
should O
n't O
happen O
. O

The O
padded O
shoulder O
straps O
and O
the O
part O
that O
lays O
against O
your O
back O
seems O
very O
well O
designed O
and O

but O
it O
was O
fun O
to O
play O
with O
. O

so O
that O
would O
probably O
explain O
the O
mix O
- O
up O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
the O
Innergie O
mCube O
Mini O
with O
several O
electronic O
devices O
over O
a O
period O
of O
months O
, O
and O
have O
had O
very O
limited O
success O
. O

Maybe O
other O
sources O
will O
be O
louder O
, O
but O
this O
is O
one O
use O
I O
definitely O
planned O
for O

I O
connected O
the O
computer O
and O
the O
TV O
. O

: O
Hold O
everything O
. O

a O
right O
- O
side O
USB O
port O
, O
or O
at O
least O
enough O
separation O
between O
the O
USB O
ports O
to O
not O
force O
you O
to O
use O
a O
short O
USB O
dongle O
cable O
with O
your O
3 O
G O
wireless O
card O

I O
put O
it O
in O
my O
garage O
instead O
. O

However O
, O
my O
other O
sleeve O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
either O
, O
and O
all O
pockets O
get O
saggy O
or O
can O
snag O
things O
on O
the O
way O
in O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
little O
product O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
from O
this O
seller O
again O
. O

To O
newbies O
, O
you O
might O
be O
concerned O
about O
" O
seeing O
" O
the O
product O
on O
the O
LCD O
or O
ipad2 O
screen O
in O
this O
case O
, O
but O
the O
bottomline O
is O
that O
when O
the O
unit O
is O
turned O
on O
, O
you O
will O
not O
notice O
theProduct O
being O
there O
. O

Performs O
as O
intended O
. O

This O
is O
a O
delightful O
device O
. O

I O
predict O
Dell O
is O
out O
of O
the O
tab O
market O
within O
a O
year O
from O
now O
, O
maybe O
sooner O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
seller O
and O
will O
buy O
from O
them O
again O
when O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

Although O
when O
the O
USB O
connector O
is O
retracted O
is O
not O
any O
more O
protected O
from O
thinks O
being O
inserted O
accidentally O
into O
the O
connect O
, O
like O
a O
cap O
does O
, O
but O
I O
have O
never O
had O
that O
problem O
. O

If O
you O
wanna O
take O
the O
risk O
, O
go O
for O
it O
! O

If O
you O
can O
get O
past O

the O

, O
most O
people O
do O
n't O
because O
they O
are O
located O
on O

i O
guess O
this O
is O
waste O
of O
money O

This O

critical O
for O

that O
may O
only O

one O

two O
full O

You O
may O
either O
find O
this O
cool O
or O
distracting O
, O
I O
write O
this O
so O
that O
you O
know O
when O
you O
purchase O
. O

This O
Asus O
should O
not O
be O
imagined O
as O
a O
home O
/ O
office O
device O
. O

Well O
designed O
, O
minimal O
materials O
, O
but O
strong O
, O
and O
perfect O
fit O
. O

This O
is O
a O
minor O
gripe O
and O
for O
a O
product O
of O
this O
nature O
that O
has O
been O
used O
tirelessly O
for O
3 O
months O
now O
I O
am O
very O
impressed O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
lose O
any O
sensitivity O
( O
okay O
, O
maybe O
a O
tiny O
tiny O
bit O
, O
but O
come O
one O
! O
) O

I O
chose O
the O
Mini O
311 O
because O
of O
the O
ION O
graphics O
. O

Setup O
was O
also O
more O
difficult O
than O
it O
needed O
to O
be O
, O
partly O
because O
of O
poorly O
written O
instructions O
. O

Inside O
the O
box O
was O
the O
Speaker O
, O
an O
instruction O
manual O
, O
a O
Mini O
USB O
charging O
cable O
and O
a O
Stereo O
Aux O
cable O
. O

My O
3 O
other O
portable O
speakers O
have O
a O
playback O
to O
charging O
ratio O
around O
6 O
to O
1 O
. O

it O
is O
sturdy O
and O
well O
build O
and O
feels O
like O
it O
will O
protect O
the O
Transformer O
well O
. O

Immediately O
connected O
with O
my O
Macbook O

with O

Excellent O
product O
, O
fast O
shipping O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Opened O
the O
box O
, O
and O
opps O
, O
it O
's O
almost O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
minus O
the O
internal O
padded O
pieces O
for O
cameras O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
other O
reviewers O
did O
not O
check O
which O
charger O
their O
computer O
needed O
, O
but O
if O
you O
see O
that O
your O
laptop O
takes O
this O
specific O
one O
then O
you O
are O
golden O
! O

Make O
sure O
that O
the O
following O
software O
is O
up O
to O
date O
to O
ensure O
that O
your O
port O
replicators O
works O
at O
it O

If O
you O
need O
this O
cable O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O
to O
buy O

once O
you O
've O

Cons:- O
Just O
one O
minor O
issue O

I O
can O
take O
it O
to O
class O
an O
not O
worry O
about O
outlets O
. O

She O
needed O
something O
small O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
not O
too O
expensive O
, O
and O
not O
a O
reduced O
funtionality O
pc O
. O

This O
is O
wonderful O
for O
security O
checks O
. O

It O
still O
may O
be O
used O
for O
toting O
the O
laptop O
around O
, O
but O
the O
size O
limit O
is O
disappointing.(T O
) O

This O
is O
my O
third O
purchase O
of O
this O
brand O
and O
so O
far O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
anything O
else O
! O

I O
'm O
not O
used O
to O
inserting O
the O
laptop O
into O
its O
compartment O
from O
the O
side O
( O
i O
like O
to O
put O
it O
into O
my O
back O
pack O
from O
the O
top O
) O
. O

Unless O
you O
sit O
directly O
opposite O
to O
a O
strong O
afternoon O
sun O
( O
where O
the O
Anti O
- O
glare O
will O
still O
be O
better O
than O
regular O
screens O
) O
, O
the O
screen O
will O
not O
reflect O
anything O
. O

I O
tried O
another O
unit O
where O
the O
kbd O
and O
mouse O
wire O
had O
to O
be O
swapped O
, O
and O
it O
stopped O
functioning O
in O
about O
two O
weeks O
. O

but O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
any O
degradation O
with O
this O
adaptor O
) O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
needs O
a O
simple O
computer O
. O

a O
great O
cheep O
way O
of O
adding O
3 O
more O
ports O
to O
my O
computer O
that O
only O
has O
2 O
Its O
been O
working O
for O
awhile O
now O
and O
even O
though O
it O
looks O
and O
feels O
cheap O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
! O

BTW O
the O
mac O
address O
is O
printed O
on O
the O
device O
in O
plain O
site O
. O

The O
keyboard O
backlight O
is O
a O
plus.[*]Speed O

Bottom O
line O
, O
if O
you O
can O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
DVD O
and O
VHS O
( O
and O
some O
people O
say O
they O
ca O
n't O
) O
, O
this O
display O
will O
drive O
you O
absolutely O
bonkers O
. O

I O
like O
the O
colour O
& O
pattern O
; O
not O
just O
plain O
old O
black O
but O
not O
overly O
splashy O
either O
. O

One O
can O
lay O
in O
bed O
and O
read O
and O
view O
videos O
comfortably O
. O

in O
case O
I O
needed O
technical O
help O
or O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
device O
. O

Initially O
it O
seemed O
to O
work O
ok O
. O

Experienced O
magnetic O
field O
issue O
... O
power O
button O
issue O
.. O
need O
to O
press O
the O
button O
multiple O
times O
to O
turn O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

A O
pleasing O
mix O
of O
silver O
aluminum O
and O
glossy O
blacks O
, O
professional O
and O
modern O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
plugs O
have O
a O
little O
" O
give O
" O
when O
pushed O
into O
the O
device O
, O
but O
they O
get O
the O
job O
done O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
effect O
the O
charging O
. O

when O
I O
wear O
it O
, O
the O
fit O
is O
just O
right O
( O
I O
'm O
6 O
' O
) O
. O

I O
need O
room O
, O
functionality O
, O
and O
protection O
from O
the O
elements O
. O

For O
a O
week O
or O
so O
before O
then O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
insulation O
of O
the O
house O
plug O
side O
of O
the O
cord O
had O
come O
loose O
on O
the O
transformer O
end O

So O
, O
I O
want O
to O
replace O
the O
PCIe O
wireless O
card O
... O

This O
is O
definitely O
for O
the O
USB O
hungry O
user O
or O
the O
person O
who O
never O
likes O
to O
plug O
and O
unplug O
these O
devices O
in O
, O
primarily O
because O
they O
can O
be O
tricky O
to O
get O
to O
. O

but O
once O
I O
saw O
the O
way O
it O
went O
together O
easily O
and O
has O
worked O
great O
ever O
since O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
it O
carry O
all O
the O
necessary O
notebook O
requirements O
( O
power O
cable O
, O
ethernet O
cable O
, O
files O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
, O
but O
everything O
else O
such O
as O
my O
wallet O
, O
phone O
, O
and O
sometimes O
a O
slim O
external O
hard O
drive O
. O

We O
have O
five O
iPads O
, O
two O
iPhones O
, O
three O
iPod O
Touches O
and O
two O
computers O
. O

does O
have O
Linux O
support O
, O
so O
I O
'll O
probably O
end O
up O
loading O
Ubuntu O
12 O
or O
maybe O
even O
Chrome O
on O
it O
as O
a O
second O
OS O
for O
netsurfing O
this O
weekend O
and O
calling O
it O
good O
. O

My O
Z400 O
has O
8 O
G O
RAM O
, O
cpu O
7i O
, O
1 O
T O
storage O
from O
the O
Lenovo O
website O
. O

When O
charged O
through O
USB O
, O
it O
takes O
more O
than O
8 O
hours O
to O
fully O
charge O
the O
battery O
! O
! O
! O

I O
think O
a O
grille O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
addition O
to O
the O
product O
. O

What O
else O
can O
i O
say O
? O

He O
exchanged O
the O
old O
for O
the O
New O
. O

Meet O
my O
expectations O
on O
my O
Nexus O

2013 O
. O

Great O
value O
for O
the O
price O
. O

My O
notes O
are O
more O
useful O
. O

and O
I O
am O
completely O
satisfied O
with O
it O
. O

The O
touch O
screen O
is O
responsive O
and O
this O
is O
actually O
the O
first O
laptop O
I O
've O
used O
that O
did O
n't O
make O
me O
want O
to O
disable O
the O
touchpad O
( O
my O
thumbs O
have O
a O
nasty O
habit O
of O
touching O
the O
touchpad O
and O
sending O
the O
cursor O
to O
screen O
parts O
unknown)!The O
price O
would O
give O
me O
pause O
, O
but O
then O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
anything O
in O
this O
price O
range O
that O
can O
meet O
the O
flexibility O
and O
power O
of O
this O
little O
mighty O
mite O
. O

She O
just O
says O
that O
she O
'll O
pack O
it O
in O
a O
bag O
( O

You O
should O
know O
some O
concept O
of O
capturing O
video O
and O
audio O
and O
what O
settings O
to O
use O
. O

It O
works O
ok O
if O
you O
want O
to O
put O
it O
into O
something O
else O

carry O
it O
around O

The O

which O
is O
extremely O

plugged O

. O

The O
1080p O
out O
put O
is O
REAL O

and O
it O
shows O
! O

It O
looks O
really O
sharp O
and O
offers O
good O
protection O
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
it O
was O
a O
perfect O
fit O
and O
except O
for O
lacking O
the O
Dell O
sticker O
on O
the O
bottom O
, O
looks O
just O
like O
the O
original O
. O

The O
memory O
is O
very O
fast O
. O

Especially O
since O
airlines O
seem O
to O
be O
cracking O
down O
on O
everything O
these O
days O
. O

It O
does O
indeed O
feel O
cheap O
and O
plastic O
, O
but O
that O
's O
just O
the O
miracle O
of O
low O

Be O
sure O
your O

One O
thing O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
have O
seen O
but O
is O
n't O
exactly O
a O
requirement O
is O
an O
easy O
way O
to O

I O
really O

more O
professional O
than O
my O

Sony O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
provide O
us O

it O
claims O

more O

from O

expect O
anything O

that O

must O
be O

this O

It O
does O
the O
job O
pretty O
well O
for O
daily O
trips O
to O
school O
and O
back O
. O

These O
headphones O
are O
very O
comfortable O
( O
a O
little O
tight O
maybe O
but O
that O
should O
pass O
with O
use O
) O
and O
have O
excellent O

I O
run O
a O

it O
runs O
my O

perfectly O
for O

which O
is O
what O
I O
do O
most O
often O
. O

This O
one O
fits O
my O
particular O
laptop O
perfectly O
and O
the O
handles O
were O
an O
added O
bonus O
! O

Both O
scenarios O
are O
still O
below O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
an O

this O
works O
great O
with O

I O
was O
very O

with O
the O

it O

you O

reaching O
for O
it O

Obviously O
, O
I O
picked O
the O

I O
find O
I O
can O
do O
most O
anything O
with O
this O

, O
that O
can O
be O
done O
with O
a O
much O
larger O
computer O

like O
a O

with O
the O

on O
the O

holding O
the O

in O
place O
snuggly O
. O

The O
reader O
is O
small O
, O
convenient O
, O
and O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
judge O
laptops O
on O
sound O
quality O
( O
not O
rich O
enough O
) O
, O
but O
do O
judge O
them O
on O
being O
able O
to O
hear O
in O
a O
loud O
environment O
, O
and O
these O
easily O
are O
the O
loudest O

I O
have O
ever O
heard O
. O

when O
tested O
with O

were O
great O

I O
hope O
the O
new O

lasts O
because O
I O
really O
enjoy O
using O
a O
premium O
headset O
with O
my O

. O

I O
did O
n't O
need O
more O
to O
use O

Moreover O
, O
even O
at O
128 O

the O
differences O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
sound O
is O
often O
as O
dramatic O
as O
night O
and O
day O
among O
some O
of O
these O
little O
overachievers.]Presently O
this O

Well O
, O
it O
was O
relatively O
painless O
to O
schedule O
-- O
and O
like O
other O
reviewers O
, O
the O
package O
moved O
much O
faster O
than O
originally O
predicted O
. O

That O
capability O
all O
depends O
on O
the O
type O
of O

you O
have O
in O
your O

so O
you O
will O
need O

not O

to O

I O

in O
October O
when O
she O
got O
her O

Installs O
easily O

Now O
that O
I O
see O
how O
great O
this O
works O
, O
I O
would O
pay O
double O
for O
this O

This O

When O
I O

there O
were O
several O

I O
could O

the O

the O

made O

if O

I O
think O
a O

of O
what O
we O
are O

are O
intentional O
changes O

and O
anyone O
who O
thinks O
it O

a O

is O
really O
feeling O
the O

of O
the O
changes O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O

how O

extra O
storage O
space O
. O

The O
Transformer O
fits O
snug O
. O

This O
proliferation O
of O
USB O
peripherals O
has O
also O
necessitated O
an O
ever O
increasing O
need O
for O
more O
and O
more O
of O
USB O
ports O
on O
your O
computer O
. O

Easy O
to O
apply O
, O
and O
helps O
to O
keep O
the O
screen O

free O
. O

- O
The O
case O
is O
not O
rigid O
enough O
for O
the O
lip O
around O
the O
keyboard O
to O
prevent O
the O
ipad O
screen O
from O
sliding O
a O
couple O
of O
millimeters O
left O
or O
right O
and O
falling O
onto O
the O
keyboard O
when O
closed O
. O

But O
for O
any O
meaningful O
work O
( O
and O
I O
normally O
need O
to O
coordinate O
between O
two O
or O
three O
programs O
) O

Speeds O
are O
great O
and O
streaming O
thru O
the O
Bluray O
player O
with O
Netflix O
, O
Youtube O
, O
etc O
. O
is O
really O
great O
. O

Right O
now O
I O
can O
put O
my O
laptop O
, O
charging O
cord O
, O
1 O
inch O
binder O
( O
full O
of O
papers O
) O
, O
a O
pen O
, O
a O
highlighter O
, O
my O
cell O
phone O
and O
a O
folder O
all O
in O
the O
bag O
with O
plenty O
more O
room O
for O
more O
things O
if O
needed O
. O

I O
also O
have O
a O
Microsoft O
LifeCam O
Studio O
for O
amateur O
stop O
motions O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
Logitech O
is O
far O
better O
webcam O
! O

- O
I O
want O
to O
add O
also O
that O
even O
though O
there O
is O
a O
" O
game O
mode O
" O
you O
only O
have O
to O
use O
it O
for O
480i O
sources O
. O

Blinking O
amber O
battery O
LED O
on O
laptop O
. O

Still O
does O
n't O
work O
with O
bionic O
. O

The O
shoulder O
strap O
comes O
in O
very O
handy O
to O
carry O
it O
around O
as O
well O
. O

( O
I O
had O
another O
one O
of O
a O
different O
type O
which O
was O
just O
as O
useless.)Buyer O
beware O
: O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
touchpad O
technology O
seems O
to O
be O
going O
downhill O
, O
but O
this O
seems O
like O
a O
good O
example O
. O

The O
extra O
feature O
of O
plugging O
it O
into O
the O
sound O
port O
is O
great O
for O
keeping O
track O
of O
it O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
for O
gaming O
, O
a O
bit O
heavy O
but O
still O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
if O
needed O
. O

19 O
minutes O
( O
starting O
@ O
100 O
% O
charge O
with O
no O
CD O
load O
) O
. O

It O
connected O
easily O
to O
my O
iPad O
and O
Android O
devices O
as O
well O
as O
my O
PC O
laptop O
and O
Chromebook O
. O

it O
was O
difficult O
to O
hold O
in O
my O
lap O
. O

Please O
let O
me O
know O
. O

And O
it O
's O
not O
like O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
if O
I O
unplug O
one O
enclosure O
and O
connect O
the O
other O
-- O
so O
both O
ports O
are O
alive O
, O
just O
not O
together O
-- O
so O
again O
, O
why O
make O
2 O
ports O
if O
you O
can O
only O
use O
them O
one O
at O
time O
. O

Was O
immediately O
recognized O
via O
Windows O
XP O
and O
working O
. O

has O
handled O
it O
quite O
nicely O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
computer O
only O
has O
VGA O
and O
DVI O
- O
D O
ports O
for O
the O
monitor O
. O

and O
after O
thoroughly O
cleaning O
it O
off O
my O
machine O
and O
then O
trying O
to O
load O
one O
of O
the O
much O
better O
freeware O
anti O
- O
virus O
programs O
I O
know O
works O
much O
much O
better O
( O
and O
costs O
nothing O
) O
- O
the O
program O
would O
n't O
install O
until O
I O
manually O
chose O
a O
specific O
folder O
( O
of O
5 O
choices O
) O
for O
where O
the O
usually O
automatic O
& O
# O
34;download O
manager&#34 O
; O
to O
download O
the O
program O
to O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
velcro O
strap O
that O
holds O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
case O
. O

It O
has O
a O
solid O
feel O
to O
it O
( O
moreso O
than O
the O
1005 O
) O
, O
but O
the O
battery O
juts O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
, O
the O
touchpad O
keys O
are O
terribly O
placed O
, O
the O
webcam O
is O
only O
0 O
. O

It O
does O
not O
seem O
like O
anything O
in O
my O
bag O
will O
fall O
out O
or O
there O
are O
no O
spaces O
in O
between O
when O
i O
close O
it O
. O

But O
in O
Lightroom O
it O
can O
be O
terribly O
slow O
rendering O
previews O
. O

I O
still O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O

now O
i O
can O
finally O
travel O
with O
my O
laptop O
and O
papers O
and O
pens O
..... O
good O
bag O
for O
a O
great O
price O
.. O

I O
mainly O
purchased O
this O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
motherboard O
as O
per O
a O
new O
system O
build O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
I O
guess O
its O
pretty O
good O
comparatively O
speaking O
to O
a O
factory O
new O
battery O
. O

It O
's O
great O
at O
multitasking O
. O

Not O
a O
real O
great O
feature O
like O
I O
was O
expecting O
. O

( O
Apple O
adapters O
- O
30 O
pin O
and O
lightning O
, O
not O
included O
) O

It O
was O
immediately O
recognized O
at O
the O
next O
start O
up O
) O
... O

They O
were O
set O
kind O
of O
loud O
and O
I O
turned O
them O
down O
via O
the O
( O
- O
) O
button O
on O
the O
device O
. O

You O
will O
see O
, O
the O
device O
and O
any O
Targus O
dock O
ever O
created O
is O
RIDDLED O
with O
software O
glitches O
and O
problems O
. O

I O
will O
update O
this O
if O
necessary O
. O

We O
use O
these O
at O
work O
and O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
any O
Mediabridge O
cables O
thus O
far O
. O

I O
would O
try O
to O
run O
the O
Bamboo O
Properties O
to O
try O
to O
fix O
things O
that O
way O

There O
is O
no O
volume O
on O
the O
unit O
itself O
- O
your O
digital O
music O
device O
volume O
control O
does O
that O
. O

I O
chose O
not O
to O
use O
the O
transfer O
but O
instead O
made O
a O
bootable O
usb O
disc O
to O
reload O
Win O
7 O
. O

and O
i O
will O
continue O
to O
buy O
these O
as O
i O
get O
more O
amps O
. O

It O
fits O
my O
Dell O
17&#34 O
; O
Laptop O
perfect O
. O

So O
far O
I O
have O
tried O
this O
with O
Waze O
and O
Google O
Maps O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
charm O
, O
cheap O
and O
reliable O
. O

and O
I O
have O
nt O
have O
any O
issue O
with O
it O

It O
is O
great O
for O
large O
items O
and O
will O
give O
them O
plenty O
of O
protection O
but O
its O
size O
prevents O
it O
from O
being O
as O
convenient O
as O
I O
would O
like O
for O
my O
smaller O
sized O
car O
. O

Perhaps O
more O
marketing O
than O
substance O
. O

so O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
her O
to O
use O
with O
her O
phone O
. O

They O
have O
a O
protection O
package O
for O
computers O
too O

is O
because O
the O
unit O
works O
and O
is O
not O
DOA O
. O

The O
straps O
that O
are O
provided O
for O
tripods O
have O
no O
snap O
buckles O
... O
you O
would O
have O
to O
slide O
the O
tripod O
down O
through O
the O
looped O
straps O
to O
get O
it O
in O
there O
. O

it O
connects O
to O
my O
Thinkpad O
X230 O
even O
the O
product O
description O
does O
n't O
say O
it O
is O
compatible O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
representative O
with O
very O
undesirable O
people O
skills O
. O

There O
is O
no O
screen O
adjusting O
either O
, O
no O
need O
to O
move O
the O
screen O
the O
left O
or O
right O
, O
up O
or O
down O
, O
it O
will O
automatically O
do O
it O
, O
and O
do O
it O
perfectly O
. O

The O
OEM O
6 O
cell O
would O
only O
hold O
a O
charge O
for O
30 O
minutes O
after O
3 O
years O
so O
we O
replaced O
with O
htis O
one O
. O

Does O
not O
work O
unless O
you O
bend O
the O
wire O
in O
an O
exact O
position O
and O
hold O
it O
there O
. O

The O
shoulder O
straps O
are O
well O
- O
padded O
and O
have O
mesh O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
charger O
with O
this O
voltage O
( O
in O
and O
out O
) O
then O
this O
is O
for O
you O
. O

The O

may O
have O
a O
little O
better O
shadow O
detail O
but O
it O
's O
not O
nearly O
as O
bright O
as O
this O
one O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
I O
'm O
speaking O
as O
a O

Pro O
user O
who O
refuses O
to O
switch O
Windows O

's O
until O
forced O
. O

Since O
we O
've O
only O
had O
the O

for O
about O
a O
week O
, O
I O
can O
not O
fully O
rate O
the O
batery O
life O
. O

Update O
: O
It O
has O
been O
approximately O
4 O
months O
and O
this O
cable O
is O
still O
working O
great O
. O

The O
other O
reviews O
seem O
to O
detail O
many O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
great O
purchase O
, O
and O
great O
case O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
this O
still O
will O
not O
rock O
the O
house O
but O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
average O
competition O
. O

It O
's O
very O
slim O
but O
has O
enough O
padding O
to O
protect O
your O
oversized O
laptop O
- O
i O
use O
it O
with O
my O
18&#34 O
; O
- O
fits O
snugly O
in O
there O
. O

Do O
n't O
smash O
them O
against O
a O
wall O
if O
youstill O
want O
to O
use O
them O
. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
replacement O
indeed O
. O

The O
big O
improvements O
over O
the O
past O
versions O
are O
, O
the O
speedier O
processor O
, O
Leopard O
, O
better O
graphics O

and O
faster O

. O

The O
blue O

logo O
is O
on O
my O
screen O
for O
about O
5 O
minutes O
after O
I O
click O
it O

However O
, O
it O
's O
enough O
real O
estate O
to O
see O
any O
document O
or O
website O
and O
yet O
be O
comfortable O
to O
read O
. O

The O
unit O
appears O
quite O
durable O
and O
performs O
just O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
often O
find O
myself O
cursing O
at O
the O
power O
strip O
beside O
my O
bed O
for O
not O
having O
enough O
outlets O
- O
with O
an O
iPhone O
charger O
, O
bluetooth O
headphones O
charger O
, O
portable O
battery O
pack O
charger O
and O
various O
others O
plugged O
in O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
space O
for O
a O
lamp O
and O
alarm O
clock O
is O
a O
hassle O
! O

You O
can O
put O
it O
anywhere O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
risk O
materials O
falling O
out O
. O

I O
got O
this O
piece O
of O
clear O
, O
thin O
plastic O
in O
a O
flimsy O
, O
open O
box O
. O

As O
i O
published O
on O
the O
AA O
verison O
: O
Keeps O
batteries O
really O
secure O
. O

If O
that O
ever O
changes O
, O
I O
promise O
to O
report O
. O

I O
do O
wish O
there O
was O
a O
pan O

This O
utit O
is O
fairly O
bulky O
( O
thick O
) O
. O

AA O
batteries O
, O
thus O
REALLY O
long O
life- O

It O
works O
well O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
thing O
, O
but O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
do O
with O
a O
new O
computer O
is O
fire O
up O
IE O
to O
download O
something O
else O
to O
use O
instead O
. O

When O
I O
opened O
it O
, O
and O
booted O
up O
, O
I O
had O
2 O
Asus O
updates O
ready O
for O
me O
. O

A O
great O
hub O
at O
a O
great O
price- O

The O
picture O
is O
very O
sharp O
and O
you O
do O
have O
more O
rez O
choices O
than O
advertised O
too O
. O

Bluetooth O
is O
becoming O
as O
common O
cell O
phones O
. O

For O
one O
, O
it O
's O
easier O
- O
just O
one O
connection O
and O
secondly O
, O
it O
enables O
more O
automation O
for O
automatically O
handling O
different O
source O
signals O
. O

But O
what O
they O
do O
n't O
mention O
in O
the O
product O
details O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
9 O
. O
99 O
a O
month O
fee O
for O
use O
of O
this O
product O
after O
the O
first O
year O
and O
you O
only O
get O
6 O
scheduled O
maintenance O
of O
your O
system O
in O
that O
year O
, O
not O
monthly O
like O
it O
would O
have O
you O
to O
believe O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
description O
. O

Small O
enough O
to O
fit O
into O
small O
areas O
and O
not O
loose O
much O
space O
around O
your O
computer O
. O

I O
am O
a O
huge O
sports O
fan O
and O
i O
can O
not O
believe O
the O
clarity O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

its O
never O
crashed O
on O
me O
once O
and O
only O
froze O
twice O
on O
me O
but O
its O
not O
happend O
recently O
and O
it O
does O
great O
at O
running O
windows O

but O
do O
nt O
get O

will O
cause O
your O

no O
reason O

One O
of O
the O
most O
important O
things O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
when O
ordering O
cables O
is O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
cables O
suit O
your O
needs O
and O
fit O
the O
job O
required O
. O

The O
rubber O
grip O
footing O
is O
solid O
, O
grippy O
and O
pretty O
thick O
and O
most O
of O
all O
it O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
solution O
for O
freeing O
up O
desk O
space O
. O

Now O
to O
the O
insides O
of O
the O

off O
the O

are O
normal O

is O
nice O

not O
too O
small O

some O
feedback O
when O
you O

Pros:-Pairs O
easily O
to O
every O
device O
I O
have O
tried O
- O
Battery O
life O
is O
very O
good O
, O
they O
have O
n't O
died O
yet O

She O
actually O
uses O
it O
most O
of O
the O
time O
as O
a O
desktop O
connected O
to O
a O
big O
monitor O
with O
a O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
. O

It O
's O
as O
handsome O
a O
laptop O
as O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
! O

I O
can O
see O
so O
many O
columns O
that O
I O
rarely O
have O
to O
side O
- O
scroll O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
'm O
just O
old O
school O
that O
way O
. O

Do O
n't O
even O
think O
of O
using O
the O
setup O
CD O
trying O
to O
install O
the O
device O
much O
like O
the O
way O

If O
you O
search O
for O
Targus O
and O
gigabit O
not O
working O
you O
will O
find O
a O
long O
thread O
on O
the O
displaylink O
forum O
where O
many O
users O
are O
complaining O
about O
the O
same O
issue O
with O
this O
device O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
get O
started O
and O
use O
. O

It O
is O
very O
lightweight O
though O
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
that O
hard O
to O
just O
carry O
separately O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
manufacturer O
for O
a O
replacement O
and O
they O
refused O
, O
unless O
I O
could O
provide O
proof O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

God O
knows O
how O
many O
millions O
of O
dollars O
were O
lost O
by O
computer O
manufacturers O
in O
sales O
account O
of O
this O
or O
gained O
through O
component O
add O
- O
ons O
to O
enhance O
the O
sound O
. O

Let O
me O
qualify O
that O
: O
if O
you O
own O
or O
owned O
one O
of O
the O
older O
model O
, O
with O
the O
folding O
" O
leg O
" O
or O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
call O
it O
at O
the O
top O
, O
then O
the O
new O
design O
is O
an O
improvement O
. O

My O
fault O
, O
but O
it O
should O
be O
more O
durable O
than O
that O
. O

i O
got O
both O
yes O

The O
Intel O
machines O
are O
the O
future O
of O
Apple O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
question O
this O
is O
a O
good O
machine O
, O
and O
it O
is O
powerful O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
good O
computer O
, O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

For O
the O
price O
and O
the O
size O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
. O

The O
InfoLink O
needs O
more O
features O
. O

I O
also O
have O
used O
this O
for O
less O
- O
graphic O
intensive O
games O
such O
as O
Portal O
. O

I O
know O
after O
about O
three O
years O
I O
will O
a O
new O
one O
, O
it O
saves O
stuff O

Nothing O
on O
Windows O
clues O
you O
in O
to O
that O
fact O
. O

This O
Dell O
has O
a O
4 O
and O
1/2 O
inch O
track O
pad O
and O
using O
multi O
gestures O
features O
makes O
it O
extremely O
easy O
. O

Batteries O
last O
forever O
. O

Was O
cheaper O
than O
the O
advertised O
plug O
for O
the O
fire O
and O
it O
works O
just O
as O
well O
. O

But O
once O
again O
... O
a O
similar O
problem O
. O

Heats O
up O
pretty O
quickly O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
felt O
it O
might O
just O
catch O
fire O
. O

The O
plastic O
seems O
durable O
and O
it O
has O
some O
heft O
to O
it O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
Chill O
Mat O
- O
as O
long O
as O
you O
install O
eight O
of O
these O
Velcro O
fasteners O
to O
hold O
the O
Chill O
Mat O
and O
the O
laptop O
computer O
together O
. O

This O
is O
just O
so O
I O
can O
browse O
the O
web O
, O
Facebook O
, O
Twitter O
, O
and O
read O
some O
email O
from O
the O
couch O
. O

I O
now O
own O
10 O
of O
them O
, O
and O
all O
of O
them O
work O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

And O
, O
there O
are O
great O
open O
source O
( O
free O
) O
applications O
you O
can O
get O
for O
Mac O
OS O
X O
now O
. O

The O
keyboard O
it O
's O
self O
is O
pretty O
light O
, O
and O
does O
not O
add O
much O
noticeable O
weight O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
still O
hot O

Use O
it O
for O
my O
bus O
& O
train O
commute O
every O
day O
. O

This O
hard O
drive O
enclosure O
is O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O
any O
of O
the O
PS3 O
hard O
drives O
( O
80 O
GB O
, O
in O
my O
case O
) O
, O
and O
requires O
nothing O
extra O
to O
work O
with O
any O
PC O
as O
a O
back O
- O
up O
. O

The O
charge O
is O
as O
big O
as O
any O
DELL O
or O
HP O
laptop O
chargers O
. O

It O
's O
not O
hard O
to O
do O
if O
you O
have O
something O
that O
cuts O
plastic O
( O
I O
used O
a O
Dremel O
) O
. O

These O
speakers O
sound O
very O
clean O
, O
and O
work O
very O
well O
together O
. O

still O
some O
for O
functionality.*Two O
out O
of O
the O
ten O
hubs O
were O
a O
little O
tricky O
with O
some O
of O
my O
USB O
devices O
, O
but O
I O
found O
out O
that O
if O
I O
moved O
it O
to O
another O
hub O
or O
jiggled O
it O
a O
bit O
without O
forcing O
it O
I O
could O
get O
it O
to O
work O
. O

Bought O
for O
my O
nook O
color O
. O

Powered O
up O
the O
computer O
and O
battery O
indicator O
said O
46 O
% O
charged O
. O

We O
only O
had O
one O
RCA O
connector O
on O
the O
TV O
, O
so O
needed O
a O
way O
to O
connect O
both O
his O
and O
my O
RCA O
jacks O
to O
the O
same O
outlet O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
find O
one O
that O
will O
be O
able O
and O
willing O
to O
make O
the O
lengthened O
version O
that O
I O
sought O
from O
Kensington O
. O

The O
back O
is O
plastic O
, O
however O
. O

This O
softcover O
feels O
like O
my O
favorite O
cable O
knit O
winter O
sweater O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my15 O
" O
MacBook O

but O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
have O
this O
option O
. O

I O
had O
to O
solder O
a O
few O
broken O
Gogroove O
earbuds O
back O
together O
. O

I O
only O
have O
one O
complaint O
, O
and O
I O
plan O
to O
remedy O
it O
myself O
: O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
is O
" O
permanently O
" O
attached O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
look O
into O
this O
further O
, O
however O
I O
did O
not O
see O
any O
Windows O
XP O
drivers O
available O
from O
Samsung O
for O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
it O
may O
be O
pointless O
for O
me O
to O
even O
bother O
trying O
to O
install O
XP.- O

This O
router O
was O
n't O
too O
bad O
, O
it O
dropped O
my O
internet O
sometimes O
though O
. O

Overall O
, O
we O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
! O

You O
press O
it O
closed O
and O
it O
keeps O
springing O
back O
. O

The O
battery O
arrived O
with O
4 O
of O
5 O
bars O
of O
charge O
and O
was O
a O
pretty O
tight O
fit O
for O
my O
machine O
. O

the O
Intel O
N450 O
version O
. O

I O
've O
gone O
through O
about O
3 O
external O
harddrives O
and O
this O
one O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
one O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

but O
when O
I O
am O
doing O
heavy O
computing O
, O
I O
have O
it O
handy O
. O

6 O
MB O
/ O
sec O
. O

The O
plug O
is O
only O
two O
pronged O
which O
was O
disconcerting O
but O
probably O
wo O
n't O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
same O
applies O
here O
. O

I O
just O
grab O
this O
and O
go O
! O

For O
half O
the O
price O
, O
this O
is O
acceptable O
to O
me O
. O

Ideally O
, O
someone O
could O
just O
turn O
off O
trackpad O
clicks O
, O
but O
that O
feature O
does O
n't O
exist O
... O
so O
just O
turn O
off O
the O
trackpad O
and O
touch O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
used O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
weeks O
as O
bought O
with O
1 O
GB O
& O
Win O
7 O
Basic O
. O

Get O
one O
for O
yourself O
! O

I O
think O
they O
do O
not O
have O
corner O
protection O
because O
that O
is O
the O
first O
part O
of O
a O
shield O
to O
start O
to O
give O
way O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
warranty O
replacement O
issue O
. O

My O
Passport O
2 O
TB O
USB O

It O
could O
also O
be O
used O
to O
give O
your O
favorite O
pair O
of O
headphones O
wireless O
capability O
so O
that O
you O
could O
transmit O
music O
from O
your O
computer O
without O
actually O
being O
connected O
to O
it O
. O

But O
the O
load O
fits O
comfortably O
in O
the O
bag O
and O
has O
quite O
good O
padding O
protecting O
the O
contents O
from O
the O
occasional O
joggle O
. O

Judging O
just O
by O
signal O
strength O
indicator O
. O

but O
i O
use O
it O
at O
home O
for O
a O
less O
bulky O
feel O
to O
using O
my O
iPad O
mini O
. O

Only O
complaint O
is O
that O
both O
the O
bottle O
and O
the O
rag O
are O
pretty O
small O
, O
smaller O
than O
the O
pictures O
would O
have O
you O
believe O
. O

I O
was O
impressed O
right O
away O
with O
the O
heft O
and O
feel O
of O
the O
cable O
. O

Do O
n't O
even O
hesitate O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
for O
it O
because O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
repurchase O
a O
cheaper O
one O
long O
before O
this O
sucker O
ever O
wears O
out O
. O

Could O
have O
been O
a O
really O
nice O
design O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
go O
with O
my O
Acer O
Aspire O
One O
Netbook O
. O

A O
word O
of O
caution O
, O
though O
: O
if O
you O
buy O
this O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
either O
your O
tablet O
has O
a O
USB O
port O
, O
or O
you O
get O
a O
female O
usb O
to O
micro O
usb O
adapter O
. O

I O
read O
all O
of O
the O
reviews O
on O
Amazon O
and O
elsewhere O
, O
and O
for O
the O
money O
, O
this O
HP O
Pavilion O
is O
the O
best O
deal O
. O

I O
blew O
my O
old O
one O
and O
needed O
one O
cheaply O
and O
this O
was O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
had O
to O
order O
a O
mini O
4 O
port O
USB O

I O
'm O
a O
little O
disappointed O
in O
the O
length O
of O
the O
battery O
life O
, O
but O
for O
what O
it O
cost O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
two O
finger O
typer O
. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
BlueRigger O
cord O
I O
've O
purchased O
. O

This O
one O
the O
zippers O
work O
great O
. O

I O
have O
two O
of O
these O
because O
they O
charge O
my O
ipad O
and O
iphones O
while O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
go O
. O

The O
part O
that O
does O
n't O
get O
reception O
is O
a O
room O
I O
would O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
and O
surf O
the O
internet O
on O
my O
downtime O
. O

Lastly O
, O
upon O
inspecting O
the O
powercord O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
there O
are O
some O
imperfections O
in O
the O
sheathing O
... O

The O
other O
thing O
that O
took O
getting O
used O
to O
is O
the O
click O
mouse O
. O

It O
is O
true O
every O
thing O
I O
read O
in O
previous O
reviews O
about O
the O
sound O
level O
you O
can O
get O
with O
this O
small O
size O
speaker O
. O

I O
use O
this O
and O
a O
sleeve O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
the O
pump O
may O
draw O
too O
much O
current O
, O
but O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

The O
touch O
screen O
really O
completes O
the O
included O
Windows O
8 O
, O
and O
makes O
for O
an O
intuitive O
user O
experience O
that O
may O
be O
worth O
your O
giving O
it O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
doubt O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
with O
speed O
, O
good O
memory O
, O
decent O
video O
graphics O
, O
large O
enough O
hard O
drive O
so O
that O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
changing O
it O
soon O
. O

Music O
Library O
( O
iTunes O
, O

Lastfm O
, O

Mediabridge O
is O
the O
only O
brand O
that O
seems O
to O
hold O
up O
to O
my O
abuse O
. O

UPDATE O
9/23/13Definitely O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
described O
above O
. O

When O
the O
mainframe O
was O
down O
, O
the O
terminal O
was O
dead O
. O

( O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
, O
for O
me O
at O
least O
, O
Macs O
are O
far O
superior O
in O
every O
way-- O

Because O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
and O
handles O
were O
well O
design O
for O
comfort O
, O
my O
computer O
does O
n't O
feel O
as O
heavy O
when O
carrying O
it O
in O
the O
case O
even O
though O
it O
is O
about O
7 O
lbs O
. O

Right O
now O
, O
I O
have O
a O
mouse O
, O
keyboard O
, O
24 O
" O
LED O
monitor O
, O
external O
USB O
drive O
, O
Ethernet O
cable O
, O
and O
audio O
cable O
all O
hooked O
up O

I O
added O
an O
extra O
4 O
GB O
SDHC O
card O
and O
still O
have O
plenty O
of O
room O
left O
. O

Popped O
it O
back O
in O
the O
Wide O
Printer O
and O
it O
worked O
! O

I O
'm O
mostly O
using O
my O
new O
toy O
for O
storing O
my O
photos O
. O

Delivered O
as O
advertised O
. O

Worked O
very O
well O
and O
has O
lasted O
over O
a O
year O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

This O
allows O
your O
monitor O
to O
do O
the O
scaling O
. O

The O
color O
is O
great O
, O
pretty O
much O
looks O
like O
the O
photos O
. O

First O
it O
has O
a O
beautiful O
screen O

They O
also O
come O
with O
a O
ear O
bud O
or O
headphone O
plug O
in O
if O
you O
prefer O
. O

Linksys O
puts O
" O
Run O
CD O
First O
" O
stickers O
on O
the O
card O
, O
on O
the O
CD O
, O
all O
over O
the O
box O
. O

So O
on O
the O
weekend O
I O
decided O
to O
do O
a O
test O

This O
is O
a O
simple O
, O
affordable O
case O
that O
is O
just O
what O
I O
needed O
for O
my O
commute O
. O

I O
am O
pleased O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
graphics O
and O
the O
ease O
of O
use O
. O

Good O
solid O
build O
and O
works O
every O
time O
. O

The O
warning O
from O
OS O
X O
is O
to O
replace O
it O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
case O
and O
was O
suprised O
that O
it O
was O
better O
than O
the O
one O
I O
had O
. O

It O
has O
a O
little O
heft O
to O
it O

In O
the O
very O
back O
there O
is O
a O
zipper O
compartment O
that O
has O
a O
cloth O
separator O
in O
it O
where O
I O
usually O
put O
my O
bulky O
laptop O
charger O
. O

Each O
of O
the O
side O
pockets O
allow O
for O
ample O
storage O
of O
memory O
cards O
, O
charger O
cables O
, O
flash O
units O
, O
remotes O
, O
a O
point O
& O
shoot O
camera O
, O
etc O
. O

Jiggled O
the O
battery O
again O
and O
the O
computer O
shut O
off O
. O

No O
file O
transfer O
. O

That O
may O
vary O
depending O
on O
your O
setup O
, O
but O
it O
's O
one O
tiny O
issue O
I O
noticed O
( O
and O
quickly O
came O
to O
ignore O
) O
. O

If O
it O
makes O
sense O
, O
cut O
to O
the O
product O
in O
use O
as O
you O
describe O
your O
experiences O
with O
it O
. O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
compare O
this O
wireless O
adapter O
to O

but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
can O
take O
serious O
quality O
photos O
that O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
disappointed O
, O
even O
if O
you O
are O
a O
serious O
photographer O
with O
fairly O
high O
expectations O
( O
just O
remember O
to O
use O
a O
good O
lens O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
push O
things).I O
have O
been O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
m O
4/3 O
format O
over O
other O
small O
system O
cameras O
for O
some O
time O
now O
. O

I O
bought O
these O
for O
my O
desktop O
, O
and O
I O
partly O
bought O
them O
because O
they O
have O
long O
enough O
cords O
for O
a O
desktop O
. O

Repeatable O
problem O
. O

Definitely O
something O
I O
plan O
on O
getting O
some O
use O
out O
of O
. O

I O
browse O
the O
net O
, O
open O
and O
save O
all O
MS O
Office O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
the O
correct O
instructions O

The O
size O
of O
the O
screen O
bezel O
is O
thick O
for O
my O
taste O
( O
I O
am O
spoiled O
by O
the O
XPS O
13 O
thin O
bezel O
) O
. O

This O
stretcheable O
cord O
does O
not O
make O
mass O
on O
my O
desk O
. O

Only O
gripe O
, O
is O
with O
the O
phone O
's O
protective O
casing O
around O
it O
the O
plug O
does O
not O
fit O
very O
snuggly O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
folks O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O

First O
, O
( O
as O
of O
the O
time O
of O
this O
writing O
) O
, O
I O
paid O
about O
$ O
130 O
which O
seems O
very O
pricey O
for O
a O
keyboard O
dock O
. O

You O
can O
most O
likely O
find O
programs O
that O
will O
meet O
some O
of O
your O
needs O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
website O
that O
uses O
a O
custom O
download O
program O
, O
or O
you O
need O
to O
use O
a O
specific O
password O
manager O
or O
something O
, O
then O
do O
n't O
get O
this O
because O
you O
'll O
just O
be O
returning O
it O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
keyboard O
have O
an O
embedded O
fireware O
defect O
that O
causes O
keyboard O
to O
stop O
working O
at O
random O
times O
forceing O
you O
to O
hard O
reset O
PC O
. O

then O
remove O
battery O
and O
hold O
power O
in O
for O
10 O
seconds O
, O
but O
battery O
back O
inside O
plug O
it O
all O
back O
in O
and O
it O
runs O
great O
! O

From O
what O
I O
have O
read O
MANY O
TOSHIBA O
owners O
are O
having O
the O
same O
strange O
issues O
where O
one O
day O
the O
machine O
simply O
will O
not O
power O
up O
at O
all O
. O

Evo O

G O
the O
stock O
cable O
got O
looseI O
paid O
$ O
20 O
at O
Sprint O
for O
an O
extra O
one O
. O

I O
have O
great O
experience O
with O
returning O
items O
to O
Amazon O
, O
so O
allowed O
me O
to O
make O
the O
purchase O
, O
confident O
that O
I O
'd O
be O
able O
to O
return O
it O
if O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
carefully O
measure O
your O
laptop O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
included O
EMC O
software O
has O
been O
dumbed O
down O
a O
little O
too O
much O
to O
be O
useful O
. O

Very O
easy O
installation O
on O
our O
Windows O
7 O
PC O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
how O
this O
unit O
compares O
to O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
does O
seem O
to O
work O
pretty O
well O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
of O
use O
, O
the O
zipper O
got O
caught O
on O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
, O
and O
it O
left O
a O
small O
scratch O
. O

It O
's O
reasonably O
light O
but O
oddly O
bulky O
and O
empty O
- O
feeling O
. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
ability O
to O
right O
click O
just O
by O
tapping O
with O
three O
fingers O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
review O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
ordering O
the O
Z305 O
from O
Amazon O
for O
$ O
49 O
. O

but O
it O
works O
well O
after O
the O
update O
. O

Hotel O
rooms O
seldom O
provide O
enough O
electrical O
outlets O
so O
this O
little O
guy O
helps O
alleviate O
that O
problem O
without O
having O
to O
carry O
a O
much O
larger O
and O
bulkier O
power O
strip O
. O

I O
also O
do O
n't O
like O
how O
you O
have O
to O
hold O
down O
the O
FN O
key O
to O
use O
the O
most O
basic O
functions O
( O
turning O
the O
screen O
brightness O
up O
and O
down O
, O
wifi O
on O
/ O
off O
, O
volume O
up O
and O
down O
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
use O
2 O
hands O
to O
do O
because O
there O
is O
only O
ONE O
function O
key O

I O
read O
some O
bad O
reviews O
about O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

If O
you O
slide O
your O
hand O
along O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
MBP O
, O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
ridge O
of O
the O
battery O
sticking O
up O
, O
but O
as O
many O
others O
mention O
, O
its O
something O
you O
have O
to O
just O
be O
willing O
to O
live O
with O
in O
exchange O
for O
saving O
$ O
40 O
on O
the O
battery O
... O

For O
those O
who O
intend O
on O
using O
this O
computer O
without O
upgrading O
the O
5400rpm O
to O
a O
SSD O
- O
you O
really O
should O
reconsider O
. O

A+ O
for O
customer O
service O
from O
AnkerDirect O
! O

But O
, O
honestly O
, O
I O
've O
been O
using O
it O
and O
so O
far O
.. O
so O
good O
! O

One O
thing O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
is O
the O
weight O
, O
over O
8 O
pounds O
with O
the O
battery O
, O
much O
heavier O
than O
the O
competition O
. O

I O
was O
just O
so O
bored O
of O
Windows O
and O

WHAT O
YOU O
PAY O
FOR O
, O
SOOOO O
PISSED O
OFF O
! O
! O
! O
! O

This O
bothers O
me O
to O
no O
end O
. O

Sadly O
, O
the O
backpack O
straps O
ca O
n't O
be O
removed O
( O
If O
they O
could O
be O
unclipped O
on O
both O
ends O
you O
could O
leave O
a O
bit O
of O
weight O
behind O
and O
gain O
a O
pocket.)There O
is O
no O
beverage O
bottle O
holder O
, O
although O
admittedly O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
do O
without O
spoiling O
the O
look O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

I O
received O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
shortly O
after O
it O
came O
out O
and O
another O

, O
USB O
mouse O
that O
I O
keep O
in O
the O
bag O
with O
this O
Netbook O
for O
easier O
use O
. O

so O
it O
gets O
alot O
of O
use O
. O

Saw O
a O
fellow O
DJ O
using O
one O
of O
these O
and O
had O
to O
get O
one O
. O

plus O
you O
get O
to O
see O
the O
album O
art O
. O

This O
is O
a O
high O
quality O
case O
and O
does O
a O
great O
job O
protecting O
our O
investment O
in O
a O
laptop O
. O

Thanks O
, O
Case O
Logic O
! O

Well O
made O
and O
good O
looking O
. O

The O
included O
software O
bundle O
is O
a O
mixed O
bag O
. O

I O
like O
the O
keyboard O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
'd O
expect O
that O
for O
such O
a O
strong O
pelican O
case O
; O
but O
be O
warned O
, O
although O
it O
is O
ok O
for O
the O
length O
x O
width O
x O
height O
of O
a O
carry O
on O
, O
that O
does O
n't O
mean O
you O
can O
for O
sure O
carry O
it O
on O
. O

I O
see O
this O
mouse O
has O
some O
raving O
reviews O

I O
got O
another O
sleeve O
from O
Timbuk2 O

The O
battery O
lasts O
forever O
and O
charges O
quickly O
. O

It O
's O
cumbersome O
on O
your O
back O
, O
opening O
it O
is O
a O
PAIN O
and O
not O
nearly O
as O
convenient O
as O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
last O
device O
that O
I O
will O
buy O
because O
I O
will O
upgrade O
with O
a O
HD O
device O
that O
plays O
FLAC O
files O
natively O
sometime O
in O
the O
future O
. O

but O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
range O
that O
I O
needed O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
lower O
- O
priced O
, O
entry O
- O
level O
laptop O
, O
I O
recommend O
. O

The O
cooling O
pad O
includes O
flip O
down O
tabs O
that O
allow O
to O
have O
the O
computer O
slightly O
inclined O
which O
is O
a O
great O
feature O
. O

Overall O
, O
a O
decent O
case O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
it O
. O

As O
always O
with O
Amazon O
, O
great O
delivery O
time O
. O

Took O
it O
to O
the O
UK O
and O
it O
worked O
flawlessly O
. O

but O
it O
seems O
pretty O
quick.- O
because O
it O
uses O
a O
cord O

does O
an O
awesome O
job O
in O
switching O
between O
applications O

say O
enough O
about O
it O

I O
get O
this O
deal O
for O
$ O
20 O

but O
they O
replaced O
it O
immediately O
at O
the O
Apple O
store O
without O
question O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
for O
my O
15 O
. O
6 O
Acer O
laptop O
and O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
needed O
. O

Looks O
like O
an O
ultrabook O
or O
MacBook O
air.- O
everything O

I O
use O
it O
on O
my O
desktop O
. O

You O
can O
check O
out O
the O
multiple O
reviews O
online O
to O
see O
that O
it O
stacks O
up O
very O
well O
against O
most O
comparable O
notebooks O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
about O
what O
the O
original O
battery O
was O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
fine O
and O
if O
you O
set O
your O
browser O
to O
full O
screen O
view O
it O
helps O
make O
the O
10 O
. O
1 O
" O
screen O
adequate O
. O

This O
is O
the O
reason O
I O
choose O
LCD O
over O
plasma O
. O

Went O
with O
official O
unlocked O
Dell O
rom O
. O

and O
we O
have O
several O
IDE O
hard O
drives O
. O

When O
using O
the O
USB O
ports O
on O
the O
same O
side O
, O
they O
can O
get O
entangled O
with O
the O
DVD O
player O
when O
it O
opens O
and O
closes O
. O

I O
figured O
it O
'd O
be O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O

After O
reading O
this O
I O
went O
around O
each O
of O
the O
clips O
in O
sequence O
about O
three O
or O
four O
times O
and O
sure O
enough O
one O
of O
them O
popped O
in O
a O
little O
more O
. O

I O
tried O
using O
the O
G13 O
with O
Photoshop O
, O
Final O
Cut O
Pro O
, O
and O
After O
Effects O
, O
but O
it O
was O
much O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
use O
a O
normal O
keyboard O
. O

It O
's O
even O
prettier O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
front O
is O
a O
fingerprint O
magnet O
. O

The O
computer O
sits O
about O
50 O
feet O
away O
from O
the O
router O
. O

My O
son O
is O
very O
happy O
. O

I O
read O
where O
folks O
got O
bad O
batteries O
from O
the O
start O
, O
and O
others O
that O
had O
theirs O
last O
" O
only O
" O
a O
year O
or O
more O
from O
these O
fine O
vendors O
. O

The O
appearance O
looks O
plain O
to O
me O
as O
compared O
to O
a O
Thule O
, O
but O
considering O
its O
price O
, O
it O
is O
perfect O
for O
travel O
. O

and O
it O
's O
a O
great O
combo O
. O

The O
Medialink O
CD O

But O
after O
6 O
months O
of O
carrying O
around O
the O
power O
brick O
everyday O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
it O
anymore O
! O

Quite O
simply O
, O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
suppose O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
dislodge O
it O
with O
rough O
handling O
because O
of O
corners O
- O
only O
design O
, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
easy O
access O
to O
controller O
. O

Downside O
is O
that O
the O
battery O
pack O
sticks O
out O
a O
bit O
in O
the O
back O
, O
and O
adds O
a O
little O
weight O
. O

4x O

and O

several O
of O
these O
a O
year O
ago O
to O
support O
the O
use O
of O

's O
. O

Considering O
the O
price O
, O
they O
get O
5 O
stars O
. O

Although O
inexpensive O
, O
this O
cable O
worked O
fine O
for O
connecting O

Just O
got O

today O
& O
am O
not O
as O
happy O
with O
it O
as O
I O
was O
hoping O
to O
be O

This O

works O
as O

- O
I O
even O
had O

none O

I O
tried O
checking O
the O

Youtube O
for O
reviews O
on O
this O
product O
before O
ordering O
, O
but O
they O
all O
seemed O
lacking O
, O
especially O
when O
it O
came O
to O
sound O
quality O
. O

The O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
buttons O
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
delay O
in O
response O
time O
for O
of O
some O
of O
functions O
, O
which O
can O
be O
frustrating O
at O
times O

they O

it O

the O

An O

0After O
several O
days O
of O
putting O
this O
case O
to O
the O
test O
on O
an O
Ipad O
Mini O
, O
it O
passed O
with O
flying O
colors O
. O

I O
use O
this O
in O
my O
kitchen O
and O
dining O
area O
( O
which O
is O
a O
very O
large O
area O
) O
and O
it O
truly O
fills O
these O
rooms O
. O

it O
is O
like O
plugging O
into O
a O
power O
outlet O
so O
you O
can O
work O
while O
your O
laptop O
is O
charging O
. O

I O
'm O
hoping O
there O
's O
a O
work O
around O
. O

Gosh O
darn O
is O
this O
thing O
cool O
! O
! O
! O

Still O
when O
I O
start O
writing O
with O
the O
Pen O
the O
recording O
light O
on O
the O
receiver O
does O
not O
come O
on O
. O

People O
get O
what O
they O
pay O
for O
. O

I O
am O
sorry O
for O
my O
poor O
review O
. O

You O
can O
get O
additional O
cables O
and O
adapters O
separately O
( O
I O
would O
strongly O
consider O
getting O
another O
cable O
and O
adapter O
set O
for O
the O
car O
, O
having O
used O
it O
a O
while O
) O
. O

HP O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
good O
build O
with O
these O
. O

My O
bad O
if O
I O
assumed O
otherwise O
, O
but O
its O
not O
clearly O
stated O
either O
. O

And O
it O
audibly O
distorts O
at O
higher O
volumes O
( O
and O
this O
speaker O
can O
get O
amazingly O
loud O
. O
) O

The O
OS O
is O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
. O

If O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
Amazon O
's O
great O
return O
policy O
, O
this O
would O
have O
sucked O
real O
bad O
. O

BUT O
I O
am O
NOT O
constantly O
running O
all O
of O
these O
chargers O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O

I O
chose O
this O
adapter O
for O
its O
7A O
/ O
84W O
rating O
to O
handle O
higher O
loads O
. O

So O
after O
much O
headache O
, O
they O
finally O
asked O
me O
to O
ship O
it O
and O
shipped O
me O
a O
new O
one O
. O

power O
cord O
, O
was O
a O
little O
short O
, O
but O
still O
works O
good O
, O
still O
i O
like O
it O
, O
still O
get O
a O
5 O
star O
rating O
from O
me O

I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
this O
if O
you O
plan O
on O
playing O
games O
on O
here O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
, O
if O
it O
's O
something O
that O
you O
feel O
you O
need O
because O
you O
do O
a O
heavy O
amount O
of O
typing O
on O
the O
Xoom O
itself O
. O

In O
case O
you O
loose O
your O
installation O
disk O
( O
which O
I O
did O
and O
my O
wife O
uninstalled O
the O
card O
for O
some O
reason O
I O
have O
no O
clue O
) O
here O
is O
a O
simple O
way O
to O
find O
the O
drivers O
for O
this O
card O
. O

It O
seems O
it O
is O
very O
directional O
which O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Working O
just O
fine O
. O

It O
's O
much O
too O
heavy O
gauge O
and O
big O
for O
portability O
. O

will O
definitely O
will O
buy O
another O
in O
the O
future O
. O

2 O
WEEK O
UPDATE O

( O

. O

As O
good O
as O
the O
original O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

Well O
made O
cable O
. O

I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
lighting O
fast O
with O
the O
i5 O
and O
the O
SSD O
drive O
which O
I O
want O
to O
put O
into O
all O
my O
computers O
. O

Ok O
, O
I O
found O
something O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
can O
spend O
more O
on O
a O
" O
better O
" O
Chromebook O
and O
get O
a O
better O
screen O
, O
I O
know O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
for O
your O
home O
PC O
etc O
... O

Then O
, O
after O
only O
two O
weeks O
the O
back O
of O
the O
power O
supply O
snapped O
off O
. O

and O
I O
use O
the O
touch O
screen O
to O
scroll O
... O

Recommend O
to O
get O
one O
if O
you O
use O
filters O
and O
need O
to O
organize O
them O
in O
your O
backpack O
. O

You O
are O
the O
best O
in O
the O
world O
! O

Because O
the O
sleeve O
has O
rounded O
corners O
, O
my O
laptop O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
inserted O
into O
the O
rear O
edge O
of O
the O
sleeve O
; O
if O
it O
did O
, O
there O
would O
be O
a O
half O
- O
inch O
of O
empty O
space O
along O
the O
front O
zipper O
edge O
of O
the O
sleeve O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
just O
how O
dirty O
my O
television O
screen O
was O
until O
I O
ordered O
these O
cloths O
! O
! O

( O
It O
just O
looks O
good).My O
eyes O
are O
getting O
older O
, O
and O
the O
bigger O
, O
brighter O
screen O
helps O
a O

is O
well O
made O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
last O
forever O

Also O
, O
the O

was O
quite O
stingy O

the O
length O
of O
both O
the O

there O
is O
the O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
upgrade O
a O
mid-2007 O
Macbook O
Pro O
from O
2 O
GB O
to O
4 O
GB O
. O

A O
fresh O
set O

battery O
used O
to O
last O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
on O
the O
mouse O
, O
now O
it O
's O
3 O
weeks O
max O
. O

When O
I O
purchased O
this O
puter O
the O
original O
owner O
was O
able O
to O
use O
a O
remote O
access O
program O
to O
reinstall O
those O
apps O
with O
his O
Apple O
ID O
, O
so O
I O
could O
use O
it O
, O
but O
I O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
receive O
future O
updates O
. O

Provides O
great O
protection O
and O
iPad O
interaction O
with O
the O
rechargeable O
keyboard O
. O

That O
was O
my O
primary O
purpose O
- O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
a O
5 O
out O
of O
5 O
for O
audio O
. O

PWR+ O
does O
not O
answer O
their O
phone O
, O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
Amazon O
lets O
them O
say O
they O
are O
easy O
to O
contact O
which O
is O
not O
true O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
really O
fault O
this O
system O
for O
is O
the O
plethora O
of O
crapware O
that O
comes O
preinstalled O
. O

Update O
your O
photo O
to O
reflect O
the O
actual O
product O
being O
sold O
, O
it O
will O
take O
all O
of O
three O
minutes O

It O
hesitates O
and O
breaks O
up O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
just O
to O
pick O
up O
again O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
if O
the O
speed O
is O
balanced O
out O
by O
too O
much O
heat O
that O
kills O
the O
machine O
or O
some O
sort O
of O
hidden O
shortcut O
they O
took O
on O
build O
quality O
, O
but O
nobody O
can O
really O
say O
that O
for O
sure O
until O
the O
machine O
has O
been O
out O
a O
couple O
years O
. O

Left O
some O
air O
bubbles O
on O
the O
top O
, O
but O
that O
was O
user O
error O
. O

it O
is O
quite O
straight O
forward O
. O

They O
easily O
fit O
in O
my O
back O
pack O
and O
the O
provided O
case O
keeps O
them O
clean O
and O
easy O
to O
locate O
. O

The O
design O
of O
this O
item O
provides O
significantly O
larger O
air O
channels O
to O
allow O
flow O
across O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
device O
where O
others O
have O
small O
or O
no O
ducting O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
purchase O
of O
a O
cordless O
mouse O
, O
and O
I O
love O
it O
! O

It O
is O
kind O
of O
slow O
at O
times O
and O
sometimes O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
me O
. O

it O
zippers O
over O
my O
macbook O
air O
and O
keeps O
dust O
and O
other O
junk O
from O
getting O
into O
it O
. O

My O
son O
has O
had O
no O
complaints O
about O
performance O
and O
he O
watches O
movies O
on O
it O
. O

Plugged O
it O
in O
, O
downloaded O
firmware O
updates O
automatically O
, O
downloaded O
the O
software O
automatically O
and O
started O
up O
my O
CoPilot O
software O
. O

This O
case O
is O
a O
nice O
cross O
between O
a O
thin O
neoprene O
and O
a O
larger O
, O
heavier O
case O
. O

There O
are O
some O
times O
when O
the O
screen O
gets O
that O
slightly O
pixelated O
look O
, O
but O
not O
very O
much O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
example O
of O
using O
space O
well O
. O

Lenovo O
has O
made O
a O
great O
working O
tablet O
for O
windows O

with O
full O
windows O

running O
on O
the O
tablet O

This O
is O
a O
mixed O
blessing O
. O

A O
positively O
gorgeous O
laptop O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
features O
built O
in O
that O
cost O
extra O
with O
PC O
's O
and O
are O
no O
means O
anywhere O
as O
cool O
. O

Half O
of O
what O
I O
expected O
but O
better O
than O
my O
old O
battery O
. O

The O
mic O
is O
nt O
the O
best O
in O
the O
world O
, O
but O
that O

output O
setting O
is O
just O
what O
my O
Acer O
wanted O
. O

In O
each O
and O
every O
test O
the O
Super O
. O

I O
purchased O
( O
2 O
) O
of O
these O
" O
BMW O
" O
style O
mice O
. O

I O
really O
like O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
nice O
shiny O
metallic O
finishes O
usually O
associated O
with O
Acer O
laptops O
. O

It O
has O
a O
compartment O
in O
the O
back O
and O
two O
in O
the O
front O
. O

and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
establish O
both O
wired O
and O
wireless O
communication O
with O
my O
computers O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
spend O
the O
effort O
to O
return O
, O
but O
would O
not O
buy O
again O
. O

I O
have O
upgraded O
my O
phone O
now O
and O
need O
a O
new O
cable O
, O
but O
I O
LOVE O
the O
micro O
auto O
charger O
. O

Once O
you O
install O
the O
metal O
hardware O
on O
the O
new O
drive O
, O
slide O
it O
back O
in O
the O
location O
from O
where O
the O
old O
drive O
was O
in O
. O

This O
means O
you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
charge O
your O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
too O
far O
. O

I O
keep O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
stand O
up O
container O
beside O
my O
recliner O
. O

It O
does O
come O
with O
large O
amount O
of O
pre O
- O
installed O
' O
crapwares O
' O
. O

Does O
the O
speaker O
suck O
that O
much O
juice O
from O
the O
speaker O
? O

The O
perfect O
solution O
to O
a O
nuisance O
problem O
. O

so O
I O
had O
to O
move O
it O
to O
a O
power O
strip O
. O

If O
this O
Anker O
product O
lasts O
over O
a O
year O
, O
I O
will O
not O
hesitate O
to O
purchase O
the O
battery O
they O
offer O
for O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
Dell O
. O

I O
usually O
have O
the O
phone O
with O
me O
anyway O
, O
and O
once O
paired O
the O
devices O
recognize O
each O
other O
every O
time O
, O
so O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
grabbing O
the O
speaker O
unit O
and O
taking O
it O
where O
I O
need O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
these O
are O
cheap O
- O

This O
is O
an O
excellent O
investment O
for O
any O
gamer O
. O

Normally O
there O
is O
an O
evaluation O
fee O
of O
$ O
50 O
for O
the O
mobile O
computing O
device O
for O
out O
of O
warranty O
products O
. O

It O
boots O
up O
fast O
and O
amazon O
instant O
and O
hulu O
work O
great O
on O
it O
. O

Just O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

It O
works O
great O
in O
my O
car O
. O

I O
prop O
mine O
up O
often O
while O
typing O
( O
on O
a O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
) O
and O
am O
concerned O
that O
the O
edges O
that O
are O
n't O
protected O
will O
get O
scratched O
up O
. O

This O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
" O
professional O
" O
level O
computer O
and O
they O
screw O
us O
out O
of O
a O
battery O
or O
power O
indicator O
! O

the O
only O
difference O
- O
ram O
is O
4 O
instead O
of O
6 O
, O
procesor O
is O
2 O
. O

The O
nice O
thing O
about O
coupling O
this O
keyboard O
with O
an O
M500 O
series O
Palm O
is O
that O
you O
can O
have O
instant O
- O
on O
versatility O
. O

While O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
TT O
is O
above O
average O
, O
there O
are O
a O
few O
elements O
of O
construction O
that O
suffer O
. O

I O
also O
got O
the O
Keyboard O
Portfolio O
Stand O
Case O
to O
go O
with O
it O

None O
of O
the O
T O
model O
ever O
had O
accidental O
damage O
, O
although O
one O
had O
a O
hard O
drive O
that O
ever O
so O
slowly O
self O
distructed O
- O
I O
had O
time O
to O
save O
the O
data O
and O
replace O
it O
. O

I O
can O
pretty O
much O
walk O
around O
my O
1700 O
sq O

Which O
would O
be O
fine O
if O
this O
were O
a O
travel O
adapter O
, O
but O
it O
's O
clearly O
labeled O
for O
home O
use O
and O
really O
needs O
to O
allow O
for O
more O
room O
to O
maneuver O
. O

I O
put O
a O
solid O
state O
hard O
drive O
in O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
it O
and O
upgraded O
to O
Windows O
8 O
. O

The O
memory O
has O
worked O
error O
free O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

This O
is O
where O
I O
drop O
the O
rating O
two O
stars O
. O

It O
was O
subtly O
just O
a O
little O
too O
wide O
, O
and O
I O
was O
making O
typos O
at O
a O
much O
higher O
rate O
than O
usual O
. O

One O
of O
the O
biggest O
selling O
points O
( O
or O
detraction O
) O
from O
a O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
is O
its O
ease O
of O
setup O
. O

When O
trouble O
shooting O
the O
device O
, O
I O
received O
clear O
easy O
to O
follow O
instructions O
. O

Length O
is O
as O
advertised O
. O

The O
version O
of O
this O
cord O
from O
Importer O
520 O
arrived O
on O
time O
( O
in O
10 O
days O
) O
and O
works O
fine O
charging O
a O
Kindle O
Fire O
from O
a O
laptop O
USB O
port O
. O

In O
general O
use O
, O
I O
seem O
to O
get O
two O
or O
three O
hours O
between O
charges O
. O

It O
took O
a O
minute O
to O
connect O
with O
my O
Iphone O
and O
Ipad O
and O
the O
sound O
is O
fantastic O
. O

but O
now O
I O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
'm O
more O
productive O
and O
spending O
less O
time O
" O
fitzing O
" O
w/ O
my O
machine O
. O

Like O
most O
external O
speakers O
, O
this O
device O
can O
be O
connected O
via O
Bluetooth O
, O
or O
hard O
wired O
using O
a O
standard O
1/8 O
" O
audio O
cord O
. O

This O
has O
great O
sound O
for O
the O
size O
and O
price O
. O

Removing O
that O
divider O
also O
gives O
a O
bit O
more O
room O
. O

This O
remote O
works O
perfect O
for O
my O
Sony O
A-77 O
and O
Sony O
A-57 O
cameras O
. O

so O
they O
said O
they O
would O
ship O
replacement O
today O
. O

The O
current O
version O
of O
VirtueDesktops O
already O
supports O
the O
light O
and O
motion O
sensors O
to O
switch O
between O
virtual O
desktops O
. O

After O
buying O
this O
to O
have O
a O
second O
monitor O
for O
my O
laptop O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
issues O
. O

so O
I O
ran O
some O
very O
simple O
test O
with O
DiskBench O
. O

When O
registering O
, O
the O
actual O
make O
and O
model O
does O
show O
up O
. O

The O
Prime O
got O
noticeably O
warm O
, O
since O
the O
display O
has O
to O
be O
on O
constantly O
, O
and O
GPS O
performance O
was O
marginal O
( O
I O
lost O
signal O
if O
I O
laid O
the O
pad O
on O
the O
passenger O
seat O
. O
) O

Also O
works O
with O
my O
latest O
updated O
Nexus O
5 O
phone O
. O

ASUS O
claims O
that O
the O
G750JX O
can O
resume O
from O
sleep O
in O
2 O
seconds O
thanks O
to O
its O
Instant O
On O
power O
management O
technology O
. O

anyways O
before O
i O
babble O
on O
and O
on O
these O
work O
perfect O
for O
the O
newest O
macbook O
pros O
so O
do O
nt O
worry O
about O
the O
compatibility O

It O
's O
A O
Camera O
plug O
in O
it O
works O

The O
skin O
itself O
is O
pretty O
thick O
, O
the O
ink O
in O
the O
design O
is O
really O
well O
done O
, O
no O
smudges O
or O
anything O
, O
real O
crisp O
lines O
. O

It O
does O
come O
with O
Skype O
( O
and O
the O
webcam O
quality O
was O
very O
good O
, O
given O
that O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
only O
.3 O
megapixels O
) O
, O
Works O
, O
Windows O
Live O
and O
a O
trial O
for O
both O
Norton O
Netbook O
Security O
Suite O
and O
Office O
2007 O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
realize O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
DVD O
, O
which O
has O
been O
an O
adjustment O
, O
and O
the O
weird O
, O
screw O
on O
plug O
is O
positively O
huge O
; O
it O
literally O
takes O
up O
my O
whole O
power O
strip O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
vindictive O
teen O
or O
someone O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
on O
your O
system O
it O
is O
an O
effective O
system O
, O
but O
buy O
two O
in O
case O
they O
take O
revenge O
and O
swipe O
the O
reader O
. O

They O
are O
a O
bit O
shorter O
overall O
than O
my O
iPhone O
4 O
so O
they O
are O
n't O
very O
long O
at O
all O
. O

This O
is O
STILL O
my O
laptop O
bag O
, O
and O
it O
still O
looks O
great O
, O
still O
works O
perfect O
, O
and O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
still O
does O
nt O
even O
have O
ONE O
tear O
or O
popped O
stitch O
I O
can O
find O
. O

Perfect O
size O
for O
music O
devices O
, O
computers O
, O
or O
tablets O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
battery O
as O
a O
good O
backup O
source O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
with O
my O
desktop O
's O
monitor O
, O
mouse O
and O
keyboard O
, O
and O
I O
switch O
at O
will O
between O
the O
two O
machines O
. O

The O
screen O
rotates O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
use O
that O
a O
lot O
since O
I O
use O
my O
iPad O
a O
lot O
but O
other O
than O
showing O
peeps O
have O
not O
used O
. O

Works O
well O
when O
the O
batteries O
are O
connected O
, O
but O
the O
battery O
case O
does O
not O
hold O
the O
batteries O
snugly O
in O
place O
and O
a O
little O
jouncing O
beyond O
normal O
operation O
can O
jar O
the O
connections O
loose O
. O

It O
's O
cheap O
and O
I O
suggest O
that O
it O
's O
used O
as O
a O
temporary O
measure O
until O
the O
port O
gets O
fixed O
or O
a O
better O
sounding O
and O
constructed O
audio O
device O
can O
be O
purchased O
. O

good O
for O
travel O
with O
small O
laptop O

Its O
specs O
are O
on O
the O
same O
level O
as O
some O
high O
- O
end O
Windows O
gaming O
laptops O
but O
has O
twice O
the O
battery O
life O
and O
almost O
3 O
times O
the O
display O
resolution O
. O

Cloths O
are O
thicker O
than O
the O
ones O
you O
get O
from O
Apple O
, O
but O
not O
bulky O
at O
all O
. O

so O
I O
can O
run O
VMware O
workstation O
along O
with O
several O
VMs O
concurrently O
. O

The O
new O
adapter O
works O
great O
. O

This O
chord O
continued O
to O
need O
replacement O
tips O
. O

and O
I O
keep O
my O
Cokin O
filters O
in O
there O
cases O
. O

All O
of O
them O
either O
read O
from O
script O
or O
are O
robots O
. O

For O
me O
a O
perfect O
laptop O
is O
one O
that O
is O
not O
dog O
slow O
like O
a O
netbook O
and O
also O
one O
that O
wo O
n't O
incinerate O
. O

Lags O
when O
typing O
etc O
. O

A O
fairly O
useful O
feature O
. O

Still O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
given O
that O
the O
initial O
price O
( O
stock O
setup O
) O
was O
599 O
. O

Update O
: O
five O
weeks O
on O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
about O
five O
hours O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

Keys O
felt O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
improved O
is O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
had O
come O
to O
expect O
good O
quality O
products O
from O
Soundblaster O
but O
this O
far O
surpasses O
that O
description O
. O

It O
is O
well O
- O
padded O
inside O
, O
not O
just O
front O
and O
back O
but O
also O
in O
the O
corners O
( O
where O
your O
stuff O
always O
lands O
when O
you O
drop O
it O
, O
so O
why O
do O
so O
many O
cases O
NOT O
protect O
the O
corners).There O

Seller O
had O
them O
nicely O
packaged O
in O
original O
box O
. O

Note O
that O
the O
265 O
WT O
power O
cable O
with O
the O
lifetime O
maps O
can O
be O
used O
for O
some O
other O
Garmins O
. O

all O
you O
need O
to O
know O
is O
that O
it O
works O
. O

I O
love O
this O
mouse O

My O
only O
real O
complaint O
about O
this O
mouse O
is O
the O
price O
. O

needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
. O

received O
it O
earlier O
than O
expected O
and O
in O
perfect O
working O
order O
. O

which O
is O
$ O
199 O
) O
or O
have O
it O
installed O
( O
so O
the O
necessary O
codecs O
can O
also O
be O
used O
by O
iMovie O
, O
I O
suspect O
) O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
me O
, O
this O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
trivial O
issue O
. O

I O
have O
read O
that O
there O
are O
lesser O
cases O
of O
backlight O
bleeding O
with O
the O
52 O
" O
, O
but O
that O
's O
probably O
partly O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
52 O
" O
is O
3 O
" O
less O
in O
size O
. O

HP O
Pavilion O
DV6 O
- O
2170US O
. O

They O
look O
good O
, O
powered O
by O
USB O
, O
and O
have O
some O
fancy O
blue O
glowing O
pedestals O
. O

so O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
USB O
wifi O
adapter O
and O
decided O
on O
the O
medialink150 O
. O

That O
has O
indeed O
been O
the O
case O
with O
me O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
this O
keyboard O
. O

I O
did O
say O
these O
are O
children O
handling O
the O
mouse O
easily O
and O
comfortably O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
that O
one O
commentator O
has O
this O
exact O
machine O
and O
is O
happy O
with O
it O
NOW O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
he O
will O
be O
happy O
with O
it O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
nice O
and O
long O
, O
making O
for O
easy O
movement O
around O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
tried O
it O
on O
three O
different O
android O
phones O
, O
and O
[ O
1 O
] O
the O
AC O
plug O
arrangement O
is O
such O
that O
you O
have O
to O
tinker O
with O
it O
just O
to O
get O
it O
to O
make O
contact O
, O
and O
[ O
2 O
] O

Would O
also O
be O
good O
if O
someone O
-- O
the O
manufacturer O
here O
or O
someone O
else O
-- O
made O
an O
app O
that O
made O
turning O
Bluetooth O
on O
and O
off O
one O
- O
click O
simple O
, O
instead O
of O
having O
to O
wade O
deep O
into O
mobile O
device O
interfaces O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Though O
the O
whole O
process O
still O
only O
took O
about O
20 O
minutes O
. O

Every O
tablet O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
( O
including O
the O
Fujitsu O
I O
almost O
got O
and O
may O
yet O
add O
to O
the O
collection O
) O
runs O
HOT O
. O

Quality O
appears O
to O
be O
good O
. O

It O
, O
like O
the O
first O
one O
gives O
me O
about O
4 O
hours O
of O
run O
and O
really O
does O
n't O
add O
too O
much O
weight O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
think O
I O
'd O
pay O
for O
a O
physical O
backup O
- O
how O
much O
do O
you O
want O
Asus O
, O

to O

days O
after O

I O
own O
several O

and O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
just O

The O

holds O
my O

With O
the O

This O
is O
my O
second O
bag O
. O

It O
is O
also O
quite O
cheap O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
competitors O
. O

The O
laptop O
inclines O
quite O
a O
bit O
from O
what O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
uncomfortable O
at O
all O
and O
the O
rubber O
' O
grips O
' O
seem O
to O
do O
their O

very O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
charged O
more O
fully O
than O
the O
charger O
that O
came O
with O
the O
laptop O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
impressed O
! O

so O
it O
gives O
you O
the O
mental O
reassurance O
that O
its O
protected O
. O

Good O
size O
and O
weight O
makes O
it O
very O
portable O
within O
affordable O
budget O
. O

The O
Sony O
Sales O
Rep O
told O
me O
that O
the O
new O
driver O
updates O
would O
take O
care O
of O
all O
my O
troubles O

I O
have O
nt O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
a O
hair O
dryer O
and O
can O
be O
heard O
loudly O
across O
a O
room O
. O

Do O
n't O
listen O
to O
the O
person O
who O
gave O
the O
case O
just O
3 O
stars O
simply O
because O
of O
the O
handle O
placement O
. O

Well O
, O
that O
did O
the O
trick O
! O

I O
'd O
really O
like O
to O
use O
that O
slot O
. O

First O
the O
refurbished O
aspect O
is O
very O
good O
. O

If O
you O
entered O
all O
the O
data O
right O
, O
you O
should O
see O
a O
green O
Ralink O
logo O
in O
the O
tray O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
bag O
. O

With O
newer O
movies O
, O
like O
FLAGS O
OF O
OUR O

, O
THE O

On O
mine O
, O
all O
the O
red O
wires O
from O
the O
fans O
were O
connected O
with O
one O
of O
the O
USB O
wires O
on O
one O

terminal O
and O
all O
the O
black O

were O
connected O
with O
the O
other O
USB O
wire O
on O
the O
other O

. O

I O
ordered O
a O
Ext O

Enclosure-- O

I O
tryed O
it O
again O
with O
just O
using O
the O
digital O
recorder O
and O
everything O
was O
crystal O
clear O
. O

can O
be O
considered O
as O
thick O
and O
heavy O
. O

It O
has O
one O
the O
brightest O
and O
lustrous O
screens O
you O
've O
ever O
seen O
on O
a O
laptop O
/ O
that O
you O
've O
every O
seen O
in O
the O
world O

Probably O

. O

Press O
ESC O
to O
go O
back O
from O
a O
menu O
option O
. O

I O
used O
it O
for O
copying O
my O
old O
data O
when O
upgrading O
my O
drives O
in O
my O
PC O
laptop O
and O
Mac O
laptop O
and O
putting O
my O
original O
drives O
into O
the O
case O
after O
upgrading O
worked O
fine O
on O
both O
drives O
without O
any O
reformatting O
. O

After O
I O
peeled O
it O
off O
, O
there O
was O
no O
residue O
as O
promised O
and O
I O
'm O
very O
very O
happy O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
. O

Plus O
, O
when O
you O
are O
a O
slob O
like O
ME O
, O
god O
only O
knows O
where O
I O
leave O
things O
.... O

The O
metal O
case O
will O
get O
hot O
but O
that O
is O
how O
the O
case O
keeps O
the O
hard O
drive O
cooler O
. O

It O
protects O
teh O
camera O
but O
its O
not O
hudge O
! O

I O
connected O
this O
to O
a O
charger O
, O
and O
to O
my O
Samsung O
S3 O
hdmi O
adapter O
( O
to O
my O
S4 O
) O
, O
as O
the O
adapter O
's O
power O
source O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
traveled O
with O
this O
backpack O
last O
week O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
fitting O
it O
under O
the O
seat O
in O
front O
of O
me O
during O
the O
flight O
. O

I O
noticed O
most O
negative O
reviews O
are O
from O
people O
that O
are O
not O
" O
Verified O
Amazon O
Purchase O
" O
so O
they O
must O
have O
bought O
it O
at O
a O
Walmart O
, O
Target O
, O
Office O
Depot O
etc O
.. O

Originally O
had O
the O
9 O
cell O
Dell O
battery O

BUT O
, O
this O
very O
function O
messes O
up O
the O
key O
's O
assigned O
functions O
( O
Spaces O
, O
Dashboard O
, O
Expos&eacute O
; O
, O
etc O
... O
) O
which O
makes O
it O
a O
toss O
- O
up O
between O
choosing O
either O
the O
Expos&eacute O
; O
functions O
or O
the O
Volume O
/ O
Brightness O
functions O
. O

It O
's O
got O
GREAT O
compartments O
and O
zipper O
options O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
wear O
it O
too O
long O
or O
I O
start O
to O
get O
a O
headache O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

also O
the O
touch O
pad O
is O
a O
bit O
sensitive O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
from O
my O
palm O
often O
moves O
the O
cursor O
to O
some O
other O
place O
, O
and O
i O
have O
to O
disable O
the O
touch O
pad O
when O
i O
type O
. O

If O
you O
have O
to O
take O
the O
product O
off O
be O
very O
careful O
because O
if O
you O
peel O
it O
off O
by O
the O
edges O
the O
edges O
will O
crease O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
get O
those O
creases O
out O
. O

It O
feels O
like O
they O
designed O
the O
computer O
to O
do O
a O
job O
and O
then O
priced O
it O
accordingly O
rather O
than O
deciding O
on O
a O
price O
and O
then O
cutting O
costs O
to O
meet O
it O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
screen O
protector O
that O
was O
n't O
noticeable O
but O
kept O
fingerprints O
and O
grime O
off O
the O
screen O
of O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
got O
my O
replacement O
and O
installed O
it O
without O
a O
glitch O
( O
thanks O
to O
another O
reviewer O
's O
instruction O
) O
. O

It O
shows O
monstrous O
number O
of O
errors O
being O
corrected O
by O
Firmware O
, O
which O
is O
a O
bad O
sign O
which O
means O
your O
data O
is O
going O
to O
be O
lost O
one O
day O
or O
another O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
card O
and O
checked O
my O
device O
manager O
and O
it O
showed O
up O
under O
other O
devices O
code O
10 O
needing O
a O
driver O
. O

Okay O
, O
I O
'll O
also O
share O
with O
you O
the O
stock O

. O

True O
, O
but O
what O
the O
description O
does O
n't O
tell O
you O
, O
it O
can O
only O
be O
one O
phone O
. O

They O
stated O
that O
the O
enclosure O
should O
not O
have O
failed O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
click O
RECONNECT O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
a O
lab O
rat O
pressing O
a O
lever O
, O
with O
no O

:( O

The O
3/4 O

is O
worthless O
to O
me O
because O
T O
- O
Mobile O
does O
n't O
reach O
my O
part O
of O
the O
US O
. O

It O
's O
simple O
yet O
versatile O
, O
and O
it O
's O
made O
with O
travel O
and O
usability O
in O
mind O
. O

And O
this O
met O
all O
my O
needs O
. O

So O
, O
I O
contacted O
toshiba O
: O
and O
you O
can O
be O
sure O
that O
it O
WAS O
BY O

Once O
I O
changed O
the O
setting O
no O
more O
problem O
. O

Works O
great O
with O
an O
extra O
monitor O
at O
work O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
get O
it O
to O
appear O
in O
Ghost O
at O
all O
( O
no O
matter O
what O

The O
screws O
lined O
up O
fine O
for O
me O
unlike O
other O
reviewers O
report O
, O
but O
I O
found O
you O
really O
could O
n't O
tell O
when O
they O
were O
fully O
tight O
- O
they O
went O
in O
with O
much O
effort O
from O
the O
start O
- O
so O
that O
I O
ended O
up O
stripping O
at O
least O
one O
of O
them O
, O
and O
then O
knew O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
with O
the O
other O
3 O
. O

Took O
a O
while O
before O
I O
was O
able O
to O
use O
it O
, O
but O
once O
I O
started O
to O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

The O
beats O
audio O
turnwheel O
is O
too O
loose O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
Toshiba O
that O
has O
the O
Truebrite O
. O

I O
like O
the O
design O
of O
this O
case O
a O
lot O
. O

Logitech O
did O
another O
great O
job O
on O
this O
product O
. O

Install O
was O
not O
as O
easy O
as O
the O
2009 O
model O
I O
upgraded O

One O
final O
note O
, O
the O
original O
panel O
was O
an O
LG O
, O
so O
that O
might O
be O
the O
one O
to O
replace O
. O

so O
well O
you O
can O
control O
phones O
with O
call O
waiting O
and O
if O
your O
phones O
have O
voice O
command O
it O
works O
as O
well O
. O

After O
getting O
there O
and O
going O
through O
the O
Quick O
Internet O
Setup O
, O
there O
are O
a O
few O
things O
that O
I O
found O
that O
were O
needed O
to O
make O
the O
EA O
N66 O
work O
consistently O
: O
. O

If O
they O
keep O
it O
for O
a O
month O
its O
just O
a O
month O
of O
warranty O
gone O
. O

It O
all O
depends O
on O
the O
way O
you O
use O
it O
. O

I O
decided O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
start O
walking O
instead O
of O
using O
my O
car O
for O
exercise O
and O
cause O
gas O
prices O
are O
so O
crazy O
lately O
and O
are O
only O
gon O
na O
get O
worse O
. O

gb O
ram O
w/750 O
gb O
hard O
drive O
this O
solid O
for O
this O
price O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
use O
iTunes O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
, O
or O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
, O
this O
may O
be O
the O
only O
* O
real O
* O
problem O
one O
could O
face O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
its O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
recalibrate O
from O
time O
to O
time O
as O
your O
monitor O
will O
fluctuate O
slightly O
over O
time O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
connect O
my O
IPOD O
. O

Love O
Amazon O

I O
have O
not O
tried O
fan O
based O
pads O

- O
this O
little O
guy O
is O
small O
. O

The O
shock O
absorbing O
straps O
and O
air O
vented O
back O
are O
perfect O
for O
riding O
, O
even O
with O
heavy O
cargo O
. O

Figured O
I O
'd O
throw O
out O
that O
this O
does O
work O
with O
an O
adapter O
and O
a O
220V O
outlet O
. O

Not O
as O
matte O
as O
some O
others O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
high O
gloss O
like O
other O
Samsung O
LCD O
's O
. O

It O
has O
more O
powers O
with O
its O
size O
, O
strength O
and O
statue O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
play O
it O
safe O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
spend O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

This O
is O
not O
true O
of O
the O
past O
when O
Lenovo O
did O
included O
mSATA O
connector O
for O
the O
Y480/Y580 O
and O
earlier O
models O
( O
even O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
purchase O
SSD O
options O
) O
. O

I O
paid O
$ O
350 O
for O
my O
6x11 O
4 O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
I O
could O
still O
sell O
it O
on O
ebay O
for O
a O
couple O
hundred O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O

A O
useful O
and O
functional O
bag O
. O

It O
is O
speedy O
, O
has O
good O
wifi O
connectivity O
, O
and O
has O
all O
of O
the O
features O
I O
would O
expect O
when O
buying O
a O
pricier O
model O
of O
computer O
such O
as O
a O
webcam O
and O
HDMI O
port O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
cold O
chills O
from O
the O
fans O

Once O
asleep O
it O
may O
take O
several O
keypresses O
before O
you O
get O
typing O
to O
appear O
on O
the O
device O
. O

3 O
inch O
LED O
/ O
LCD O
monitor O
and O
looks O
good O
, O
then O
this O
Acer O
laptop O
is O
for O
you O
. O

Again O
, O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
the O
G74 O
DOESN'T O
do O
that O
- O
it O
just O
has O
a O
normal O
setup O
where O
the O
integrated O
graphics O
are O
NOT O
used O
, O
and O
the O
Geforce O
GTX O
560 O
is O
what O
's O
connected O
directly O
to O
the O
monitor O
.... O

Now O
I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
going O
up O
to O
32 O
Gigs O
. O

Zippers O
seem O
above O
average O
and O
the O
strap O
is O
what O
you O
would O
expect O
but O
with O
nice O
hardware O
( O
metal O
and O
pretty O
easy O
to O
remove.)I O
use O
it O
without O
the O
strap O
because O
the O
handle O
is O
sturdy O
and O
has O
nice O
foam O
padding O
. O

My O
mistake O
assuming O
broadcom O
is O
the O
only O
BT O
chip O
set O
maker O
in O
the O
game O
. O

it O
's O
going O
, O
it O
keeps O
going O
fine O
, O
even O
if O
yours O
drops O
into O
that O
mode O
on O
startup O
. O

But O
not O
me O
, O
since O
I O
'm O
an O
on O
- O
the O
- O
go O
person O
who O
needs O
a O
more O
portable O
and O
reliable O
computer O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
bag O
. O

The O
fans O
get O
their O
power O
via O
a O
USB O
cord O
, O
which O
has O
a O
pass O
- O
through O
connector O
on O
the O
computer O
side O
, O
so O
you O
can O
still O
connect O
another O
device O
to O
that O
port O
. O

The O
tablet O
has O
Bluetooth O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
it O
would O
n't O
work O
with O
the O
KB&M O
without O
it O
's O
dongle O
. O

And O
I O
expect O
that O
gripping O
it O
wo O
n't O
present O
a O
problem O
for O
people O
with O
somewhat O
diminished O
hand O
strength O
( O
I O
have O
had O
that O
problem O
, O
so O
I O
am O
sensitive O
to O
it O
) O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
use O
it O
for O
text O
entry O
while O
traveling O
and O
commuting O
, O
but O
I O
am O
having O
a O
whale O
of O
a O
time O
trying O
to O
adjust O
to O
the O
continual O
skipping O
and O
jumping O
of O
the O
cursor O
. O

If O
it O
stops O
working O
, O
put O
new O
batteries O
in O
and O
you O
are O
good O
to O
go O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
the O
adapter O

The O
audio O
only O
works O
over O
HDMI O
so O
if O
you O
have O
an O
HDMI O
enabled O
monitor O
with O
built O
in O
speakers O

but O
when O
i O
switched O
on O
again O
it O
started O
up O
where O
it O
left O
off O
. O

External O
Hard O
drive O
, O
using O
CrystalDiskMark O
, O
and O
found O
the O
following O
results O
: O

max O

rating O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
bag O
is O
made O
of O
hemp O
/ O
organic O
cotton O
/ O
recycled O
plastic O
bottles O
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

You O
could O
however O
share O
a O
cd O
drive O
on O
your O
network O
from O
another O
computer O
using O
Map O
drives O
( O
built O
into O
windows O
) O
and O
I O
think O
that O
would O
work O
for O
most O
uses O
if O
you O
do O
not O
have O
an O
external O
. O

It O
works O
really O
well O
, O
the O
fan O
is O
quiet O

Very O
pleased O
with O
this O
upgrade O

It O
was O
an O
amazing O
improvement O
right O
away O
, O
opening O
multiple O
programs O
, O
running O
large O
pro O
tools O
sessions O
, O
everything O
was O
just O
quicker O
and O
more O
responsive O
. O

A O
hardware O
volume O
control O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
it O
is O
really O
not O
necessary O
since O
Windows O
places O
a O
software O
volume O
control O
in O
the O
lower O
- O
right O
corner O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

It O
's O
professional O
yet O
practical O
. O

so O
I O
could O
really O
run O
& O
# O

; O
with O
it O
. O

The O
pouch O
seems O
sturdy O
. O

I O
should O
have O
known O
better O
. O

We O
really O
need O
a O
better O
option O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
seller O
is O
very O
responsive O
and O
strives O
for O
excellent O
service O
and O
satisfaction O
. O

I O
expect O
a O
glove O
like O
fit O
but O
with O
this O
case O
my O
netbook O
sort O
of O
sloshes O
around O
inside O
. O

Everything O
else O
looks O
and O
works O
great O

Excellent O
product O
love O
the O

great O
job O

Buy O
them O
for O
extra O
in O
case O
you O
are O
like O
me O
, O
always O
loosing O
them O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

, O
I O
'd O
find O
that O
very O
handy O
in O
a O
darker O
setting O
. O

Have O
no O
mobility O
with O
this O
cable O
if O
your O
needing O
a O
charge O
. O

CAN O
GO O
OUT O
THE O
SIDES O
. O

If O
style O
is O
a O
major O
factor O
for O
you O
, O
these O
might O
win O
over O
other O
models O
on O
looks O
alone O
. O

and O
I O
seem O
to O
get O
just O
below O
that O
. O

I O
think O
the O
motherboard O
died O
, O
b O
/ O
c O
my O
HD O
was O
readable O
when O
I O
bought O
the O
new O
Dell O
. O

I O
personally O
think O
it O
fits O
perfect O
. O

This O
battery O
is O
junk O
. O

Bought O
this O
SD O
Class O
6 O
card O
for O
my O
new O
Kodak O
1285 O
camera O
especially O
for O
HD O
videos O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
. O

My O
transfer O
rates O
are O
totally O
bursting O
now O

Design O
is O
very O
good O
, O
smoothy O
.. O

The O
biggest O
use O
for O
computers O
in O
the O
business O
world O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
office O
suites O
and O
Google O
Docs O
does O
a O
pretty O
good O
job O
, O
but O
still O
lacks O
many O
of O
the O
features O
of O
desktop O
office O
suites O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
disappointing O
surprise O
, O
the O
drive O
is O
very O
small O
, O
discrete O
and O
fun O
. O

IPS O
screen O
display O
, O
which O
is O
just O
perfect O
if O
you O
love O
to O
play O
games O
or O
watch O
movies O
. O

I O
returned O
this O
item O
, O
too O
. O

Great O
signal O
strength O
and O
reception O
. O

I O
found O
that O
it O
does O
not O
work O
well O
with O
anything O
but O
the O
included O
mouse O
pad O
. O

Two O
satellite O
speakers O
were O
looking O
good O
and O
I O
gave O
this O
speaker O
system O
to O
my O
wife O
so O
that O
she O
can O
enjoy O
the O
beauty O
of O
it O
. O

I O
love O
the O
touch O
screen O
functionality O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
review O
the O
individual O
aspects O
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

This O
battery O
did O
not O
fit O
my O
laptop O
although O
it O
advertised O
the O
same O
code O
as O
my O
laptop O
battery O
AS07A41 O
. O

You O
can O
just O
tell O
they O
are O
well O
made O
. O

After O
doing O
some O
research O
I O
happened O
to O
find O
this O
unit O
on O
sale O
here O
at O
Amazon O
. O

I O
priced O
an O
OEM O
battery O
and O
freaked O
... O
it O
was O
way O
, O
way O
too O
expensive O
for O
a O
laptop O
that O
I O
figured O
would O
only O
really O
be O
usable O
for O
another O
year O
. O

I O
keep O
a O
speaker O
in O
my O
shop O
and O
in O
my O
bedroom O
and O
one O
in O
my O
carrie O
bag O
. O

The O
color O
is O
extremely O
good O
and O
is O
consistent O
over O
different O
view O
angles O
. O

Please O
read O
about O
this O
problem O
by O
searching O
the O
internet O
. O

A O
few O
things O
before O
I O
really O
get O
into O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
: O
There O
is O
no O
firewall O
to O
configure O
; O
no O
need O
for O
virus O
protection O
; O
system O
is O
automatically O
updated O
without O
bother O
, O
and O
has O
an O
SSD O
( O
solid O
state O
drive O
for O
virtually O
noiseless O
computing O
) O
, O
and O
can O
run O
up O
to O
8 O
to O
9 O
hours O
on O
one O
charge O
. O

I O
really O
like O
using O
this O
on O
a O
plane O

To O
start O
off O
with O
I O
have O
Windows O
7 O
64 O
bit O
. O

Graphics O
and O
speed O
wise O

so O
if O
you O
are O
in O
need O
of O
a O
LAN O
card O
for O
your O
XP O
or O
newer O
OS O
machine O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
or O
the O
service O
. O

The O
usb O
cord O
is O
fairly O
short O
, O
so O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
the O
camera O
like O
a O
movie O
director O

Would O
n't O
be O
a O
bad O
idea O
to O
seal O
it O
up O
carefully O
with O
silicone O
sealant O
! O

Tips O
on O
extended O
warranty O
: O
This O
TV O
comes O
with O
a O
1yr O
service O
/ O
labor O
warranty O
. O

I O
have O
an O
older O
system O
. O

Thanks O
Amazon O
! O

and O
you O
are O
going O
to O
love O
that O
as O
much O
as O
you O
might O
love O
this O
case O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
only O
laptop O
in O
this O
class O
which O
has O
a O
HDMI O
which O
connects O
easily O
to O
my O
LCD O
HDTV O
. O

Convert O
any O
ebooks O
to O
emobi O
files O
for O
my O
Kindle O
Fire O
. O

I O
just O
use O
one O
at O
a O
time O
, O
and O
leave O
the O
rest O
sealed O
. O

Now O
if O
your O
speakers O
are O
turned O
on O
and O
halfway O
across O
the O
room O
, O
you O
can O
play O
your O
music O
, O
podcasts O
, O
or O
whatever O
from O
the O
convenience O
of O
the O
palm O
of O
your O
hand O
and O
have O
the O
room O
fill O
up O
with O
sound O
from O
these O
surprisingly O
quality O
speakers O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
's O
much O
better O
than O
external O
hard O
drive O
enclosures O
considering O
the O
amount O
of O
HDDs O
I O
have O
laying O
around O
the O
house O
... O

4 O
replacements O
later O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
tell O
me O
I O
should O
've O
returned O
it O
with O
tracking O
but O
part O
of O
the O
benefits O
of O
the O
warranty O

The O
first O
time O
you O
turn O
it O
on O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
go O
through O
the O
drawn O
out O
Windows O
8 O
setup O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
for O
anyone O
who O
needs O
a O
replacement O
laptop O
battery O
! O

You O
can O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
your O
money O
during O
the O
Spring O
and O
late O
summer O
, O
as O
well O
as O
during O
mid O
- O
November O
to O
early O
December O
on O
laptops O
. O

In O
my O
computrekker O
i O
have:2 O
camera O
bodies O
( O
digital O
and O
medium O
format O
film O
) O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
true O
netbook O
, O
consider O
the O
1008HA O
instead O
. O

and O
it O
's O
not O
all O
noise O
like O
most O
fans O
are O
. O

It O
even O
has O
a O
joystick O
that O
you O
can O
move O
with O
your O
thumb O
to O
move O
your O
characters O
around O
. O

I O
was O
VERY O
impressed O
with O
this O
card O
, O
and O
the O
price O
is O
almost O
so O
low O

This O
MBPro O
with O
the O
new O
i7 O
2 O
. O

8Ghz O
cordless O
phones O
. O

So O
if O
you O
ever O
plan O
to O
use O
a O
3 O
TB O
drive O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
docking O
station O
for O
you O
. O

This O
product O
did O
NOT O
work O
as O
advertised O
. O

, O
fuction O
well O
, O
i O
use O
it O
once O
in O
a O
while O
, O
its O
big O
enough O
to O
put O
my O
big O
laptop O
inlo O
recomiendoi O
aprove O
tthis O
item O

Seems O
to O
be O
very O
compatible O
and O
all O
the O
services O
showed O
up O
on O
the O
computer O
as O
would O
be O
expected O
and O
my O
devices O
all O
connect O
( O
GPS O
, O
Phones O
, O
headsets O
, O
etc O
) O
to O
my O
desktop O
PC O
now O
. O

Replacement O
was O
easy O
and O
the O
keyboard O
dropped O
into O
all O
the O
correct O
tabs O
and O
slots O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

whatever O
is O
lacking O
in O
the O
Microsoft O
Store O
, O
I O
usually O
can O
find O
a O
free O
, O
powerful O
version O
for O
full O
Windows O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
device O
for O
people O
whose O
laptop O
speakers O
are O
too O
weak O
. O

I O
've O
decided O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O
afford O
cheap O
. O

It O
was O
only O
used O
twice O
as O
carry O
- O
on O
luggage O
, O
never O
as O
checked O
baggage O
, O
so O
how O
it O
fell O
apart O
so O
easily O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

I O
called O
the O
Apple O
customer O
care O
number O
. O

It O
may O
not O
reflect O
every O
user O
's O
experience O
( O
or O
even O
the O
most O
common O
experience O
) O
, O
and O
must O
be O
taken O
with O
a O
grain O
of O
salt O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
convenient O
, O
and O
efficient O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
I O
made O
this O
purchase O
as O
opposed O
to O
another O
Android O
slate O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
great O
use O
for O
the O
year O
. O

The O
longest O
process O
is O
transferring O
music O
to O
the O
phone O
, O
and O
I O
was O
n't O
in O
a O
hurry O
anyway O
. O

com O
for O
about O
$ O
25 O
because O
I O
want O
to O
keep O
the O
bag O
I O
already O
have O
for O
the O
photo O
frame O
& O
the O
accessories O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

I O
was O
sent O
the O
Sage O
and O
Chocolate O
one O
, O
which O
is O
even O
better O
than O
I O
thought O
. O

Was O
concerned O
at O
first O
site O
.. O
they O
are O
awfully O
small O
.. O
but O
after O
plugging O
them O
in O
... O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
great O
value O
.. O
absolutely O
fit O
the O
bill O
for O
what O
I O
needed O

This O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O

works O
great O
, O
got O
it O
quick O
. O

I O
rarely O
put O
it O
in O
the O
case O
as O
is O
intended O
. O

If O
you O
have O
serious O
problems O
with O
the O
looseness O
and O
think O
you O
'll O
be O
playing O
tug O
- O
o O
- O
war O
with O
your O
adapter O
, O
then O
steer O
clear O
. O

this O
cooling O
unit O
, O
spent O
5 O
minutes O
installing O
it O
, O
have O
had O
no O
more O
overheating O
problems O
. O

My O
experience O
with O
it O
was O
frustrating O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
these O
negative O
reviewers O
are O
doing O
, O
but O
whatever O
it O
is O
I O
suspect O
no O
cable O
would O
hold O
up O
. O

Good O
price O
, O
works O
fine O
. O

- O
I O
assume O
that O
is O
the O
JBL O
quality O
at O
work O
. O

The O
biggest O
con O
I O
would O
say O
are O
the O
ZIPPERS O
. O

Here O
, O
the O
plugs O
fit O
snugly O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
work O
themselves O
loose O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

So O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
purchase O
this O
item O
, O
because O
it O
's O
flexible O
for O
our O
notebook O
pc O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
audio O
recording O
performance O
. O

There O
are O
also O
some O
velcro O
pieces O
to O
make O
the O
fit O
snug O
and O
allowing O
the O
extra O
space O
to O
be O
utilized O
. O

Yeah O
, O
you O
spending O
$ O
40 O
vs. O
$ O
25 O
, O
but O
the O
Verbatim O
USB O
adapter O
fell O
apart O
within O
a O
week O

I O
think O
the O
extra O
$ O
10 O

This O
little O
guy O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
so O
much O
more O
with O
my O
network O
- O
and O
its O
ability O
to O
charge O
other O
devices O
is O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
. O

Best O
Part O
: O

Even O
better O
than O
the O
original O
cord O
that O
came O
with O
the O
laptop O
. O

Sideways O
power O
bring O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
on O
my O
surge O
strip O
. O

It O
'll O
fit O
, O
but O
its O
tight O
. O

I O
had O
read O
several O
reviews O
prior O
to O
purchase O
as O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
this O
would O
work O
on O
a O
Mac O
. O

I O
am O
unable O
to O
run O
the O
downloaded O
installer O
. O

It O
is O
slim O
in O
appearance O
, O
but O
can O
get O
allot O
into O
it O
. O

I O
FULLY O
RECOMMEND O
this O
battery O
. O

Attractive O
design O
. O

Wound O
up O
returning O
it O
. O

I O
was O
trying O
to O
use O
it O
as O
a O
way O
to O
get O
bluetooth O
in O
my O
car O
, O
but O
having O
to O
hold O
it O
down O
for O
three O
seconds O
every O
time O
I O
got O
into O
the O
car O
got O
old O
really O
fast O
. O

Just O
feels O
exremely O
solid O
all O
around O
in O
my O
opinion O
and O
I O
love O
this O
power O
supply O
. O

20-A O
2 O
weeks O
now O
, O
and O
I O
compare O
it O
with O
my O
2 O
year O
old O
Dell O
" O
gamer O
" O
desktop O
in O
speed O
and O
clarity O
... O

For O
screening O
purposes O
, O
nothing O
but O
the O
laptop O
should O
be O
stored O
in O
this O
section O
. O

But O
I O
hope O
that O
this O
review O
was O
more O
helpful O
With O
as O
much O
detail O
as O
possible O
. O

It O
also O
charges O
the O
iPhone O
about O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
one O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
( O
5 O
watts O
vs O
4 O
watts O
, O
not O
much O
less O
) O
. O

Yes O
it O
does O
have O
the O

it O
can O
work O
in O
your O

you O
can O

So O
many O
people O
buy O
these O

with O
unreasonable O
expectations O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
can O
not O
yet O
comment O
on O
the O
longevity O
of O
the O
battery O
, O
but O
if O
it O
is O
a O
genuine O

I O
expect O
that O
it O
will O
perform O
satisfactorily O

When O
searching O

it O

It O
came O
with O
a O

was O
great O
to O
get O
rolling O
right O
out O

The O

As O

I O
have O
my O
old O

set O
up O
on O
an O

just O

both O

a O
pretty O

: O

Plastic O

may O
have O
a O
limited O

as O
the O

rather O
thin O
. O

I O
plugged O
it O
into O
a O
USB3 O
hub O
and O
it O
connected O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

Only O
the O
range O
could O
be O
improved O
- O
I O
've O
got O
10 O
' O
ceilings O
and O
its O
weak O
through O
2 O
floors O
. O

Seems O
really O
good O
so O
far O
! O

I O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
so O
far O
. O

Both O
are O
new O
enough O
to O
be O

Surfing O
the O
' O
Net O
is O
faster O
on O
the O
same O
wireless O
connection O
I O
have O
been O
using O
now O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
hard O
wire O
to O
the O
router O
as O
the O
wireless O
connection O
I O
had O
did O
n't O
allow O
a O
good O

. O

The O
other O
two O
way O
too O
tight O
: O

I O
work O
in O
IT O
and O
needed O
a O
bag O
that O
could O
fit O
two O
laptops O
( O
a O
17&#34 O
; O

The O
only O
possible O
downside O
is O
that O
the O
glossy O
finish O
is O
easily O
smudged O
with O
fingerprints O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
some O
brands O
that O
cost O
upwards O
of O
$ O
300 O
and O
saw O
some O
very O
nice O
backpacks O
, O
but O
nothing O
that O
really O
justified O
the O
obscene O
expense O
( O
IMO O
) O
. O

The O
zippers O
are O
very O
easy O
to O
operate O
; O
they O
are O
not O
stiff O
at O
all O
. O

And O
forget O
taking O
notes O
with O
it O
. O

Push O
your O
finger O
down O
on O
the O
top O
and O
the O
noise O
goes O
away O
. O

impressive O
for O
a O
purseall O
i O
'm O
saying O
is O
think O
of O
a O
backpack O
or O
rolly O
bag O
first O
... O

surprising O
that O
it O
's O
that O
loud O
, O
now O
do O
nt O
be O
fooled O
the O
sound O
is O
ok O

I O
end O
up O
using O
this O
more O
than O
my O
ipad O
because O
I O
like O
the O
keyboard O

Also O
, O
having O
two O
fans O
is O
more O
effictive O
. O

Ordered O
this O
for O
a O
new O
computer O
build O
and O
since O
I O
only O
use O
the O
computer O
for O
web O
surfing O
, O
this O
is O
great O
. O

It O
must O
have O
a O
latching O
top O
or O
zipper O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
walls O
and O
floors O
is O
blocking O
the O
signal O
. O

One O
day O
I O
suspect O
the O
bottom O
case O
will O
just O
fall O
off O
. O

I O
now O
have O
a O
full O
" O
n O
" O

system O
. O

So O
far O
it O
fits O
Lenovo O
Thinkpad O
T60 O

. O

The O
plastic O
Cordies O
for O
$ O
13 O
is O
118 O
grams O

Hooked O
it O
up O
to O
the O
digital O
box O

It O
's O
the O
best O
there O
is O
in O
this O
size O
at O
this O
, O
and O
if O
all O
you O
want O
is O
a O
good O
cooler O
, O
you O
're O
set O
; O
go O
get O
it O
, O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
ignore O
the O
other O
functions O
completely O
. O

I O
've O
had O
mine O
for O
a O
couple O
years O
now O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
mouse O
, O
easy O
to O
hold O
and O
has O
worked O
well O
so O
far O
. O

However O
, O
my O
hard O
drives O
are O
encrypted O
so O
at O
61MB O
/ O
second O
my O
CPU O
is O
maxed O
out O
at O
100 O
% O
so O
the O
limit O
could O
be O
due O
to O
my O
CPU O
. O

If O
you O
just O
use O
it O
for O
an O
unprotected O
tablet O
with O
a O
key O
board O
it O
would O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

do O
n't O
know O
what O
I O
'd O
do O
without O
it O
now O
. O

It O
took O
me O
five O
minutes O
to O
install O
. O

It O
locks O
up O
pretty O
well O
on O
my O
lens O
and O
have O
no O
issues O
with O
it O

Did O
not O

, O
the O

FOR O
THE O

ADVERTISED O
WITH O
IT O
, O

" O
so O
I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
at O
first O
but O
the O
seller O
actually O
promptly O
responded O
to O
my O
return O
request O
and O
everything O
went O
smoothly O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
any O
techie O
that O
finds O
him O
/ O
herself O
working O
on O
everyones O
crashed O
computers O
or O
hard O
drives O
. O

Other O
people O
have O
complained O
about O
the O
touchpad O
and O
recommend O
adding O
a O
mouse O
. O

so O
avoid O
that O
piece O
of O
cheap O
crap O
and O
buy O
a O
good O
one O
. O
or O
buy O
this O
at O
your O
very O
own O
risk O
. O

Newer O
models O
keep O
getting O
better O
, O
smaller O
and O
faster O

This O

you O
to O
keep O
your O

be O
told O
the O

of O
the O
street O
you O
need O
to O
turn O

all O

Stumbled O
on O
this O

cheaper O
than O

so O
have O

tried O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O

I O
do O

care O
to O
pay O
30 O

more O
for O

I O
do O

The O

terribly O

, O
but O
they O
're O
not O

either O
. O

It O
has O
sufficient O

to O
keep O
the O

i O
followed O
all O
the O

for O

it O

the O
most O
out O

which O
is O

but O
it O
just O
happens O
to O
work O
well O
also O

If O
I O
'm O
not O
careful O
how O
I O
use O
my O

my O

, O
this O
is O
an O
outstanding O

. O

Computer O
kept O
saying O
it O
could O
not O
locate O
a O
driver O
on O
computer O
and O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
adapter O
because O
the O
original O
adapter O
that O
came O
with O
my O
Lenovo O
3000 O
V100 O
died O
. O

Its O
kind O
of O
like O
how O
different O
amplifier O
companies O
measure O
' O
watts O
' O
differently O
... O

So O
I O
began O
searching O
for O
a O
phantom O
button O
and O
searched O
both O
Dell O
and O
Microhard O
's O
websites O
on O
how O
I O
might O
magically O
reveal O
this O
phantom O
button O
! O

I O
guess O
it O
helps O
to O
zip O
the O
zippers O
over O
to O
one O
side O
. O

It O
is O
extremely O
fast O
, O
very O
compact O
, O
and O
has O
been O
reliable O
so O
far O
. O

So O
I O
did O
a O
little O
surgery O
, O
doubled O
the O
memoryand O
swapped O
to O
a256 O

SSD O
, O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
clocked O
at O
a O

. O

This O
comp O
is O
so O
unreliable O
. O

This O
camera O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
that O
old O
trusted O
companion O
. O

It O
feel O
like O
a O
very O
thin O
layer O
of O

This O
is O
actually O
the O

It O

on O

may O
vary O

both O

that O

I O
say O
( O
my O

geek- O

I O
think O
that O
part O
is O
fine O
for O
a O
1x1 O
system O
, O
but O
it O
could O
not O
hold O

I O
say O
it O

better O
than O

I O
bought O
this O

After O
exhaustive O
troubleshooting O

I O
've O
been O
using O
it O
for O
about O
3 O

4 O
months O
and O
it O
still O
holds O
a O
great O
charge O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
unplugging O
surge O
proctors O
that O
do O
not O
have O
on O

off O

because O
they O
use O
electricity O

when O
you O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
for O

however O
I O
needed O
to O
get O
out O
my O

grind O
around O
the O

Most O
recently O
, O
I O
used O
it O
to O
have O
some O
woman O
tell O
me O
her O
contact O
information O

It O
arrived O
quickly O
and O
was O
in O
great O
shape O
and O
also O
the O
packaging O
was O
great O
. O

The O
Samsang O
might O
have O
a O
more O
logical O
layout O
but O
this O
MSI O
just O
need O
a O
little O
get O
use O
to O
and O
did O
n't O
post O
any O
problem O
for O
me O
. O

I O
've O
had O
others O
that O
felt O
more O
stable O
and O
made O
a O
better O
connection O
, O
others O
that O
have O
had O
features O
like O
an O
extra O
drive O
bay O
, O
those O
are O
what O
keeps O
this O
from O
being O
5 O
star O
. O

They O
also O
have O
inferior O
build O
quality O
( O
in O
my O
opinion O
) O
and O
no O
support O
( O
all O
of O
the O
good O
stuff O
you O
have O
heard O
about O
Apple O
's O
phenomenal O
support O
is O
true O
) O
. O

Same O
exact O
thing O
happened O
after O
just O
a O
couple O
months O
of O
use O
. O

Now O
I O
changed O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
wanted O
a O
backpack O
... O

This O
mini O
- O
surge O
protector O
with O
USB O
charger O
is O
a O
great O
travel O
companion O
. O

A O
great O
price O
for O
25 O
feet O
and O
the O
quality O
did O
not O
suffer O
whatsoever O
. O

Upgrading O
the O
memory O
to O
4Gb O
was O
a O
minimum O
requirement O
, O
so O
after O
some O
research O
to O
determine O
the O
correct O
RAM O
specs O
I O
purchased O
these O
soDIMMs O
. O

Rather O
than O
sit O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
Apple O
operators O
or O
run O
around O
the O
country O
to O
authorized O
repair O
stations O
, O
I O
've O
found O
that O
it O
can O
be O
preferable O
to O
return O
or O
exchange O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O
QQ O
- O
Tech O
adapters O
as O
replacements O
after O
an O
Alfa O
adapter O
I O
'd O
had O
for O
less O
than O
a O
year O
gave O
up O
the O
ghost O
. O

The O
other O
compartment O
has O
a O
zippered O
pouch O
which O
includes O
the O
removable O
rechargeable O
battery O
and O
pockets O
to O
hold O
an O
iPhone O
or O
iPod O
as O
well O
as O
a O
larger O
pocket O
for O
an O
iPad O
with O
a O
velcro O
closure O
with O
a O
hole O
in O
it O
to O
allow O
hookup O
for O
charging O
in O
the O
pocket O
. O

I O
tried O
the O
10 O
port O
one O
- O
BAD O
, O
STAY O
AWAY O
FROM O
- O
did O
NOT O
work O
AT O
ALL O
, O
not O
even O
1 O
port O
. O

Snapping O
it O
on O
and O
off O
is O
a O
breeze O
and O
he O
is O
constantly O
doing O
this O
to O
check O
it O
when O
he O
accidentally O
bumps O
into O
a O
wall O
, O
door O
frame O
, O
etc O
... O

After O
owning O
this O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
it O
started O
going O
bad O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
buying O
another O
brand O
of O
product O
. O

I O
teach O
information O
technology O
. O

Great O
value O
with O
no O
downsides O
and O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
keyboard O
skin O
was O
just O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
. O

so O
far O
the O
new O
replacement O
works O
great O
. O

To O
initialize O
, O
you O
have O
to O
go O
to O
disk O
management O
. O

i. O
e. O
, O
becomes O
ingrained O
) O
. O

It O
works O
, O
it O
feels O
well O
built O
and O
the O
micro O
usb O
connector O
works O
great O
on O
my O
old O
Nexus O
One O
phone O
that O
is O
very O
finicky O
. O

Then O
read O
a O
number O
of O
reviews O
explaining O
this O
problem O
. O

Wanted O
to O
use O
this O
in O
a O
desk O
top O
with O
Vista O
in O
the O
same O
room O
. O

And O
I O
can O
easily O
check O
the O
clean O
clone O
that O
I O
have O
made O
. O

I O
actually O
use O
this O
item O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
. O

Also O
, O
as O
with O
the O
thirty O
dollar O
Amazon O
bag O
, O
this O
one O
lacks O
a O
side O
mesh O
pocket O
, O
meaning O
there O
's O
no O
safe O
way O
to O
carry O
a O
potentially O
drippy O
water O
bottle O
with O
this O
bag O
. O

It O
's O
like O
they O
removed O
everything O
that O
made O
the O
prior O
versions O
convenient O
and O
rearranged O
everything O
that O
was O
left O
to O
make O
it O
as O
inconvenient O
and O
convoluted O
as O
possible O
. O

Just O
feeling O
the O
amount O
of O
padding O
with O
your O
fingers O
confirms O
this O
. O

i O
called O
belkin O
tech O
support O
and O
they O
insisted O
that O
it O
should O
work O
fine O
with O
220V. O

Battery O
life O
? O

It O
does O
n't O
hold O
my O
laptop O
up O
like O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
. O

; O
hard O
drive O
can O
deliver O
; O
not O
sure O
the O
same O
could O
be O
said O
if O
using O
a O
good O
SSD O
rather O
than O
HDD O
. O

The O
screen O
sits O
up O
well O
on O
the O
stand O
and O
stays O
put O
! O

The O
IOUSBFamily O
is O
having O
trouble O
enumerating O
a O
USB O
device O
that O
has O
been O
plugged O
in O
. O

I O
got O
my O
WPDN O
ready O
and O
put O
it O
in O
the O
case O
. O

Woks O
great O
and O
the O
price O
was O
right O
. O

This O
item O
is O
well O
designed O
, O
only O
fabricated O
with O
poor O
quality O
materials O
. O

So O
what O
is O
all O
the O
fuss O
about O
this O
case O
being O
security O
friendly O
? O

Anyway O
, O
the O
new O
piece O
arrived O
with O
the O
problem O
fixed O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
too O
loose O
on O
the O
MBA O
, O
so O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
original O
that O
I O
received O
and O
shaved O
off O
the O
part O
that O
holds O
the O
cover O
onto O
the O
vent O
and O
voila O
! O

Wow O
, O
and O
it O
's O
an O
inch O
thick O
? O

It O
works O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
some O
reviews O
. O

I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
and O
upgraded O
the O
memory O
using O
Kingston O
Memory O
( O
2 O
GB O
800MHZ O
DDR2 O
Sodimm O
- O
KVR800D2S6/2 O
G O
) O
. O

As O
cheap O
as O
it O
is O
, O
I O
'm O
pleased O
it O
's O
still O
working O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
others O
including O
Logitech O
which O
did O
not O
connect O
but O
this O
is O
wonderful O
. O

Its O
performance O
and O
value O
are O
off O
the O
charts O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
disingenuous O
to O
penalize O
it O
for O
the O
minor O
" O
wish O
list O
" O
we O
could O
draw O
up O
. O

( O
3 O
. O
4GHz O
turbo O
mode O
) O
. O

Would O
have O
been O
better O
to O
have O
a O
more O
useful O
pocket O
. O

It O
has O
an O
amazing O
feel O
and O
look O
that O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
find O
elsewhere O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
gets O
tiring O
lugging O
an O
3 O
. O
5 O
mm O
audio O
cable O
around O
, O
plus O
if O
you O
happen O
to O
misplace O
the O
cable O
, O
the O
only O
option O
is O
to O
buy O
another O
one O
or O
use O
the O
very O
short O
3 O
- O
4inch O
cable O
that O
's O
attached O
to O
the O
unit O
. O

it O
is O
always O
connected O
to O
the O
USB O
... O
now O
my O
USB O
port O
is O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
laptop O
... O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
'm O
giving O
it O
two O
stars O
instead O
of O
one O
is O
that O
, O
being O
a O
good O
empirical O
engineer O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
tried O
it O
myself O
. O

After O
listening O
to O
this O
little O
Rokono O
, O
it O
was O
immediately O
obvious O
just O
how O
flat O
and O
empty O
the O
Nook O
's O
speaker O
system O
is.(One O
important O
note O
: O
I O
found O
that O
I O
had O
to O
use O
the O
most O
robust O
EQ O
available O
in O
the O
Nook O

People O
always O
ask O
me O
why O
these O
speakers O
sound O
so O
nice O
when O
they O
come O
close O
by O
my O
desk O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

The O
box O
arrived O
on O
time O
in O
good O
shape O
and O
weighed O
twice O
what O
i O
expected O
. O

I O
normally O
do O
n't O
care O
for O
angled O
ports O
like O
this O
because O
it O
creates O
a O
more O
visible O
mass O
once O
you O
plug O
4 O
devices O
into O
it O

And O
its O
too O
long O
so O
there O
is O
a O
gap O
between O
my O
nexus O
and O
the O
plastic O
part O
of O
the O
cable O
. O

They O
are O
now O
getting O
real O
hard O
to O
find O
because O
they O
are O
last O
years O
model O
, O
and O
the O
model O
that O
replaces O
it O
is O
a O
complete O
piece O
of O
doggy O
doo O
. O

Good O
Luck O
! O

It O
worked O
okay O
at O
first O
, O
a O
bit O
slow O
transferring O
. O

But O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
fantastic O
as O
a O
carry O
- O
on O
for O
plane O
flights O
. O

Has O
a O
nice O
blue O
light O
on O
the O
plug O

Good O
replacement O
for O
the O
feet O
I O
lost O
. O

After O
charging O
it O
fully O
, O
I O
tried O
it O
out O
and O
found O
I O
could O
get O
roughly O
4 O
hours O
of O
computing O
time O
( O
low O
level O

As O
with O
others O
, O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
use O
on O
the O
card O
, O
it O
just O
died O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
sleeve O
can O
protect O
my O
macbook O
pro13 O
' O
if O
it O
drops O
! O
! O
! O

It O
reaches O
our O
entire O
house O
with O
doors O
closed O
, O
up O
and O
down O
two O
stories O
, O
which O
the O
Linksys O
did O
not O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
adapter O
for O
a O
Dell O
700 O
m O
. O

This O
stylish O
case O
is O
visually O
attractive O
and O
very O
well O
made O
( O
great O
stitching O
job O
and O
quality O
materials O
) O
. O

That O
one O
scratched O
the O
bottom O
of O
my O
computer O
. O

I O
keep O
both O
my O
computer O
screens O
, O
as O
well O
as O
my O
flat O
screen O
tv O
relatively O
clean O
all O
of O
the O
time O
, O
so O
when O
I O
tried O
using O
this O
iEraser O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
see O
that O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
, O
but O
one O
thing O
I O
do O
like O
is O
that O
this O
is O
reusable O
, O
which O
up O
until O
this O
point O
I O
have O
been O
using O
either O
microfiber O
cloths O
, O
or O
duster O
cloths O
with O
an O
electronics O
spray O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
like O
the O
light O
. O

Hard O
to O
imagina O
a O
better O
replacement O
battery O
at O
a O
lower O
price O
. O

So O
I O
already O
had O
some O
respect O
for O
the O
brand O
. O

The O
shield O
began O
to O
look O
better O
and O
better O
over O
two O
days O
. O

after O
1 O
week O
i O
had O
enough O
... O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
getting O
into O
PC O
gaming O
, O
then O
you O
will O
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
those O
who O
just O
use O
a O
keyboard O
... O

I O
emailed O
a O
friend O
who O
manages O
the O
MSi O
Tech O
support O
department O
here O
in O

This O
may O
not O
SEEM O
like O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
hot O
laptop O
, O
you O
will O
see O
the O
difference O
! O

I O
've O
been O
carrying O
this O
bag O
every O
day O
for O
nearly O
a O
month O
and O
no O
problem O
with O
threads O
or O
seems O
coming O
loose O
. O

Well O
over O
60fps O
( O
sometimes O
90 O
- O
100fps O
) O
consistently O
. O

I O
did O
not O
buy O
MagicFiber O
because O
I O
was O
unsatisfied O
with O
my O
current O
microfiber O
cloths O
; O
I O
bought O
them O
because O
I O
wanted O
an O
ample O
supply O
of O
cloths O
. O

This O
nifty O
feature O
does O
have O
one O
potential O
design O
flaw O
though O
, O
depending O
on O
your O
preferences O
, O
and O
that O
is O
with O
the O

also O

that O
substantially O

it O
just O

I O
had O

I O

expect O

for O

it O
does O
its O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
smaller O

actually O
I O

It O
's O

put O

it O

there O
is O
an O

once O
I O
plugged O
in O
a O

, O
nothing O

This O
might O
be O
a O

I O

yet O
to O

any O

can O
I O
say O
, O
6 O

later O

the O

I O
order O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
face O
of O

up O
is O
also O
invaluable O
so O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
guess O
if O
you O
found O
a O
live O
outlet O
or O
not O
. O

When O
the O
TV O
is O
off O
, O
the O
reflective O
screen O
is O
bad O
enough O
, O
but O
with O
the O

it O
can O
look O
really O
bad O

I O
'd O
really O
expect O
a O

in O

you O
are O
getting O
a O

it.- O
You O
will O
probably O
want O
to O
disable O
the O

on O
the O

While O
it O
does O
NOT O
look O
like O
the O
one O
in O

it O

not O
one O

ofcourse O
after O

- O
I O
'm O
still O
loving O
this O

There O
are O
ten O
of O
those O
bad O
boys O
, O
and O
that O
's O
just O
on O
the O
outside O
-- O
a O
couple O
more O
are O
hiding O
on O
inside O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O

just O
not O
built O
for O
longevity O

: O
This O
probably O
still O
does O

REALLY O
count O
as O

, O
but O
I O
was O
playing O
Minecraft O
multiplayer O
last O
night O

It O
paired O
like O
a O
dream O
! O

The O
price O
of O
this O

can O
not O
be O
beat O

It O
takes O
some O
time O
to O
be O
fully O
charged O
( O

No O
illuminated O

. O

I O
may O
just O
give O
it O
to O
my O
nieces O
/ O
nephews O
. O

I O
do O
not O
actually O
use O
the O
video O
capabilities O
of O
this O

- O
I O
use O
it O
to O
drive O

for O

only O
. O

I O
've O
accidently O
shut O
off O
my O
wireless O

when O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
quickly O
hit O
the O
back O
key O
. O

Worst O

I O
have O
ever O
used O
, O
and O

The O

does O
not O
have O

delivers O
enough O
power O
to O
produce O
rich O

through O
out O
the O

The O

This O

a O

Installing O

That O
was O
the O
whole O
reason O
of O
buying O
this O
bag O
. O

but O
it O
seems O
suffice O
. O

The O
cords O
were O
exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
after O
losing O

Really O
great O

It O
was O
very O
well O
made O
and O
pretty O

Delivery O
was O
ahead O
of O

, O
packaging O
was O
excellent O
, O
prices O
were O
great O
as O
usual O
with O

I O
got O
this O

a O
Dell O

I O
purchased O
the O

easily O

See O
it O
for O
yourself O
in O
my O

review O
in O
the O

I O
tried O
stressing O
it O
with O
a O
super O
slow O
card O
on O
the O
SD O
card O
port O
and O
it O
still O
booted O
in O
less O
than O
a O
minute O
. O

I O
know O
a O
Corsair O
TX O
750W O
from O
June O
2009 O
that O
is O
still O
going O
strong O
on O
a O
moderately O
loaded O
system O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
internet O
disconnections O
since O
using O
it O
. O

The O
cloth O
holder O
for O
the O
pen O
on O
the O
side O
is O
very O
handy O
, O
and O
sturdy O
. O

The O
Acer O
has O
no O
problem O
handling O
multiple O

No O

no O

in O
charger O
( O
the O
installed O
battery O
can O
be O
charged O
only O
if O
in O
the O
camera O
, O
which O
is O
a O
problem O
if O
you O
're O
using O
it O
at O
the O
time).Another O
minor O
quirk O
is O
that O
when O
you O
download O
the O
videos O
to O
a O
computer O
, O
it O
gives O
them O
filenames O
that O
are O
useless O
and O
too O
long O
. O

I O
used O
the O
HDMI O
jack O
to O
play O
games O
on O
my O
TV O
and O
it O
worked O
well O
. O

but O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
the O
hassle O
to O
return O
it O

Makes O
typing O
fun O
. O

Cords O
are O
excellent O

Check O
the O
Shipping O
charge O
before O
buying O
. O

So O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
features O
. O

, O
It O
seesm O
that O
really O
there O
are O
3 O
ranges O
, O
with O
each O
" O
smart O
tip O
color O
- O
coded O
to O
which O
of O
the O
three O
ranges O
it O
will O
pass O
. O

Just O
for O
the O
record O
, O
I O
still O
have O
my O
20 O
" O
set O
as O
it O
's O
been O
the O
bedroom O
set O
the O
past O
4 O
years O
and O
is O
still O
very O
much O
fine O
. O

Wham O
, O
Bam O
and O
in O
14 O
hours O
it O
was O
closure O
time O
, O
except O
they O
had O
to O
go O
back O
in O
and O
resew O
the O
job O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
after O
reading O
reviews O
on O
amazon O
. O

I O
get O
about O
2 O
hours O
or O
less O
on O
a O
full O
charge O
, O
with O
moderately O
conservative O
settings O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
price O
. O

Screen O
is O
very O
vivid O
and O
has O
great O
colors O
, O
along O
with O
a O
max O
native O
resolution O
of O
1366x768 O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
crash O
, O
there O
is O
no O
connectivity O
. O

That O
follow O
- O
up O
and O
concern O
to O
right O
a O
wrong O
is O
really O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
sellers O
true O
interest O
and O
concern O
to O
satisfy O
the O
customer O
. O

Got O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
OEM O
battery O
that O
failed O
. O

It O
helped O
a O
lot O
. O

But O
as O
much O
as O
I O
battery O
lasts O
4 O
- O
5 O
hours O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
last O
a O
little O
more O
, O
so O
4 O
stars O
. O

This O
was O
where O
the O
magic O
happened O
. O

( O
or O
use O
the O
one O
supplied O
) O

Various O
pockets O
are O
easier O
to O
use O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
amp O
for O
the O
money O
. O

Videos O
will O
not O
run O
. O

it O
feels O
very O
light O
and O
it O
is O
almost O
as O
comfortable O
as O
my O
netbook O
was O
on O
my O
lap O
. O

He O
expressed O
that O
it O
works O
better O
than O
expected O
. O

It O
is O
very O
good O
at O
picking O
up O
wifi O
, O
and O
rarely O
has O
any O
issues O
. O

The O
feel O
does O
not O
bode O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Macbook O
or O
Sony O
's O
touchpad O
but O
is O
sufficient O
( O
I O
use O
a O
mouse O

The O
backlighting O
on O
this O
keyboard O
is O
so O
bright O
at O
minimum O
setting O
, O
that O
if O
you O
are O
using O
it O
in O
dark O
situations O
where O
you O
need O
it O
you O
will O
be O
lighting O
up O
the O
room O
and O
making O
the O
screen O
experience O
terrible O
. O

It O
's O
great O
for O
pulling O
in O
weak O
WiFi O
signals O
. O

Only O
draw O
back O
is O
it O
can O
be O
noisy O
! O

The O
laptop O
case O
was O
flawless O
, O
it O
was O
just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Reads O
great O
on O
my O
computer O
... O

The O
other O
complaint O
is O
the O
enclosed O
screwdriver O
which O
is O
a O
nice O
thought O
but O
is O
too O
small O
to O
be O
of O
any O
practical O
use O
. O

The O
keyboard O
looks O
nice O
enough O
, O
and O
paring O
it O
to O
my O
device O
is O
easy O
. O

And O
obviously O
when O
you O
travel O
internationally O
the O
security O
screening O
is O
much O
more O
detailed O
. O

After O
reading O
reviews O
, O
I O
chose O
this O
light O
and O
it O
's O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
light O
to O
illuminate O

laptop O

and O
you O
'll O
be O
good O
to O
go O
. O

Also O
, O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
have O
an O
HP O

i7 O
, O
8 O

ATI O

, O
and O
a O
hard O
drive O
running O
at O
7 O
, O
200 O
RPMs O
. O

Although O
it O
has O
two O
speeds O
I O
've O
found O
that O
the O
low O
setting O
is O
sufficient O
. O

It O
shuts O
down O
the O
touchpad O
when O
you O
press O
any O
letter O
key O
. O

Very O
well O
made O
and O
designed O
. O

That O
said O
, O
if O
I O
take O
the O
time O
to O
carefully O
select O
which O
lenses O
to O
bring O
along O
( O
I O
usually O
do O
anyways O
) O
, O
I O
usually O
can O
make O
this O
pack O
work O
for O
me O
quite O
well O
about O
75 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
. O

The O
only O
issues O
I O
have O
are:-The O
screen O
is O
HIGH O
GLOSS O
, O
just O
like O
every O
other O
laptop O
made O
today O
, O
I O
spent O
weeks O
looking O
for O
a O
matte O
screen O
, O
and O
the O
only O
people O
making O
them O
are O
Samsung O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
say O
this O
has O
been O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
home O
users O
. O

They O
are O
cheap O
, O
functional O
, O
and O
not O
robustly O
built O
for O
torture O
. O

There O
are O
a O
multitude O
of O
viewing O
positions O
with O
the O
case O
; O
I O
even O
double O
it O
over O
itself O
to O
use O
the O

It O
was O
less O

when O
I O
read O
the O

I O
use O

care O

they O
're O
not O
as O
accurate O

In O
fact O

I O
did O
not O

I O
'll O
elucidate O
later O

That O
should O
be O
listed O
clearly O
in O
the O
description O
or O
technical O
information O
. O

Normally O
buy O
the O
Microsoft O
brand O
wireless O
mouse O
but O
thought O
we O
would O
try O
this O
one O
. O

It O
has O
a O
full O
keyboard O
, O
with O
a O
10-key O
pad O
on O
the O

The O
16 O

the O
best O
value O

on O

I O
thought O
my O
InCase O
bag O
was O
on O
the O
smallish O
side O
but O
the O
pockets O
on O
this O
bag O
are O
far O
from O
generous O
and O
poorly O
designed O
. O

Very O
well O
designed O
, O
lots O
of O
storage O
space O
. O

This O
battery O
does O
not O
very O
last O

It O
will O
fit O
just O
fine O
even O
with O
a O
Smart O
Cover O
and O
Shell O
, O
although O
I O
usually O
just O
toss O
it O
into O
the O
notebook O
sleeve O
in O
my O
pack O
outside O
of O
the O
sleeve O
case O
. O

Easy O
setup O

The O
manual O
focus O
is O
touchy O
but O
works O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
in O
the O
return O
period O

This O
is O
a O
slow O
reader O
. O

Got O
a O
new O
iMac27inch O
, O
did O
the O
smart O
thing O
and O
did O
n't O
order O
additional O

I O
guess O
people O
in O
here O
are O
too O
winny O
or O
something O
... O

It O
actually O
seems O
a O
bit O
faster O
than O
the O
DSL O
hardwired O
connection O
I O
was O
using O
. O

I O
originally O
thought O
the O
pad O
would O
only O
work O
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
but O
even O
when O
the O

is O
doing O

Just O

its O
not O

This O
is O
the O
best O
product O
, O
over O
Apple O
which O
is O
expensive O

GYMLE O
which O
has O
too O
cheap O

it O

Other O
than O
this O
issue O
I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
the O
way O
it O

I O
understand O
the O

factors O
that O
reduce O
battery O
life O

your O

, O

-- O

to O
have O

cut O

is O
completely O
ridiculous O

it O
fits O
perfectly O

Visit O

Toshiba O

those O

I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
price O
and O
the O
purchase O

To O
alleviate O
this O
problem O
, O
ensure O
that O
either O
your O
room O
is O
well O
ventilated O
, O
or O
you O
also O
have O
a O
fan O
directly O
on O
you O
and O
the O

or O
the O
room O
is O
air O

conditioned O

I O
really O
abhor O
track O

. O

I O
am O
pretty O
happy O
with O
this O
TV O
; O
I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
about O
2 O
months O
. O

A O
mute O
button O
would O
have O
been O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

then O
you O
would O
normally O
need O
for O
work O
or O
school O
. O

so O
I O
return O
it O
and O
bought O
this O
one O
. O

but O
literally O
it O
" O
boots O
up O
" O
in O
about O
3 O
seconds O
... O

I O
placed O
a O
couple O
of O
erasers O
under O
the O
back O
corners O
of O
the O
laptop O
and O
that O
works O
great O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O
Crucial O
800mhz O
module O
for O
the O
2 O

upgrade O
. O

I O
love O
this O
little O
speaker O
. O

It O
also O
did O
not O
work O
with O
Microsoft O
's O
bluetooth O
driver O
on O
Vista O
x64 O
. O

Then O
I O
used O
one O
from O
each O
headphone O
one O
each O
ear O
. O

But O
it O
charged O
nonetheless O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

Even O
the O
power O
button O
stopped O
working O
. O

The O
stereo O
is O
a O
great O
touch O
, O
specially O
if O
one O
plays O
a O

with O

an O
accent O
point O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
my O
house O
from O
the O
other O

. O

It O
is O
small O
but O
lets O
be O
honest O
it O
is O
for O
an O
iPad O
mini O
! O
! O

I O
also O
like O
the O
slightly O
raised O
angle O
of O
the O

typing O
. O

i O
can O
watch O
movies O
and O
game O
almost O
4hr O
without O
pluging O
to O
socket O
. O

It O
is O
bright O
and O
has O
dense O
pixels O
. O

Astonishing O
simple O
to O
get O
rolling O
and O
connected O
to O
Windows O
Media O
Center O
. O

It O
works O
perfectly O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

I O
can O
have O
my O
laptop O
anywhere O
and O
have O
this O
drive O
as O
an O
extension O
anywhere O
anytime O
, O
even O
30 O
, O

feet O
in O
the O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
go O
swinging O
the O
bag O
into O
objects O
, O
or O
dropping O
the O
bag O
on O
the O
floor O
with O
the O
laptop O
inside O
, O
then O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
any O
issues O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
find O
anything O
. O

No O
matter O
what O
I O
did O
the O
audio O
was O
hard O
to O
hear O
unless O
you O
cranked O
the O
volume O
, O
and O
even O
then O
there O
was O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
static O
. O

I O
call O
them O
and O
when O
I O
do O
not O
get O
a O
tech O
support O
from O
India O
who O
assures O
me O
that O
nothing O
is O
really O
wrong O
, O
I O
get O
someone O
who O
tells O
me O
it O
is O
a O
software O
problem O
and O
that O
it O
must O
have O
corrupted O
drivers O
. O

I O
hope O
these O
will O
be O
of O
better O
quality O
and O
stand O
the O
test O
of O
time O
. O

If O
this O
thing O
did O
n't O
burn O
my O
eyes O
, O
I O
could O
see O
how O
it O
'd O
be O
a O
wonderful O
case O
: O
perfect O
fit O
, O
great O
stitching O
, O
thin O
, O
tough O
material O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
item O
and O
first O
thing O
I O
notice O
is O
how O
long O
the O
usb O
cable O
is O
. O

I O
was O
inspired O
to O
buy O
this O
keyboard O
when O
I O
discovered O
that O
it O
is O
identical O
to O
one O
I O
purchased O
for O
a O
friend O
and O
liked O
too O
much O
to O
pass O
up O
: O
Wireless O
Bluetooth O
Keyboard O
for O
iPad O
/ O
iPhone O

. O
0 O

I O
did O
not O
purchase O
another O
. O

but O
for O
the O
price O
its O
a O
decent O
value O
. O

I O
listened O
to O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
music O
, O
including O
high O
resolution O
( O
24/96 O
) O
and O
test O
tracks O
, O
including O
those O
provided O
directly O
by O
NuForce O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
out O
our O
iTunes O
collection O
which O
is O
eclectic O
and O
reflects O
our O
diverse O
music O
likes O
. O

I O
have O
the O
console O
positioned O
far O
away O
from O
the O
stereo O
and O
this O
works O
great O
. O

It O
has O
great O
range O
and O
was O
very O
simple O
to O
pair O
with O
my O
Vizio O
Bluetooth O
headphones O
! O
.. O

Mounted O
easily O
and O
quickly O
and O
accepted O
my O
58 O
mm O
filters O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

This O
unit O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
going O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
tape O
it O
to O
my O
laptop O
to O
make O
it O
permanent O
. O

It O
's O
free O
, O
so O
no O
harm O
keeping O
it O
. O

As O
much O
as O
I O
wanted O
these O
media O
players O
to O
work O
they O
were O

The O
nice O
pros O
are O
a O
much O
longer O
all O
in O
one O
cord O
and O
no O
separate O
volume O
switch O
. O

I O
've O
really O
only O
used O
xinpit O
with O
it O
, O
but O
no O
complaints O
! O

What O
really O
sets O
these O
speakers O
apart O
is O
the O
wireless O
connectivity O
. O

All O
of O
my O
bluetooth O
syncs O
very O
easily O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
super O
expansive O
, O
the O
screen O
is O
unbelievable O
( O
more O
on O
that O
later O
) O
and O
you O
can O
still O
stay O
mobile O
with O
this O
thing O
if O
you O
really O
need O
to O
. O

However O
after O
using O
it O
for O
~6 O
hours O
I O
believe O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
the O
machine O
I O
received O
is O
defective O
or O
has O
some O
serious O
software O
issues O
. O

The O
product O
was O
received O
on O
time O
, O
great O
condition O
and O
working O
good O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
compared O
all O
of O
my O
H264 O
videos O
with O
all O
of O
my O
WebM O
videos O
and O
the O
WebM O
videos O
played O
back O
flawlessly O
on O
both O
the O
Chromebook O
and O
Windows O
7 O
PC O
, O
but O
the O
H264 O
videos O
had O
very O
minor O
playback O
issues O
like O
ever O
- O
slight O
shading O
or O
discoloration O
and O
syncing O
of O
audio O
or O
an O
occasional O
stutter O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
pretty O
awkward O
to O
use O
in O
public O
or O
at O
work O
. O

you O

just O
fine O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
all O
this O
, O
I O
also O
lost O
my O
battery O
. O

Eventually O
I O
settled O
on O
this O
one O
. O

This O
netbook O
comes O
with O
" O
MS O
Office O
Starter O
" O
which O
includes O
basic O
versions O
of O
Word O
and O
Excel O
; O
these O
are O
not O
trial O
versions O
, O
but O
permanent O
programs O
that O
include O
a O
space O
for O
advertising O
( O
some O
Windows O
product O
) O
in O
the O
program O
window O
. O

Ca O
n't O
say O
much O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
as O
an O
error O
, O
never O
received O
the O
computer O
, O
my O
order O
was O
refunded O
, O
so O
look O
at O
another O
review O
, O
I O
will O
say O
though O
, O
for O
this O
year O
, O
the O
specs O
look O
good O
enough O
to O
justify O
buying O
this O
computer O
. O

As O
for O
the O
negatives O
: O
You O
will O
get O
small O
scratches O
on O
this O
machine O
that O
appear O
as O
slightly O
darker O
gray O
than O
the O
aluminum O
itself O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
I O
just O
remove O
what O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
. O

After O
testing O
I O
found O
the O
temperature O
display O
is O
just O
as O
inaccurate O
as O
the O
one O
I O
returned O
. O

Did O
contact O
customer O

one O
of O
the O

n't O
seem O

I O

with O

from O

but O
this O

is O
just O
awesome O
and O
it O
was O
worth O
paying O
a O
little O
more O
to O
experience O
the O
difference O

Everything O
can O
be O
carried O
in O
an O

it O
hooked O

I O
have O
this O
plugged O
into O
a O

into O

what O

The O
clover O

processor O
on O
this O
thing O
really O
is O
more O
powerful O
than O
most O
people O
think O
. O

Does O
n't O
feel O
quite O
as O
sturdy O
though O
, O

It O
's O
also O
right O
on O
top O
of O
the O
Cruzer O
and O
since O
my O
options O
for O
where O
I O
plug O
it O
into O
my O
laptop O
are O
limited O

Now O
I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
homework O
on O
this O
speaker O
system O
before O
I O
took O
the O
plunge O
and O
A O
LOT O
of O
people O
seem O
to O
really O
like O
this O
system O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
unit O
requires O
two O
USB O
ports O
, O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
them O
available O
, O
or O
buy O
one O
of O
the O
small O
inexpensive O
USB O
hubs O
which O
abound O
on O
this O
site O
:) O

Well O
, O
if O
when O
you O
fold O
the O
cord O
up O
you O
create O
tension O
when O
the O
permanently O
affixed O
cord O
attaches O
, O
it O
will O
soon O
break O
through O
to O
bare O
wire O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
my O
two O
big O
monitors O
at O
work O
. O

The O
HP O
showed O
no O
improvement O
in O
the O
signal O
that O
it O
received O
. O

adapter O
defintely O
adds O
speed O
to O
USB O
3 O
devices O
. O

Sure O
enough O
- O
they O
also O
report O
unintended O
double O
- O
clicking O
. O

so O
I O
bought O
the O
official O
charger O
, O
it O
still O
takes O
many O
hours O
to O
finish O
charging O
. O

MBA O

Amazon O

I O
'll O
just O
swap O
the O
old O
one O
back O
in O
before O
I O
ship O
if O
off O

The O
unit O
allows O
me O
to O
swivel O
the O
outlets O
at O
any O
90 O
degree O
angle O
which O
is O
another O
plus O
. O

When O
purchasing O
this O
mouse O
, O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
it O
was O
so O
small O
. O

The O
software O
could O
use O
a O
bit O
of O
improvement O
-- O
as O
long O
as O
it O
's O
working O
, O
it O
works O
great O
, O
but O
when O
something O
goes O
wrong O
, O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
fix O
. O

. O
1 O
" O
netbook O
just O
fine O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
room O
to O
spare O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
put O
any O
accessories O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
it O
is O
a O
quick O
and O
easy O
fix O
. O

I O
did O
not O
see O
any O
difference O
, O
it O
actually O
slowed O
down O
than O
my O
oem O
4 O
gb O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
item O
. O

It O
not O
only O
works O
perfectly O

My O
laptop O
would O
overheat O
and O
shut O
itself O
down O
within O
a O
matter O
of O
minutes O
of O
turning O
it O
on O
. O

They O
're O
actually O
standard O
size O
for O
an O
ultrabook O
. O

Nothing O
has O
torn O
, O
nothing O
has O
ripped O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
I O
always O
feel O
that O
pros O
and O
cons O
are O
the O
most O
informative O
when O
considering O
a O
purchase O
, O
so O
here O
goes O
.... O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
plan O
to O
! O

So O
a O
comment O
related O
to O
the O
" O
Retail O
kit O
" O
vs O
the O
OEM O
version O
. O

Click O
the O
Scheme O
Options O
button O
and O
name O
the O
scheme O
MOVIES O
or O
the O
like O
. O

It O
's O
never O
going O
to O
happen O
unfortunately O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
good O
, O
but O
quality O
suffers O
if O
listening O
while O
charging O
. O

The O
only O
negatives O
about O
this O
system O
is O
the O
woefully O
too O
short O
connecting O
cables O
for O
the O
satellite O
speakers O
, O
that O
it O
defaults O
to O
Bluetooth O
when O
the O
power O
is O
cycled O
and O
that O
most O
of O
the O
controls O
are O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
sub O
. O
. O

I O
know O
it O
'll O
continue O
to O
work O
until O
I O
'm O
ready O
to O
retire O
it O
altogether O
when O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
becomes O
common O
place O
. O

It O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
cases O
, O
and O
fits O
well O
. O

The O
top O
compartment O
is O
relatively O
spacious O
and O
has O
internal O
compartments O
and O
slots O
for O
accessories O
, O
cables O
, O
etc O
. O

the O
keyboard O
is O
nice O
but O
ca O
nt O
use O
it O
cuz O
the O
ipad O
wo O
nt O
stay O
in O

8 O
lens O
a O
clip O
on O
type O
and O
not O
screw O
on O
hood O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
will O
serve O
you O
very O
well O
for O
years O
to O
come O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
game O
or O
do O
video O
processing O
or O
lots O
of O
image O
processing O
, O
you O
should O
spring O
for O
a O
better O
processor O
. O

I O
got O
this O
because O
the O
laptop O
stock O
boots O
in O
about O
55 O
- O
70 O
seconds O
. O

No O
biggie O
as O
the O
keyboard O
works O
great O
without O
this O
feature O
. O

Got O
for O
my O
better O
half O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
. O

so O
you O
can O
put O
it O
on O
your O
roll O
- O
aboard O
suitcase O
. O

i O
pop O
them O
and O
my O
dog O
goes O
bonkers O
! O

Looks O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
the O
10 O
bucks O
I O
spent O
. O

Super O
easy O
setup O
, O
very O
light O
, O
small O
footprint O
( O
great O
if O
you O
do O
not O
have O
much O
room O
on O
your O
desk O
) O
and O
a O
great O
price O
. O

It O
's O
compact O
, O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
provides O
a O
fast O
connection O
. O

The O
only O
caveat O
is O
the O
edge O
: O
some O
edges O
are O
a O
bit O
sharper O
than O
others O
, O
so O
people O
with O
delicate O
hands O
might O
complain O
about O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
' O
Book O
in O
front O
of O
the O
track O
pad O
. O

so O
i O
did O
n't O
care O
to O
bring O
it O
back O
and O
return O
it O
( O
would O
have O
cost O
me O
more O
than O
case O
) O

Side O
mesh O
pocket O
is O
meant O
for O
a O
tripod O
. O

The O
speakers O
on O
the O
laptop O
do O
get O
loud O
without O
too O
much O
distortion O
, O
and O
they O
work O
really O
well O
while O
watching O
TV O
shows O
and O
what O
not O
where O
it O
's O
mainly O
just O
people O
speaking O
. O

Ordered O
5 O
this O
after O
I O
order O
15 O
ft O
cable O
which O
failed O
after O
the O
1st O
month O
. O

For O
music O
, O
I O
have O
iTunes O
on O
the O
hard O
drive O
and O
use O
the O
Music O
app O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
Tablet O
mode O
. O

My O
first O
was O
a O
very O
low O
budget O
tablet O
, O
the O
Archos O
7 O
Home O
Tablet O
, O
the O
second O
was O
the O
Archos O
70 O
Internet O
Tablet O
. O

Whereas O
I O
preciously O
could O
not O
even O
go O
to O
the O
couch O
, O
this O
adapter O
lets O
me O
go O
all O
around O
the O
apartment O
. O

I O
can O
consider O
I O
have O
all O
these O
services O
run O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O
, O
it O
could O
still O
be O
used O
... O
if O
I O
held O
it O
together O
with O
one O
hand O
and O
typed O
with O
the O
other O
. O

Ca O
n't O
unhook O
the O
strap O
to O
change O
it O
into O
a O
briefcase O
- O
only O
style O
bag O
. O

This O
battery O
works O
as O
advertised O
in O
our O
16 O
in O
. O

Still O
, O
it O
kind O
of O
cheapens O
the O
product O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

TSA O
approved O
really O
depends O
on O
the O
security O
personnel O
if O
they O
will O
have O
you O
remove O
the O
laptop O
from O
the O
bag O
or O
not O
. O

I O
have O
a O
15 O
" O
screen O
laptop O
and O
this O
product O
seems O
to O
be O
just O
the O
right O
size O
. O

This O
fits O
well O
. O

My O
only O
" O
gripe O
" O
is O
that O
it O
does O
nt O
travel O
well O

The O
screen O
is O
bright O
and O
visibility O
is O
very O
good O
. O

Is O
okay O
, O
I O
like O
the O
rubberized O
flap O
cover O
, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
the O
hard O
case O
cover O

The O
battery O
in O
the O
keyboard O
stays O
charged O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Great O
bag O
. O

This O
setup O
give O
me O
the O
best O
of O
all O
possibilities O
as O
I O
am O
able O
to O
access O
either O
drive O
with O
one O
housing O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
. O

iTunes O
has O
a O
way O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
on O
another O
computer O
on O
the O
same O
network O
without O
transferring O
the O
files O
. O

The O
biggest O
downside O
is O
how O
flimsy O
the O
headset O
is O
. O

Almost O
bought O
a O
new O
$ O
1000 O
printer O
( O
business O
) O
until O
I O
try O
spending O
$ O
5 O
on O
a O
better O
cable O
. O

but O
not O
the O
filter O
's O
fault O

The O
kick O
stand O
on O
the O
battery O
cover O
broke O
off O
2 O
weeks O
after O
getting O
it O
. O

( O
maybe O
I O
'm O
not O
yet O
used O
to O
it O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
comfortable O

, O

are O
also O
a O
bit O
too O
hard O

( O
I O
personally O
wo O
n't O
use O

, O
maybe O
they O
could O

picture O
quality O
is O
about O
as O
good O
as O
the O
best O
VHS O

I O
have O
used O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
even O
need O
drivers O

Honestly O
if O
your O
PC O
( O

or O
desktop O
) O
do O
nt O
have O
a O

I O
think O

is O
useless O
. O

The O
first O
accessory O
that O
I O
bought O
when O
I O
got O
my O
first O
laptop O
was O
a O
infrared O
mouse O
. O

Someone O
purchases O
a O
piece O
of O
technology O
like O
this O
. O

The O
box O
it O
came O
in O
actually O
came O
with O
a O
list O
of O
suggestions O
to O
reuse O
the O
box O
( O
one O
suggestion O
was O
to O
use O
it O
as O
gift O
box O
) O

Very O
light O
, O
only O
4lbs O
. O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
as O
it O
can O
slide O
off O
a O
surface O
, O
I O
bought O
a O
1yrAccidental O
Damage O
and O
hardware O
support O
warranty O
from O
HP O
, O
in O
case O
of O
a O
drop O

a O

You O
can O
purchase O
a O
Sonos O
remote O
or O
download O
a O
free O
iPod O

or O
iPhone O
/ O
iPad O
application O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
control O
what O
music O
is O
listened O
to O
. O

I O
have O
read O
other O
reviews O
, O
and O
some O
said O
that O
the O
pen O
nib O
wore O
down O
fairly O
fast O
, O
but O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
evidence O
of O
this O
. O

Cons O

no O

For O
reference O
I O
had O
WiFi O
on O
, O
Bluetooth O
off O
, O
screen O
brightness O
was O
at O
8 O
bars O
( O
50 O

and O

was O
at O
12 O
bars O
( O
75 O

) O
. O

Recharged O
overnight O
and O
tried O
again O
the O
next O
day O
, O
same O
result O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
shut O
it O
down O
and O
went O
into O
troubleshooting O
mode O
. O

These O
perform O
without O
heat O
problems O
, O
and O
used O
under O
both O
Windows O
and O

. O

A O
bonus O
is O
its O
water O
resistance O
; O
found O
out O
by O
accident O
when O
I O
accidentally O
spilled O
part O
of O
my O
drink O
on O
an O
iPad O
wrapped O
in O
the O
16 O
" O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
good O
to O
have O
extra O
battery O
. O

If O
your O
jogging O
with O
your O
iPod O
, O
you O
are O
expecting O
too O
much O
for O

and O
that O

where O
the O

You O

do O
what O
you O
got O
ta O
do O
to O
keep O
your O
expensive O

clean O
though O
, O
right O
? O

It O
should O
be O
understood O
that O
this O

Windows O

more O

Most O
of O
the O
User O

, O
have O
it O
straight O

when O
they O
claim O
approx O
. O

The O
price O
is O
right O
as O
well O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
keyboard O
dock O
made O
more O
sense O
to O
me O
. O

This O
is O
good O
because O
it O
keeps O
Windows O
segregated O
from O
messing O
with O
your O
Mac O
and O
you O
can O
play O
your O
favorite O
game O
( O
mine O
is O
SolSuite O
) O
or O
application O
from O
your O
PC O
that O
you O
just O
ca O
n't O
give O
up O
. O

Yes O
it O
is O
a O
gloss O
finish O
and O
you O
do O
get O
some O
reflections O
here O
or O
there O
, O

This O
inverter O
can O
run O
my O

The O
screens O
on O
the O
other O

I O
was O
looking O
at O
looked O
good O
, O
but O
the O
screen O
on O
the O
Toshiba O
had O
considerably O
better O
colors O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
either O
of O
these O
cases O
. O

I O
purchase O
this O
when O
it O
can O
be O
found O
under O
$ O
20 O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
investment O
for O
that O

This O
could O
easily O

This O
is O
an O
excellent O
laptop O
at O
an O
incredible O
price O
. O

Very O
nice O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
about O
it O
. O

This O
worked O
perfectly O
! O

Apparently O
, O
X O
- O
Rite O
decided O
a O
generic O
installation O
guide O
with O
pictures O
and O
multi O
- O
platform O
installation O
steps O
would O
suffice O
. O

It O
cleaned O
my O
monitor O
screen O
just O
fine O
without O
any O
streaks O
or O
residue O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
senior O
in O
college O
and O
my O
trusty O
bag O
since O
day O
one O
finally O
let O
me O
down O
, O
but O
only O
because O
I O
got O
a O
bigger O
laptop O
. O

I O
tested O
all O
my O
usb O
drivers O
on O
the O
Card O
and O
all O
of O
them O
works O
very O
well O
and O
very O
fast O
. O

They O
fit O
my O
Hitachi O
and O
Seagate O
laptop O
HDDs O

Ultra O
( O
not O
the O
Samsung O
Slim O
) O
. O

Much O
smaller O
than O
advertised O
, O
easily O
1 O
or O
2 O
inches O
smaller O
than O
the O
Nook O
all O
the O
way O
around O
. O

All O
the O
major O
buttons O
are O
not O
covered O
and O
can O
be O
accessed O
using O
the O
case O
. O

There O
's O
some O
vignetting O
at O
full O
zoom O
out O
, O
to O
correct O
it O

The O
wireless O
capability O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
stuttering O
, O
delays O
or O
repeating O
characters O
. O

so O
I O
chose O
this O
one O
after O
reading O
reviews O

I O
primarily O
use O
them O
for O
working O
out O
. O

I O
was O
planning O
on O
using O
this O
as O
my O
bag O
to O
take O
with O
me O
to O
classes O
this O
semester O
, O
I O
have O
4 O
classes O
a O
day O
, O
and O
they O
're O
pretty O
much O
back O
to O
back O
, O
( O
i. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
wait O
time O
is O
fast O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

I O
took O
them O
out O
, O
switched O
them O
, O
and O
tried O
it O
again O
and O
it O
worked O
! O

I O
was O
hoping O
this O
would O
be O
a O
good O
answer O
for O
me O
to O
charge O
my O
mophie O
juice O
pack O
for O
my O
iphone O
4s O

Save O
the O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
quality O
aftermarket O
product O
like O
this O
with O
new O
cells O
. O

With O
heavy O
use O
, O
the O
fan O
wo O
n't O
come O
on O
full O
speed O
until O
about O
20 O
minutes O
into O
using O
it O
. O

The O
notebook O
compartiment O
should O
not O
contain O
any O
accessory O
pockets O
to O
avoid O
risk O
of O
scratching O
the O
computer O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
most O
of O
my O
software O
is O
on O
CD O
/ O
DVD O
. O

Use O
it O
primarily O
for O
Skype O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
:) O

Good O
choices O
with O
both O
- O
using O
the O
laptop O
like O
it O
was O
new O
again O
. O

I O
bought O
two O
of O
these O
and O
both O
of O
them O
work O
as O
promised O
. O

We O
did O

I O
am O

Poor O
design O
choice O
. O

My O
main O
issue O
with O
this O
case O
, O
though O
, O
is O
its O
fit O
. O

There O
is O
one O
large O
outer O
pocket O
that O
is O
open O
on O
top O
, O
tied O
down O
with O
straps O
, O
that O
is O
useful O
if O
you O
want O
to O
place O
something O
within O
easy O
access O
. O

The O
very O
cool O
color O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
aunt O
and O
used O
it O
for O
a O
while O
before O
ultimately O
giving O
it O
to O
her O
( O
as O
a O
computer O
enthusiast O
, O
gamer O
, O
and O
programmer O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
was O
as O
good O
as O
it O
seemed O
) O
, O
and O
it O
definitely O
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

You O
just O
can O
not O
push O
it O
all O
the O
way O
down O
. O

So O
for O
all O
that O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
slowww O
speed O
into O
account O
, O
there O
are O
many O
file O
types O
you O
can O
not O
access O
at O
all O
( O
the O
folders O
they O
are O
in O
do O
not O
display O
them).The O
last O
straw O
for O
me O
, O
before O
returning O
the O
unit O
, O
was O
trying O
to O
login O
to O
Mionet O
to O
establish O
the O
network O
connection O
, O
and O
finding O
myself O
unable O
to O
do O
so O
, O
with O
an O
error O
message O
stating O
that O
there O
was O
" O
something O
" O
wrong O
with O
my O
network O
connections O
. O

This O
could O
be O
a O
problem O
between O
levels O
but O
not O
between O
walls O
. O

Nice O
quality O
.. O
worked O
perfectly O
and O
great O
price O
! O

It O
would O
not O
work O
with O
the O
Kindle O
Fire O
, O
my O
ipod O
, O
nor O
my O
iphone O
. O

The O
size O
is O
just O
right O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
product O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
work O
in O
progress O
. O

I O
had O
purchased O
another O
case O
which O
I O
've O
since O
returned O
( O
no O
problems O
here O
) O

Very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
this O
laptop O
. O

This O
new O
battery O
has O
more O
than O
tripled O
that O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
use O
with O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
different O
charger O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
either O

I O
really O
needed O
a O
replacement O
and O
this O
one O
was O
terrific O
! O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
best O
computer O
- O
related O
purchases O
. O

Actually O
I O
bought O
this O
to O
help O
cool O
my O
compact O
desktop O
. O

The O
design O
with O
little O
pockets O
lacks O
the O
oversight O
that O

so O
it O
's O
seems O
to O
not O
be O
not O
a O
driver O
or O
hardware O
issue O
. O

the O
cd O
drivers O
worked O
until O
8 O
. O

It O
has O
a O
high O
- O
qual O
screen O
resolution O
, O
skype O
is O
cool O
on O
both O
audio O
and O
video O
, O
thankfully O
it O
does O
n't O
crash O
when O
there O
are O
too O
many O
tasks O
at O
hand O
, O
unlike O
the O
Toshi O
I O
had O
. O

plus O
it O
is O
keeping O
the O
dust O
out O
and O
dog O
fur O
. O

It O
did O
take O
me O
a O
while O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
turn O
the O
speaker O
on O
( O
did O
n't O
bother O
reading O
the O
instructions O
) O
but O
all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
hold O
the O
power O
button O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
seconds O
and O
on O
it O
goes O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
all O
this O
functionality O
comes O
with O
a O
price O
and O
in O
this O
case O
is O
comes O
in O
the O
form O
of O
weight O
. O

Please O
note O
( O
again O
) O
that O
upgrading O
both O
the O
RAM O
and O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
exceptionally O
easy O
with O
this O
laptop O
since O
there O
's O
only O
one O
screw O
to O
the O
whole O
door O
which O
covers O
both O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
" O
4 O
. O
5 O
" O
and O
not O
docking O
a O
point O
is O
because O
for O
most O
people O
this O
case O
would O
be O
perfect O
, O
something O
to O
protect O
the O
kindle O
while O
in O
your O
bag O
or O
backpack O
where O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
shaken O
around O
to O
much O
. O

so O
I O
knew O
she O
did O
n't O
need O
anything O
too O
robust O
. O

( O
After O
doing O
research O
, O
found O
out O
this O
was O
a O
known O
dud O
of O
a O
laptop O
with O
a O
high O
incidence O
of O
Motherboard O
failure O
) O
. O

Not O
very O
useful O
, O
it O
was O
too O
big O
when O
plugging O
a O
decent O
headphone O
port O
. O

It O
looks O
cool O
, O
runs O
great O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
very O
simple O
to O
maintain O
and O
did O
I O
mention O
it O
saves O
A O
LOT O
of O
space O
! O

It O
works O
on O
Mac O
Keynote O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
fine O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
good O
, O
and O
it O
is O
built O
very O
well O
. O

This O
a O
great O
product O
and O
will O
look O
great O

A O
kind O
soul O
just O
posted O
a O
WindowsXP O
solution O
as O
well O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
any O
protection O
inside O
and O
looks O
cheap O
. O

Larger O
fan O
would O
draw O
more O
air O
and O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
quiet O
. O

This O
was O
useful O
for O
several O
reasons O
because O
it O
has O
a O
short O
cord O
, O
has O
a O
nice O
solid O
connection O
between O
my O
devices O
and O
finally O
I O
like O
that O
it O
has O
a O
90 O
degree O
bend O
for O
the O
Micro O
USB O
to O
wrap O
the O
cord O
in O
a O
better O
position O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
charger O
for O
my O
customer O
more O
than O
one O
year O
ago O
. O

No O
pain O
pulling O
the O
Aspire O
1 O
out O
of O
it O
and O
no O
awkward O
dealings O
associated O
with O
the O
gel O
ones O
. O

Not O
sure O
what O
the O
original O
mac O
power O
cord O
looked O
like O
, O
but O
this O
looks O
genuine O
, O
and O
works O
perfect O
. O

The O
Logitech O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
more O
expensive O
, O
but O
not O
that O
much O
, O
has O
one O
fan O

I O
have O
to O
work O

, O
I O
need O
enough O
battery O
juice O
for O
longer O
than O
a O
2hr O
trip O
, O
so O
I O
was O
always O
trying O
to O
conserve O
battery O
life O
and O
ended O
up O
with O
no O
power O
for O
my O
laptop O
until O
I O
get O
to O
a O

I O
'm O

and O
I O
've O
had O
no O

I O
suspect O
you O
'd O
be O
less O
fortunate O
if O
you O
dropped O
it O

a O

I O
have O
to O

is O
very O
fast O

Comes O
with O
a O

your O

I O
plugged O
this O
into O
a O
Windows O

The O
external O
side O

was O
too O
small O
to O

The O
iPad O
, O

and O
laptop O
slots O
have O
a O
very O
soft O
material O
inside O
so O
as O
not O
to O
scratch O
the O
screens O

While O
the O
speakers O
are O
good O
, O
they O
are O
n't O
quite O
up O
to O

of O
the O

found O
in O

There O

When O
I O
initially O
began O
my O
search O
for O
a O
decent O

for O
an O
affordable O

, O
the O
Kinobo O

was O
one O

up O

I O
received O

am O
quite O
pleased O
. O

Moreover O
it O
came O
with O
complementary O

which O
is O
great O
for O

This O

What O
we O

though O

So O
when O
I O
travel O
, O
I O
will O
probably O
just O
carry O
four O
six O

in O
my O

to O
set O
the O

on O

which O
is O
surprisingly O

rather O
than O
this O
bulky O

, O
and O
just O
save O
the O

for O
use O
at O
home O

But O
, O
I O
'll O
chalk O
it O
up O
as O
a O
pro O
because O
I O
'll O
get O
used O
to O
it O

An O
item O
that O
does O
exactly O
what O
it O
says O
, O
that O
's O
the O

but O
I O
honestly O
did O

the O

very O
appealing O
to O
me O

I O
love O
the O

They O
seem O
to O
be O
good O

you O

NOTHING O

It O

more O

I O
do O

I O

to O
get O
a O
good O
one O
( O

somehow O

it O
the O

but O
i O
still O
hate O
putting O
my O

it O
well O

Sometimes O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
I O
drive O
the O

close O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O

my O

everything O

I O
was O
concerned O
about O

had O
reported O

at O
first O
I O
experienced O

good O

so O

you O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
guess O
I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
've O
seen O
a O
performance O
increase O
when O
loading O
Photoshop O
or O
Lightroom O
, O
but O
I O
could O
also O
just O
be O
allowing O
myself O
to O
think O
that O
to O
justify O
spending O
$ O
50 O
on O
memory O
. O

and O
I O
'll O
do O
my O
best O
to O
answer O
. O

I O
also O
ca O
n't O
replace O
my O
electronics O
in O
some O
places O
that O
I O
visit O
, O
and O
these O
tend O
to O
be O
places O
where O
proper O
regulation O
of O
power O
is O
most O
in O
question O
. O

I O
love O
this O
product O
and O
have O
owned O
it O
for O
over O
2 O
years O
now O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
cord O
wrap O
is O
a O
nice O
little O
bonus O
that O
I O
actually O
had O
a O
use O
for O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
size O
and O
it O
's O
durable O

However O
, O
since O
I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
word O
processing O
, O
the O
keyboard O
and O
the O
touchpad O
buttons O
were O
a O
real O
concern O
. O

Probably O
a O
cost O
saving O
move O
and O
a O
response O
to O
a O
low O
demand O
for O
items O
like O
this O
now O
. O

Why O
did O
I O
subtract O
a O
star O
? O

While O
Toshiba O
denies O
it O
, O
the O
cooling O
system O
just O
could O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
heat O
the O
processor O
produced O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
laptop O
you O
can O
leave O
it O
plugged O
in O
all O
the O
time O
and O
you O
will O
not O
even O
notice O
it O
is O
there O
. O

We O
got O
three O

" O
ultra O
portable O
, O
and O
really O
liked O
the O
memory O

like O
material O
, O
so O
I O
got O

unless O
your O
a O
wizard O
at O

i O
'd O
imagine O
you O
having O
as O
hard O
of O
a O
time O
getting O
this O
on O
as O
i O
did O
. O

When O
I O
had O
books O
in O
a O
book O
bag O
, O
my O
shoulders O
were O
in O
pain O
. O

If O
you O
only O
want O
the O
pen O
function O
for O
example O
, O
you O
may O
be O
better O
off O
spending O
about O
the O
same O
money O
to O
get O
the O
high O
performance O
, O
higher O
res O
professional O
version O
of O
this O

item O
( O
called O

The O
capacity O
of O
this O

is O
slightly O
less O
than O
the O

battery O
. O

issue.-----Don't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
this O
is O
a O
powerful O
machine O
that O
rivals O
almost O
any O
other O
laptop O
in O
the O
market O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

At O
the O
very O
least O
it O
means O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
controlled O
fire O
, O
and O
a O
wild O
fire O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
possible O
loss O
of O

. O

The O

does O
n't O
work O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O

So O
I O
purchased O
the O
product O
via O
Amazon O
. O

Depending O
upon O
your O
hands O
, O
you O
may O
find O
otherwise O
. O

I O
've O
used O
Corsair O
, O
Kingston O
, O
PNY O
, O
Crucial O
, O
and O
others O
when O
dealing O
with O
my O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
. O

I O
am O
sitting O
here O
in O
a O
Quiet O
house O
and O
it O
makes O
very O
little O
noise-----a O
slight O
hum O
in O
the O
background O
. O

The O
low O
profile O
makes O
it O
great O
for O
keeping O
in O
my O
Volvo O
C30 O
's O
center O
console O
- O
nothing O
can O
knock O
it O
around O
. O

Fast O
and O
accurate O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
find O
out O
what O
brand O
or O
what O
kind O
of O
converter O
works O
with O
what O
TV O
. O

when O
my O
mouse O
starts O
to O
die O
I O
can O
wrap O
it O
back O
around O
past O
my O
keyboard O
and O
plug O
that O
in O
. O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
these O
cloths O
! O

I O
read O
reviews O
about O
people O
downloading O
a O
lot O
of O
data O
at O
once O
and O
it O
took O
a O
while O
to O
transfer O

This O
unit O
seems O
to O
be O
solidly O
built O
, O
and O
is O
the O
highest O
powered O
laptop O
charger O
I O
've O
used O
. O

Great O
look O
, O
very O
light O
and O
a O
goo O
screen O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
happen O
two O
more O
times O
since O
that O
happened O
. O

Touchpad O
by O
Synaptics O
is O
seriously O
defective O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
tested O
with O
heavy O
file O
transfer O
or O
playing O
network O
games O
, O
it O
's O
more O
than O
enough O
for O
Internet O
connection O
and O
daily O
office O
use O
on O
a O
local O
area O
network O
. O

With O
my O
Galaxy O
Note O
3 O
, O
I O
still O
have O
n't O
tested O
this O
. O

Light O
enough O
to O
take O
with O
me O
when O
I O
travel O
; O
the O
included O
velcro O
strap O
enables O
me O
to O
store O
my O
laptop O
efficiently O
enough O
with O
the O
stand O
when O
traveling O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
the O
mixer O
would O
n't O
work O
with O
it O
, O
but O
I O
said O
screw O
it O
and O
bought O
it O
. O

If O
you O
like O
creating O
short O
films O
or O
Youtube O
videos O
, O
the O
speed O
of O
creating O
and O
uploading O
films O
is O
incredibly O
fast O
and O
easy O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
an O
Acer O
C720 O
chromebook O
. O

So O
in O
conclusion O
: O
PROS O
: O

I O
did O
use O
the O
CD O
initially O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
. O

The O
users O
of O
Windows O
ultrabooks O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
should O
really O
appreciate O
all O
the O
additional O
connectivity O
that O
this O
adapter O
offers O
. O

I O
normally O
carry O
a O
77 O
mm O
circular O
polariser O
and O
a O
neutral O
density O
gradient O
filter O
in O
two O
separate O
pouches O
. O

Longer O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
, O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
playing O
movies O
! O

This O
is O
a O
higher O
end O
notebook O
that O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
portable O
. O

Get O
one O
if O
you O
need O
additional O
USB O
ports O
. O

Still O
- O
fits O
well O
and O
should O
provide O
good O
protection O
. O

I O
needed O
this O
to O
power O
a O
27&#34 O
; O
monitor O
I O
purchased O
from O
Goodwill O
. O

The O
case O
is O
well O
made O
and O
provides O
good O
padding O
for O
a O
small O
laptop O
. O

I O
needed O
windows O
7 O
and O
this O
met O
my O
needs O
. O

No O
tinkering O
with O
any O
drop O
down O
boxes O
or O
anything O
. O

I O
hang O
it O
on O
my O
umbrella O
and O
I O
use O
it O
with O
my O
iPhone O
to O
stream O
Pandora O
. O

It O
would O
be O
an O
excellent O
laptop O
if O
it O
had O
backlit O
keys O
and O
a O
slot O
for O
a O
secondary O
battery O
so O
you O
could O
switch O
one O
out O
while O
the O
other O
was O
charging O
. O

Box O
says O
its O
15 O
megapixels O
... O

This O
thing O
is O
just O
flimsy O
. O

writen O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

Great O
little O
unit O
. O

When O
I O
looked O
closer O
, O
the O
iM7 O
's O
design O
really O
began O
to O
grow O
on O
me O
. O

So O
I O
bought O
this O
thing O
because O
I O
did O
a O
bunch O
traveling O
for O
my O
job O
this O
year O
. O

Although O
the O
OS O
X O
operating O
system O
does O
not O
permit O
Blu O
- O
ray O
disc O
playback O
, O
you O
can O
use O
a O
Blu O
- O
ray O
drive O
with O
MakeMKV O
to O
rip O
the O
encription O
off O
of O
Blu O
- O
ray O
discs O
and O
convert O
them O
to O
MKV O
format O

The O
best O
thing O
for O
bicycling O
ever O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
device O
has O
that O
capability O
. O

I O
compared O
it O
to O
the O
MacBook O
and O

( O
Google O
: O
GlobalSat O
Bu-353 O
Windows O
7 O
) O
, O
where O
you O
will O
come O
across O
hundreds O
of O
threads O
about O
how O
their O
drivers O
are O
n't O
compatible O
with O
Vista O
/ O
Windows O
7 O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
two O
pack O
because O
lens O
caps O
are O
always O
wandering O
away O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
week O
, O
it O
blue O
screened O
2 O
more O
times O
upon O
rebooting O
. O

Sony O
and O
Sharp O
. O

I O
really O
could O
n't O
imagine O
it O
being O
any O
better O
built O
in O
fact O
. O

and O
she O
knew O
that O
I O
would O
like O
the O
color O

The O
color O
is O
good O
looking O
too&#65292;love O
this O
bag~~~ O

I O
was O
bit O
skeptic O
at O
first O
of O
some O
poor O
reviews O
claiming O
this O
to O
have O
poor O
sound O
- O
they O
must O
be O
SUPER O
picky O
or O
their O
sound O
card O
must O
be O
messed O
up O
. O

& O
I O
'm O
never O
going O
back O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
try O
out O
a O
WiFi O
card O
, O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
have O
good O
compatibility O
in O
a O
solid O
memory O
card O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
sound O
though O
, O
all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
buy O
a O
nice O
, O
inexpensive O
pair O
of O
computer O
speakers O
such O
asLogitech O
S220 O
2 O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
the O
specs O
are O
different O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
image O
is O
much O
better O
. O

So O
I O
purchased O
this O
Asus O
( O
which O
had O
been O
re O
- O
furbished O
for O
Amazon O
Warehouse O
Deals O
) O
. O

It O
is O
probably O
a O
great O
product O
from O
the O
reviews O
, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
help O
netbook O
owners O
with O
the O
info O
I O
just O
got O
from O
Logitech O
, O
after O
$ O
1 O
. O

Videos O
on O
You O
Tube O
are O
a O
mixed O
bag O
that O
depends O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
original O
. O

I O
wish O
the O
string O
of O
6 O
LED O
lights O
at O
the O
front O
left O
had O
accompanying O
legible O
icons O
on O
the O
keyboard O
surface O
- O

This O
product O
is O
well O
suited O
for O
macs O
I O
think O
for O
two O
reasons O
: O
macs O
cooling O
is O
primarily O
by O
conduction O
to O
the O
aluminum O
casing O
, O
with O
the O
air O
fan O
being O
for O
backup O
cooling O
. O

( O
I O
'll O
spend O
that O
on O
dropping O
2 O
gigs O
into O
the O
RAM O
) O
. O

When O
I O
purchased O
the O
charger O
, O
everything O
worked O
. O

I O
listen O
to O
wav O
, O
FLAC O
or O
wav O
compressed O
at O
320 O
kb O
MP3s O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
amazing O
ultra O
- O
books O
, O
maybe O
even O
of O
all O
laptops O
, O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
and O
have O
had O
to O
pleasure O
to O
use O
. O

I O
deducted O
one O
star O
for O
that O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
a O
nice O
machine O
, O
but O
I O
would O
never O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

Pen O
and O
CD O
compartment O
: O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Apple O
makes O
GOOD O
STUFF!== O

a O
battery O
that O
will O
last O
proportionately O
in O
time O
what O
you O
paid O
for O
it O
against O
how O
much O
you O
would O
of O
paid O
for O
a O
real O
Apple O
battery O
. O

There O
was O
no O
problem O
with O
receiving O
this O
battery O
or O
the O
packaging O
or O
dealing O
with O
the O
seller O
. O

FWIW O
, O
I O
wound O
up O
purchasing O
the O
3 O
foot O
3 O
. O

No O
problems O
with O
Lion O
OS O
... O

so O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
this O
stuff O
before O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

The O
display O
has O
a O
very O
narrow O
view O
angle O
, O
and O
the O
colors O
appear O
washed O
out O
even O
after O
major O
adjustment O
. O

my O
last O
travel O
speaker O
had O
6feet O
of O
cables O
and O
made O
a O
really O
big O
mess O
when O
i O
was O
trying O
to O
setup O
my O
laptop O
in O
small O
areas O
. O

So O
, O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
and O
get O
a O
custom O
built O
system O
instead O
. O

I O
like O
the O
small O
usb O
wireless O
mouse O
transmitter O
a O
lot O

I O
only O
had O
to O
point O
it O
to O
my O
wireless O
network O
and O
enter O
the O
modem O
password O
. O

I O
deliberately O
let O
my O
battery O
died O
and O
plugged O
it O
back O
in O
and O
it O
charges O
it O
back O
up O
to O
100 O
% O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
listeners O
are O
astonished O
and O
immediately O
want O
to O
know O
where O
they O
can O
get O
one O
. O

And O
these O
hotels O
only O
provide O
LAN O
port O
connection O
which O
does O
n't O
work O
with O
either O
kindle O
or O
ipad O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
this O
for O
long O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
its O
longevity O
, O
but O
so O
far O
I O
am O
impressed O
. O

Well O
my O
friend O
has O
the O
same O
computer O
and O
her O
charger O
just O
went O
out O
( O
half O
a O
year O
later O
) O

Great O
product O
easy O
to O
use O
as O
said O
in O
description O
and O
perfect O
was O
to O
watch O
movies O
on O
my O
23 O
inch O
monitor O

I O
think O
when O
I O
finish O
installing O
Windows O
XP O
SP2 O

The O
cable O
itself O
is O
not O
flimsy O
and O
seems O
like O
it O
will O
be O
serviceable O
for O
some O
time O
to O
come O
. O

This O
device O
" O
came O
to O
the O
rescue O
" O
with O
a O
fast O
wired O
connection O
. O

Re O
- O
chargeable O
unit O
is O
very O
convenient O
. O

As O
a O
bonus O
, O
it O
gives O
me O
just O
the O
extra O
length O
I O
need O
to O
keep O
the O
cable O
wrapped O
up O
for O
easy O
transport O
. O

Good O
purchase O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
! O

Nice O
to O
have O
HDMI O
coming O
out O
of O
my O
laptop O
. O

Not O
to O
say O
you O
could O
n't O
use O
it O
for O
those O
things O
, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
probably O
not O
that O
specific O
. O

A O
great O
cooler O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
built O
very O
well O
. O

I O
have O
Two O
of O
these O
ikick O
501 O
's O
, O

I O
still O
gave O
this O
card O
a O
5-star O
because O
the O
compatibility O
issues O
was O
my O
mistake O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
get O
original O
bluelounge O
CableDrops O
; O
the O
knockoffs O
use O
cheap O
adhesives O
and O
do O
n't O
stick O
very O
well O
. O

So O
before O
you O
buy O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
if O
its O
the O
battery O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

but O
until O
they O
fix O
this O
tablet O
and O
come O
with O
a O
better O
price O
I O
think O
I O
will O
pass O

Took O
it O
out O
and O
noticed O
the O
outer O
layer O
at O
corners O
started O
to O
peel O
off O
. O

Since O
this O
speaker O
has O
only O
up O
and O
down O
volume O
buttons O
you O
ca O
n't O
control O
your O
phone O
or O
tablet O
. O

It O
seems O
sturdy O
, O
so O
it O
should O
last O
, O
but O
it O
still O
is O
flexible O
. O

Recording O
locally O
( O
on O
my O
laptop O
) O
provides O
very O
good O
video O
as O
well O
. O

The O
bottom O
of O
this O
bag O
is O
made O
of O
some O
kind O
of O
hard O
material O
( O
not O
so O
hard O
, O
but O
can O
take O
minor O
punches).The O
inner O
compartments O
are O
all O
padded O
well O
, O
but O
as O
I O
have O
n't O
taken O
the O
bag O
out O
for O
any O
real O
outdoor O
shooting O
, O
I O
can O
not O
vouch O
on O
how O
effective O
the O
padding O
are O
, O
as O
some O
of O
the O
lenses O
are O
loose O
in O
the O
compartments O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
windows O
8 O
and O
it O
is O
flawless O
. O

Would O
not O
load O
under O
Win O
7 O
, O
would O
load O
under O
Win O
8 O
, O
but O
was O
unstable O
, O
unsteady O
, O
lots O
of O
packet O
loss O
, O
loss O
of O
speed O
was O
incredible O
. O

The O
buttons O
on O
this O
mouse O
are O
well O
placed O
and O
easy O
to O
press O
. O

I O
am O
an O
avid O
mac O
person O
, O
and O
I O
have O
Imac O
and O
macbook O
( O
just O
sold O
) O

The O
keyboard O
felt O
a O
little O
weird O
when O
I O
typed O
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
I O
can O
overcome O
this O
feat O
. O

I O
have O
4 O
of O
these O
at O
one O
of O
my O
customer O
. O

257 O
g O
are O
only O
for O
data O
out O
of O
750 O
g O
. O

It O
took O
a O
little O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
very O
flat O
keys O
but O

It O
has O
it O
's O
own O
media O
browser O
that O
looks O
similar O
to O
Windows O
Media O
Center O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
use O
these O
to O
hold O
mini O
- O
batteries O
for O
flash O
transmitters O
. O

How O
loud O
the O
two O
get O
is O
easy O
to O
distinguish O
, O
yes O
. O

The O
controls O
work O
well O
with O
Pandora O
and O
Google O
's O
Play O
Music O
apps O
, O
however O
, O
the O
backlight O
is O
quite O
dim O
and O
difficult O
to O
see O
. O

You O
can O
actually O
screw O
it O
into O
the O
outlet O
, O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
. O

There O
's O
not O
much O
wiggle O
room O
in O
this O
carry O
case O
. O

only O
problem O
is O
managing O
the O
wire O

My O
mother O
loves O
this O
item O
. O

Nice O
idea O
of O
smaller O
space O
/ O
lower O
cost O
but O
still O
needs O
some O
work O
. O

I O
got O
it O
in O
aqua O
and O
the O
color O
is O
exactly O
as O
seen O
on O
my O
computer O
screen O
. O

The O
battery O
set O
arrived O
as O
expected O
. O

AND O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
the O
deal O
breaker O
came O
down O
to O
choice O
: O
MacBook O
gave O
a O
choice O
between O
Black O
and O
White O
. O

Overall O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
product O
but O
there O
are O
some O
minor O
flaws O
preventing O
it O
from O
being O
a O
great O
one O
. O

and O
I O
'd O
use O
it O
when O
riding O
my O
bicycle O
at O
20 O
+ O
MPH O
. O

Wo O
n't O
carry O
everything O

Speaker O
sound O
quality O
is O
poor9 O
) O
Does O
n't O
wake O
from O
sleep O
when O
you O
open O
the O
lid O
( O
can O
be O
either O
a O
Win8 O
bug O
or O
hardware O
issue O
) O

I O
bought O
a O
Targus O
padded O
iPad O
case O
for O
my O
iPad O
that O
I O
loved O
. O

I O
like O
the O
padded O
, O
over O
- O
ear O
style O
; O
the O
headset O
is O
pretty O
comfortable O
, O
and O
I O
can O
wear O
it O
for O
quite O
awhile O
without O
any O
irritation O
. O

I O
took O
it O
out O
, O
even O
though O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
for O
attachments O
, O
which O
is O
another O
reason O
why O
the O
outside O
pocket O
was O
even O
more O
useless O
. O

I O
'm O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
overall O
for O
the O
price O
! O

And O
the O
best O
part O
, O
I O
threw O
away O
all O
my O
DVD O
's O
because O
I O
was O
going O
military O
deployment O
and O
moving O
shortly O
after O
I O
came O
back O
from O
the O
desert O
. O

It O
found O
it O
, O
drivers O
were O
there O
and O
updated O
, O
but O
nothing O
would O
make O
it O
recognize O
and O
connect O
to O
the O
card O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
it O
for O
over O
a O
month O
with O
great O
success O
. O

Basically O
, O
touch O
screen O
presses O
react O
as O
if O
you O
had O
left O
- O
click O
with O
the O
mouse O
and O
, O
if O
you O
need O
more O
precision O
, O
you O
can O
drag O
on O
the O
screen O
and O
it O
will O
highlight O
items O
. O

At O
this O
price O
, O
you O
simply O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
buying O
the O
T100 O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
keep O
using O
it O
until O
its O
wheels O
fall O
off O
. O

It O
works O
for O
the O
purpose O
I O
was O
hoping O
, O
but O
this O
is O
n't O
a O
sound O
system O
so O
do O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
sound O
like O
a O
sound O
bar O
for O
your O
MP3 O
or O
phone O
. O

If O
the O
wall O
charger O
worked O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
5/5 O
review O
, O
and O
maybe O
I O
just O
got O
a O
defect O
, O
who O
knows O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
went O
to O
the O
internet O
, O
the O
same O
things O
kept O
happening O
. O

I O
love O
the O
different O
ways O
you O
can O
set O
the O
camera O
up O
to O
your O
monitor O
. O

: O
Back O
Side O
: O
> O
miniplug O
port O
for O
audio O
input O

i O
got O
this O
one O
to O
use O
strictly O
as O
a O
tablet O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
case O
is O
made O
out O
of O
PU O
leather O
. O

so O
if O
you O
need O
a O
cat O
5 O
cable O
that O
s O
cheap O
buy O
this O
. O

It O
was O
definitely O
the O
cord O
as O
the O
phone O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
other O
cords O
. O

My O
young O
son O
recently O
had O
a O
birthday O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
share O
the O
pictures O
I O
was O
taking O
with O
everyone O
at O
the O
party O
instantly O
without O
ever O
having O
to O
take O
the O
card O
out O
of O
my O
camera O
! O

Right O
- O
click O
using O
two O
fingers O
has O
always O
been O
a O
problem O
, O
as O
at O
the O
moment O
you O
put O
two O
fingers O
, O
the O
cursor O
will O
move O
around O
and O
select O
a O
wrong O
area O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
model O
at O
a O
local O
superstore O
. O

I O
had O
a O
different O
company O
's O
bluetooth O
dongle O
previously O
, O
they O
were O
very O
lax O
about O
supporting O
it O
for O
Windows O
8 O
. O

There O
are O
enough O
compartments O
for O
the O
little O
things O
. O

Having O
an O
Acer O
& O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
I O
already O
knew O
that O
the O
Samsung O
form O
factor O
and O
design O
was O
more O
to O
my O
liking O
. O

I O
needed O
this O
adapter O
for O
my O
ASUS O
netbook O
running O
the O
Windows O
7 O
Starter O
( O
32bit O
) O
operating O
system O

I O
saw O
the O
poor O
reviews O
for O
this O
product O

I O
used O
a O
couple O
of O
countersunk O
wood O
screws O
instead O
. O

With O
MacBook O
Air O
you O
have O
to O
spend O
money O
for O
an O
Ethernet O
Adapter O
that O
is O
only O
rated O
for O
10/100 O
Ethernet O
and O
uses O
up O
one O
of O
the O
two O
USB2 O
ports O
. O

It O
can O
be O
an O
issue O
with O
high O
power O
draw O
devices O
like O
hard O
drives O
that O
do O
not O
have O
a O
separate O
power O
source O
. O

Book O
Two O
of O
the O
Finding O
Financial O
Freedom O
Series O

I O
'm O
happy O
I O
can O
fix O
the O
problem O
for O
$ O
10 O
. O

I O
than O
ran O
my O
compare O
utility O
and O
got O
221 O
MB O
/ O
s O
. O

I O
would O
give O
a O
five O
star O
if O
more O
RAM O
is O
offered O
with O
double O
the O
processing O
speed O
and O
the O
same O
8 O
hour O
battery O
life O
. O

I O
play O
an O
online O
game O
called O
Clan O
Lord O
. O

so O
I O
do O
not O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
batteries O
, O
limited O
time O
. O

If O
you O
purchase O
any O
Apple O
product O
, O
buy O
the O
warranty O
. O

It O
's O
bigger O
than O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
though O
since O
the O
wall O
plug O
swivels O
, O
you O
can O
orient O
this O
thing O
any O
way O
you O
want O
to O
not O
block O
other O
outlets O
. O

This O
i3 O
runs O
very O
cool O
and O
is O
built O
into O
the O
smallest O
laptop O
frame O
Acer O
provides O
, O
and O
I O
even O
have O
a O
little O
accessory O
carrying O
case O
for O
it O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
install O
Windows O
7 O
64 O
OEM O
and O
still O
had O
8 O
GB O
of O
free O
space O
left O
. O

no O
voip O
like O
skype O

but O
you O
need O
a O
magnifying O
glasses O
to O
read O
these O
awful O
instructions O
. O

Integer O
Operations O

It O
started O
getting O
hot O
, O
and O
then O
it O
ceased O
to O
charge O
any O
more O
; O
the O
LED O
is O
out O

All O
around O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
bag O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
carry O
more O
than O
just O
the O
netbook O
and O
want O
more O
protection O
than O
the O
average O
sleeve O
. O

So O
much O
so O
that O
when O
I O
use O
it O
in O
my O
car O
I O
have O
to O
hold O
it O
up O
to O
my O
ear O
to O
hear O
it O
! O

so O
pink O
wo O
n't O
draw O
any O
funny O
looks O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
. O

Sure O
, O
it O
stands O
out O
, O
but O
it O
makes O
a O
very O
nice O
contrast O
to O
bland O
. O

Plenty O
of O
room O
for O
everything O
. O

Thus O
, O
overheating O
of O
the O
internal O
electronics O
is O
a O
chronic O
problem O
. O

I O
use O
my O
lap O
top O
with O
Street O
Atlas O
GPS O
so O
it O
is O
on O
for O
a O
long O
time O
in O
my O
car O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
weird O
contour O
thing O
either O
. O

This O
bag O
has O
an O
element O
of O
flimsiness O
about O
it O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
something O
that O
would O
provide O
cushion O
and O
protection O
and O
it O
works O
for O
that O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
is O
just O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
other O
machine O
. O

only O
downside O
is O
that O
it O
's O
an O
ugly O
little O
thing O
, O
but O
given O
its O
good O
strength O
and O
range O
, O
it O
should O
be O
easy O
enough O
to O
hide O
behind O
something O
more O
pretty O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
excellent O
price O
. O

This O
got O
worse O
by O
the O
day O
where O
after O
6 O
days O
it O
will O
not O
even O
work O
anymore O
. O

It O
is O
a O
inexpensive O
replacement O
that O
produced O
the O
same O
results O
as O
the O
Dell O
version O
. O

It O
offends O
my O
sensibilities O
to O
call O
that O
a O
subwoofer.- O
No O
digital O
or O
USB O
connection O
, O
if O
you O
are O
in O
to O
that O
sort O
of O
thing.- O

the O
ASUS O
1005PE O
is O
mentioned O
explicitly O
in O
its O
description O
. O

Love O
that O
I O
can O
use O
this O
remote O
instead O
. O

After O
having O
the O
unit O
a O
while O
, O
I O
had O
it O
break O
on O
me O
. O

All O
of O
my O
third O
party O
cables O
have O
started O
to O
go O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
replace O
their O
original O
keyboard O
. O

So O
, O
I O
started O
buying O
only O
Ogio O
bags O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
is O
a O
back O
- O
lit O
keyboard O
. O

It O
has O
lasted O
fairly O
well O
for O
a O
year O
. O

Over O
a O
period O
of O
several O
weeks O
I O
tried O
out O
the O
following O
. O

This O
arrived O
very O
quickly O
from O
the O
seller O
in O
just O
two O
days O
. O

Sure O
, O
there O
are O
better O
laptops O
out O
there O
that O
will O
definitely O
have O
better O
screen O
res O
, O
but O
you O
will O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

I O
called O
ASUS O
tech O
support O
( O
which O
is O
superb O
! O

This O
product O
comes O
in O
a O
clamshell O
package O
, O
but O
kudos O
to O
the O
designers O
. O

It O
does O
have O
a O
random O
reboot O
about O
once O
every O
three O
weeks O
, O
but O
it O
really O
does O
n't O
bother O
me O
. O

b O
) O
has O
a O
small O
blue O
LED O
light O
that O
flashed O
briefly O
when O
turned O
on O
. O

so O
that O
wo O
n't O
be O
a O
major O
problem O
. O

No O
reason O
to O
spend O
the O
big O
bucks O
, O
this O
little O
number O
will O
do O
just O
fine O
. O

Instead O
, O
you O
could O
still O
move O
the O
cursor O
while O
sliding O
across O
the O
buttons O
. O

Old O
battery O
got O
down O
to O
only O
30 O
minutes O
on O
a O
full O
charge O
but O
this O
battery O
will O
give O
you O
up O
to O
9 O
hours O
on O
a O
full O
charge O
. O

I O
have O
now O
gone O
through O
all O
six O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
it O
scratched O
. O

I O
originally O
planned O
on O
tearing O
the O
whole O
thing O
apart O
and O
following O
a O
tedious O
DIY O
project O
to O
make O
terminals O
, O
etc O
. O

so O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
take O
it O
on O
flights O
. O

I O
ordered O
it O
at O
about O
2 O
PM O
on O
a O
Monday O
and O
had O
it O
delivered O
to O
my O
front O
door O
by O
11 O
AM O
the O
next O
day O
. O

This O
product O
was O
provided O
for O
review O
by O
Focus O
on O
Bluetooth O
. O

It O
's O
a O
keyboard O
not O
a O
touchscreen O
with O
up O
arrows O
, O
number O
and O
symbol O
change O
keys O
. O

Despite O
occasional O
lost O
connections O
( O
which O
I O
attributed O
to O
my O
failure O
to O
get O
the O
plug O
seated O
properly O
) O
, O
it O
provided O
generally O
reliable O
service O
for O
about O
16 O
months O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
basic O
sturdy O
case O
this O
is O
it O
. O

and O
I O
tried O
hard O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
cover O
, O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
brand O
new O
MBP O
. O

This O
is O
a O
small O
dvd O
player O
with O
a O
big O
heart O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
mentioned O
the O
issue O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
no O
pattern O
develops O
in O
the O
reviews O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
goofy O
theme O
Apple O
uses O
for O
Windows O
. O

They O
're O
small O
enough O
to O
pack O
or O
easily O
move O
around O
or O
outside O
. O

They O
sound O
pretty O
darn O
good O
- O
much O
better O
to O
my O
ears O
than O
I O
was O
led O
to O
expect O
by O
reading O
other O
reviews O
- O
although O
not O
much O
bass O
they O
easily O
crank O
up O
enough O
to O
fill O
my O
kitchen O
area O
with O
sound O
and O
loud O
enough O
for O
others O
to O
tell O
me O
to O
" O
turn O
it O
down O
" O
. O

Otherwise O
nicely O
built O
, O
easy O
controls O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
was O
using O
it O
to O
power O
my O
alarm O
clock O
that O
I O
brought O
from O
home O
and O
some O
other O
small O
draw O
appliances O
. O

I O
've O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
Creative O
Labs O
ever O
since O
I O
replaced O
my O
dead O
AdLib O
sound O
card O
with O
a O
Creative O
over O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
being O
filled O
up O
. O

It O
also O
makes O
it O
a O
visible O
target O
for O
theft O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
for O
heavy O
tasks O
like O
animation O
or O
video O
editing O
; O
instead O
it O
runs O
several O
word O
and O
excel O
documents O
( O
sometimes O
up O
to O
5 O
documents O
at O
the O
same O
time O
) O
, O
while O
using O
the O
internet O
, O
and O
it O
has O
never O
let O
us O
down O
. O

Wow O
, O
just O
wow O
. O

It O
was O
used O
3 O
times O
as O
of O
February O
and O
now O
it O
wo O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
( O
it O
wo O
n't O
charge O
) O
. O

However O
if O
you O
're O
editing O
video O
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
right O
machine O
for O
you O
. O

The O
software O
takes O
over O
the O
computer O
and O
slows O
down O
the O
whole O
back O
- O
up O
process O
. O

But O
the O
keyboard O
, O
what O
a O
POS O
. O

Not O
the O
best O
quality O
cable O
, O
but O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
it O
. O

Several O
times O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
charging O
my O
computer O
only O
to O
find O
that O
the O
plug O
was O
not O
making O
contact O
. O

Amazon O
's O
shipment O
and O
service O
top O
- O
notch O
per O
usual O
. O

So O
there O
is O
something O
to O
be O
said O
for O
the O
simplicity O
of O
these O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
all O
around O
MP3 O
player O
... O
this O
is O
the O
one O
to O
buy O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
think O
the O
reason O
many O
of O
these O
name O
- O
brand O
PCs O
have O
become O
as O
cheap O
as O
they O
are O
is O
that O
some O
of O
the O
components O
they O
use O
are O
cheap O
and O
are O
lacking O
in O
quality O
. O

Overall O
a O
great O
product O
. O

( O
at O
, O
what O
, O
1/3 O
of O
the O
price O
HP O
wants O
for O
one O
? O
! O
? O
) O

While O
this O

My O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
swap O
this O

for O
one O
of O

that O
have O
a O

well O
, O
I O

... O

It O
's O
cool O
that O
it O
's O
thin O
and O
does O
have O
a O
read O
light O
pointer O
but O
does O
n't O
scroll O
like O
a O
mouse O
and O
ca O
n't O
move O
the O
curser O

Likewise O
the O

The O
small O

factor O

the O
increased O

My O
husband O
's O

was O
getting O
old O
and O
worn O
out O

so O
I O
got O
this O
replacement O

Using O

This O
is O

Spend O
the O
extra O
$ O
10 O
- O

to O
get O
a O

. O

This O
worked O
well O
to O

probably O

It O
takes O

when O
the O

accidentally O
got O
unplugged O
, O
the O
laptop O
got O
quite O
hot O
, O
running O
on O
just O
the O
battery O
, O
so O
for O
me O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
downside O
, O
if O
I O
ever O
had O
to O
rely O
on O

Well O
, O
unless O

off O

just O
use O
your O

an O
extra O

protection O

It O
performs O
as O
advertised O

Instead O
I O
plugged O
it O
into O
my O

After O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
it O
gets O
warm O

makes O
my O

Not O
too O
soft O
and O
not O
to O
stiff O

Please O
do O
n't O
think O
of O
this O
as O
a O
case O
, O
it O
is O
a O
sleeve O

I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
looking O
for O

I O
even O
did O

it O

This O

to O
match O

Not O

often O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
bought O
the O
larger O

I O
was O
able O
to O
take O
more O

I O
've O
had O
it O

and O
i O
even O
bought O
the O

ended O
up O

it O

it O
made O

effectively O
doubling O
its O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
this O

, O
definitely O
a O
quality O
buy O
for O
the O
money O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
long O
cable O
, O
but O
I O
've O
recently O
learned O
that O
some O
cables O
carry O
more O
current O
than O
others O
, O
and O
this O
one O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O

I O
added O

I O
highly O

as O
well O
as O

Windows O

gives O
the O

an O
Experience O

, O
and O
then O
( O
barely O
) O
updated O
for O
the O
first O
round O
of O
OS O
X. O

I O
have O
to O
wiggle O
it O
around O
for O
it O
to O
fit O
and O
get O
a O
charge O
. O

make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
& O
# O
34;WLAN O
AutoConfig&#34 O
; O
service O
set O
up O
to O
run O
& O
# O
34;Automatically&#34 O
; O
and O
that O
you O
start O
it O
up O
. O

However O
, O
when O
I O
received O
it O
, O
I O
stuck O
a O
velcro O
piece O
on O
the O
& O
# O
34;Canon&#34 O
; O
logo O
and O
put O
a O
U. O
S. O
flag O
on O
it O
. O

It O
runs O
a O
relatively O
modern O
Atom O
processor O
and O
has O
limited O
RAM O
. O

Nowadays O
I O
'll O
fork O
out O
$ O
20 O
or O
$ O
30 O
on O
some O
Monster O
Cables O
and O
they O
'll O
crap O
out O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

The O
power O
brick O
is O
as O
large O
as O
a O
laptop O
adapter O
and O
the O
hub O
itself O
is O
pretty O
large O
. O

and O
I O
received O
one O
of O
these O
as O
a O
Christmas O
gift O
. O

The O
pocket O
on O
the O
inside O
cover O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
I O
still O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
. O

Hope O
this O
fan O
lasts O
long O
, O
but O
i O
think O
it O
will O
. O

The O
mids O
and O
highs O
blow O
me O
away O
for O
being O
so O
small O
, O
it O
's O
deceitful O
. O

Awsome O
HHD O
docking O
station O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
getting O
the O
picture O
that O
this O
device O
however O
great O
, O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
that O
reliable O
for O
the O
foreseen O
future O
. O

It O
's O
working O
well O
for O
me O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

So O
picking O
up O
this O
very O
small O
light O
camera O
to O
record O
events O
was O
something O
totally O
different O
, O
I O
did O
not O
really O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
expect O
a O
lot O
quality O
wise O
when O
it O
came O
to O
images O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
software O
, O
then O
powered O
down O
and O
installed O
the O
card O
. O

, O
I O
had O
high O
hopes O
but O
was O
very O
disappointed O
. O

She O
could O
not O
take O
her O
to O
college O
. O

Includes O
an O
external O
DVD O
drive O
/ O
burner O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
VERY O
well O
made O
, O
and O
seems O
like O
it O
will O
hold O
up O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
laptop O
runs O
dead O
silent O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
take O
it O
out O
until O
bedtime O
. O

Asus O
is O
very O
clear O
that O
this O
only O
operates O
in O
EITHER O
2 O
. O

However O
, O
its O
lack O
of O
documentation O
or O
utility O
support O
for O
Linux O
and O
( O
from O
the O
other O
reviews O
posted O
here O
) O
its O
poor O
Mac O
OS O
support O
really O
limit O
its O
prospective O
user O
base O
to O
just O
those O
running O
Windows O
. O

1 O
Problem O
is O
that O
it O
only O
works O
with O
32 O
bit O
Windows O

THAT O
, O
THE O
NOTEPAL O
X3 O
IS O
ALSO O
A O
GREAT O
COOLER O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
Kindle O
, O
after O
not O
being O
all O
that O
happy O
with O
the O
previous O
case O
I O
'd O
been O
using O
( O
basically O
just O
a O
carrying O
case O
that O
I O
'd O
take O
it O
in O
and O
out O
of O
) O
. O

Easy O
to O
slide O
the O
HD O
in O
and O
out O
with O
extra O
pouch O
to O
store O
the O
cable O
. O

From O
the O
measurements O
, O
I O
thought O
this O
case O
would O
be O
huge O
for O
the O
iPad3 O
, O
but O
it O
fits O
better O
than O
I O
thought O
. O

I O
've O
known O
others O
who O
have O
mixed O
stories O
like O
we O
do O
, O
and O
so O
I O
'm O
cautious O
. O

Installed O
easily O
and O
works O
great O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
case O
for O
what O
you O
pay O
. O

I O
also O
have O
a O
Sony O
mini O
tripod O
that O
fits O
very O
well O
on O
the O
side O
as O
well O
as O
a O
pocket O
for O
business O
cards O
and O
one O
for O
a O
water O
bottle O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
others O
are O
so O
negative O
on O
this O
product O
. O

It O
charges O
de O
Dell O
Laptop O
. O

netflix O
obviously O
uses O
some O
compression O
algorithm O
to O
provide O
very O
good O
quality O
over O
the O
internet O
. O

I O
'm O
guessing O
it O
would O
fit O
other O
laptops O
better O
. O

It O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
cool O
, O
very O
quiet O
and O
now O
I O
can O
work O
with O
them O
both O
on O
my O
lap O
in O
my O
easy O
chair O
. O

There O
were O
other O
quirks O
also O
, O
like O
sudden O
improper O
ejection O
and O
the O
eSATA O
connection O
not O
always O
being O
noticed O
when O
powered O
on O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
be O
sure O
these O
are O
n't O
a O
problem O
with O
my O
Mac O
Pro O
or O
eSATA O
card O
. O

Minimal O
fingerprints O
. O

I O
calibrated O
the O
set O
with O
a O
calibration O
DVD O
which O
improved O
the O
image O
compared O
to O
the O
Samsung O
presets O
. O

Too O
much O
light O
can O
be O
worse O
. O

I O
can O
wear O
them O
over O
mine O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
tight O
. O

It O
's O
ideal O
for O
transferring O
photos O
from O
your O
digital O
camera O
. O

but O
I O
think O
1440x900 O
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
computer O
this O
size O
. O

This O
is O
NOT O
a O
normal O
condition O
. O

I O
then O
loaded O
all O
of O
my O
stuff O
into O
a O
normal O
back O
pack O
and O
it O
was O
a O
lot O
more O
comfortable O
having O
the O
weight O
evenly O
dispersed O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
music O
connoisseur O
that O
needs O
to O
hear O
various O
levels O
of O
bass O
or O
treble O
. O

The O
camera O
/ O
video O
camera O
is O
great O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
I O
think O
it O
takes O
better O
quality O
( O
or O
at O
least O
better O
looking O
pictures O
) O
than O
my O
Droid O
X. O

, O
the O
quality O
was O
actually O
not O
that O
much O
better O
! O

Also O
, O
I O
've O
seen O
reviewers O
bag O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
back O
cover O
is O
plastic O
; O
so O
what O
? O

Somewhat O
minor O
in O
most O
cases O
I O
believe O
, O
but O
it O
is O
annoying O
that O
the O
card O
basically O
becomes O
permanently O
installed O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
sound O
. O

The O
ram O
and O
ssd O
turn O
this O
laptop O
into O
a O
very O
fast O
machine O
. O

so O
I O
had O
& O
# O
34;fun&#34 O
; O
getting O
them O
to O
fit O
in O
my O
ears O

SI O
bought O
for O
my O

, O
very O
very O

to O
be O

it O
is O
not O
a O
high O

Now O
that O
is O
something O
a O
Windows O
PC O
can O
not O
do O
! O

It O
would O
be O
nicer O
if O
the O
connection O
would O
be O
muti O
- O
threaded O
and O
all O
clients O
would O
be O
connected O
to O
the O
router O
, O
but O
around O
$ O

, O
this O
is O
great O
! O

It O
has O
really O
loud O

1/19/2013As O
mentioned O
in O
the O
review O
, O
I O
've O
had O
this O
pad O
since O
February O
2012 O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
chosen O
the O
laptop O
model O
and O
matching O
keyboard O
properly O

Very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Video O
is O
bright O
and O
crisp O
with O
excellent O
contrast O
. O

Seems O
to O
be O
decent O
quality O
. O

I O
have O
taken O
my O
camera O
bag O
all O
over O
the O
world O
with O
me O
since O
I O
have O
had O
it O
. O

I O
too O
had O
problems O
installing O
the O
software O
. O

Arrived O
quickly O
and O
saved O
the O
day O
. O

I O
've O
had O
it O
about O
a O
month O
, O
and O
it O
's O
already O
starting O
to O
die O
. O

They O
're O
getting O
cheaper O
and O
you O
can O
get O
a O
120 O
GB O
or O
128 O
GB O
drive O
for O
much O
less O
than O
what O
Apple O
offers O
. O

The O
internet O
works O
great O
, O
just O
enough O
hard O
dive O
so O
that O
it O
is O
not O
bulky O
, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
loved O
more O
than O
160 O
GB O
. O

I O
have O
the O
patience O
so O
we O
will O
see O
what O
goes O
on O
trying O
to O
get O
it O
working O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
bag O
. O

I O
Purchased O
these O
for O
my O
daughter O

The O
outside O
configuration O
is O
very O
attractive O
and O
though O
highly O
polished O
does O
n't O
readily O
show O
finger O
smudges O
when O
handled O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
Transformer O
boasts O
an O
SD O
card O
slot O
and O
a O
mini O
HDMI O
port O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
get O
to O
trying O
them O
out O
right O
away O
, O
as O
I O
was O
busy O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
HDMI O
cable O
connectivity O
, O
which O
also O
works O
to O
view O
movies O
on O
a O
TV O
( O
though O
the O
higher O
- O
def O
movie O
file O
the O
better O
, O
of O
course O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
screen O
size O
of O
the O
TV O
) O
and O
just O
to O
display O
the O
tablet O
's O
desktop O
on O
a O
TV O
. O

The O
fan O
rarely O
runs O
after O
the O
bulb O
is O
turned O
off O
. O

Generic O
ac O
adapter O
for O
my O
emachines O
e627 O
laptop O
. O

I O
had O
read O
a O
lot O
on O
display O
link O
and O
was O
pretty O
skeptical O
. O

and O
I O
've O
spent O
a O
week O
so O
far O
working O
on O
getting O
this O
product O
to O
do O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

The O
homespot O
works O
better O
in O
both O
cases O
. O

This O
item O
is O
n't O
to O
be O
confused O
with O
a O
high O
quality O
audio O
system O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
for O
a O
Samsung O
SSD O
drive O
. O

At O
that O
point O
I O
waited O
a O
little O
and O
got O
this O
on O
sale O
on O
Amazon O
for O
$ O
130 O
which O
makes O
this O
a O
great O
bag O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Might O
sound O
weird O
, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
packaging O
of O
this O
unit O
, O
the O
black O
packaging O
looked O
sleek O

the O
right O
size O
and O
the O
dye O
is O
colourfast O
; O
an O
important O
point O
if O
you O
live O
in O
a O
humid O
climate O
( O
I O
do).We O
have O
three O
Kindles O
in O
my O
home O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
non O
- O
black O
Kindle O
case O
. O

I O
've O
purchased O
Corsair O
memory O
in O
the O
past O
and O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
. O

It O
's O
so O
small O
that O
it O
is O
only O
large O
enough O
to O
grab O
to O
pull O
it O
out O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

ManualPanasonic O
comes O
with O
a O
CD O
which O
installs O
a O
PDF O
manual O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
need O
to O
run O
desktop O
Windows O
software O
and O
still O
want O
tablet O
functionality O
, O
there O
's O
probably O
no O
better O
value O
than O
this O
machine O
right O
now O
. O

Kuddos O
to O
Microsoft O
for O
their O
handling O
of O
Office O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
drop O
outs O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
buying O
any O
other O
adapters O
or O
cables O
I O
need O
from O
them O
because O
I O
know O
I O
'll O
get O
consistent O
quality O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
buying O
from O
this O
seller O
. O

( O
main O
objective O
achieved O
) O

The O
touch O
screen O
is O
responsive O
, O
but O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
the O
LCD O
is O
not O
laminated O
to O
the O
plastic O
touch O
panel O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
was O
only O
$ O
229 O
, O
which O
makes O
up O
for O
many O
of O
the O
drawbacks O
. O

Charging O
did O
n't O
take O
very O
long O
and O
pairing O
was O
a O
sinch O
. O

Final O
tally O
- O
5 O
stars O
for O
a O
PC O
user O
- O
4 O
stars O
for O
a O
Mac O
- O
happy O
recording O
! O

it O
requires O
new O
batteries O
every O
2 O
or O
3 O
weeks O
, O
2 O
. O
not O
ergonomic O
, O

. O

This O
is O
why O
my O
review O
is O
somewhat O
technical O
and O
maybe O
a O
bit O
too O
wordy O
. O

Wow O
the O
packaging O
itself O
is O
a O
work O
of O
art O
! O

My O

remaining O
for O
an O
expected O
1 O
hr O
54 O
minutes O
. O

and O
I O
see O
no O
reason O
for O
the O
Apple O
branded O
one O
costing O
four O
times O
as O
much O
. O

it O
was O
just O
such O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
I O
needed O
a O
computer O
immediately O
. O

, O
the O
mac O
air O
does O
it O
all O
. O

This O
device O
does O
just O
as O
advertised O
... O
once O
it O
detects O
power O
it O
will O
re O
- O
pair O
with O
your O
music O
player O
automatically O
and O
then O
all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
hit O
play O
on O
the O
player O
. O

One O
of O
the O
buttons O
on O
the O
mouse O
touchpad O
broke O
within O
a O
couple O
months O
but O
still O
great O
laptop O
since O
I O
use O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

The O
build O
is O
what O
concerns O
me O
since O
I O
really O
just O
take O
two O
grad O
classes O
and O
use O
it O
twice O
a O
week O
. O

In O
the O
end O
I O
just O
went O
to O
CEVA O
and O
picked O
up O
the O
unit O
myself O
so O
it O
all O
worked O
out O

I O
wish O
the O
keys O
worked O
nice O
like O
another O
Black O
PU O
Leather O

I O
also O

As O
of O

, O
2005 O
I O
can O
not O
download O
a O
driver O
for O
my O
Win98se O
computer O
( O
for O
the O
Mini O
Cruzer O
) O
. O

Very O
portable O
, O
with O
lots O
of O
custom O
cases O
out O
there O
in O
the O
marketplace.(6 O
) O

It O
's O
an O
SD O
slot O
. O

The O
button O
closures O
on O
the O
pockets O
look O
great O
... O
and O
are O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
neck O
to O
actually O
use O
in O
reality O
( O
the O
ones O
I O
am O
using O
the O
most O
I O
just O
leave O
open O
generally O
, O
and O
the O
design O
does O
allow O
for O
that O
) O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
very O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eye O
, O
other O
than O
the O
cool O
blue O
glow O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
just O
push O
in O
on O
the O
dvd O
play O
door O
any O
more O
. O

Just O
works O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
they O
give O
good O
support O
. O

As O
in O
any O
speaker O
they O
take O
time O
to O
break O
in O
. O

So O
much O
so O
I O
am O
thinking O
of O
buying O
another O
for O
my O
other O
computer O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
different O
adapters O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
just O
incompatible O
. O

Worked O
great O
. O

But O
was O
this O
achieved O
solely O
through O
" O
cutting O
- O
edge O
" O
technology O
and O
innovations O
in O
computer O
science O
? O

Whatever O
material O
they O
used O
for O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
bag O
makes O
it O
very O
loud O
and O
& O
# O
34;crinkly,&#34 O
; O
but O
also O
easy O
to O
clean O
. O

usb O
port O
was O
broken O
and O
the O
metal O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
hub O
was O
snapped O
. O

I O
followed O
the O
instructions O
to O
the O
letter O
regarding O
conditioning O
of O
the O
battery O
and O
have O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
batteries O
longevity O
and O
endurance O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
the O
hunt O
for O
an O
ergonomic O
mouse O
to O
help O
with O
carpal O
tunnel O
and O
arthritis O
in O
my O
hands O
from O
overuse O
. O

And O
I O
was O
happily O
surprised O
to O
see O
it O
perform O
adequate O
if O
not O
well O
in O
most O
areas O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
use O
batteries O
at O
all O
, O
so O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
chuck O
it O
in O
your O
bag O
and O
use O
it O
anywhere O
. O

I O
'm O
sending O
it O
back O
based O
on O
the O
defect O
, O
but O
I O
will O
not O
order O
another O
one O
. O

However O
, O
I O
needed O
an O
extra O
mouse O
for O
occasional O
gaming O
on O
one O
of O
my O
extra O
computers O
but O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
budget O
to O
spend O
on O
a O
high O
end O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
too O
bright O
and O
lacks O
in O
color O
vibrancy O
. O

Like O
the O
title O
says O
, O
this O
is O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
a O
5 O
star O
device O
because O
of O
the O
" O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O
" O
you O
get O
with O
this O
device O
. O

Robustness O
was O
main O
criteria O
for O
me O
while O
buying O
and O
it O
qualifies O
on O
same O
. O

The O
display O
is O
lovely O
- O
1920x1080 O
with O
good O
brightness O
. O

I O
am O
still O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
mouse O
not O
that O
its O
complicated O
its O
just O
not O
as O
simple O
as O
the O
one O
from O
my O
old O
Compaq O
. O

This O
is O
HDMI O
's O
way O
of O
finding O
compatibility O
between O
a O
video O
source O
and O
an O
HDMI O
display O
device O
. O

This O
seller O
's O
good O
has O
said O
all O
this O
of O
their O
business O
. O

With O
heavy O
use O
in O
about O
two O
years O
the O
battery O
will O
significantly O
decline O
in O
play O
time O
and O
because O
it O
is O
glued O
to O
the O
back O
cover O
with O
a O
very O
hard O
plastic O
like O
substance O
, O
to O
replace O
it O
Logitech O
would O
have O
to O
sell O
the O
back O
cover O
along O
with O
the O
battery O
thus O
contributing O
significantly O
to O
the O
pollution O
problem O
that O
afflicts O
our O
planet O
. O

All O
the O
holes O
line O
up O
perfectly O
and O
can O
easily O
get O
to O
the O
navigation O
tabs O
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
it O
is O
garbage O
it O
broke O
just O
after O
3 O
months O
of O
using O
so O
what O
else O
is O
there O
to O
say O
? O

The O
main O
speaker O
with O
the O
Bluetooth O
receiver O
had O
all O
of O
the O
buttons O
and O
lights O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
in O
the O
car O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
usually O
mount O
my O
phone O

I O
'll O
likely O
use O
an O
Avia O
program O
to O
verify O
adjustments O
later O
, O
but O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
any O
improvement O
. O

The O
Powerbook O
excels O
at O
graphics O
and O
music O
work O
, O
and O
that O
is O
where O
my O
interests O
lie O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
that O
product O
. O

It O
is O
good O
in O
a O
situation O
then O
u O
in O
a O
close O
room O
. O

I O
get O
an O
" O
excellent O
" O
signal O
to O
my O
router O
from O
anywhere O
around O
the O
house O

You O
can O
remove O
a O
printer O
to O
a O
closet O
or O
some O
other O
out O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
way O
place O
, O
and O
still O
be O
connected O
to O
your O
computer O

I O
like O
the O
tiny O
USB O
conector O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
bag O
just O
looks O
so O
cool O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
else O
that O
even O
comes O
close O
as O
far O
as O
style O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
adapter O
to O
replace O
a O
TP O
- O
Link O
wireless O
N O
adapter O
which O
had O
died O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
use O
. O

We O
keep O
it O
at O
home O
on O
the O
coffee O
table O
and O
she O
lets O
me O
use O
it O
. O

but O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
I O
noticed O
any O
sluggishness O
when O
accessing O
my O
HDDs O
while O
connected O
via O
the O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
port O
. O

simple O
n O
innovative O
... O
the O
only O
negative O
is O
that O
it O
ca O
n't O
hold O
my O
nokia O
charging O
wire O
coz O
wire O
is O
too O
thin O

but O
I O
have O
found O
many O
things O
that O
make O
me O
prefer O
The O
Windows O
7 O
operating O
system O
... O

so O
I O
could O
have O
stereo O
sound O
in O
my O
bedroom O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
the O
YouTube O
widget O
and O
there O
is O
too O
much O
of O
a O
lag O
to O
make O
the O
experience O
anything O
but O
pleasant O
. O

I O
got O
my O
Bass O
Pulse O
speakers O
and O
hooked O
them O
up O
and O
immediately O
noticed O
the O
difference O
! O

Bought O
it O
to O
use O
only O
temporarily O
so O
my O
goal O
was O
to O
buy O
something O
cheap O
... O
but O
hopefully O
of O
decent O
quality O
. O

no O
need O
to O
spend O
extra O
$ O
$ O
$ O
for O
Nikon O
brand O
lens O
cap O
. O

You O
can O
put O
everything O
in O
this O
bag O
including O
the O
kitchen O
sink O
! O

had O
it O
for O
2 O
plus O
years O
and O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

These O
two O
TP O
- O
Link O
cards O
are O
an O
excellent O
choice O
. O

The O

all O

This O
is O
extremely O
misleading O

Everyone O
knows O
Macbook O

are O
" O
consumable O
" O
, O
usually O
dying O
within O
2 O
years O
due O
to O
cable O
issues O
or O
electronics O
failure O
. O

Not O
a O
lot O
to O
say O
here O
: O
the O
cable O
works O
fine O
and O
is O
thick O
enough O
to O
avoid O
tangling O
, O
but O
it O
wears O
out O
in O
about O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
. O

I O
have O
a O
couple O
of O
high O
quality O
iHome O

at O

and O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
good O
. O

You O
can O
argue O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
touchscreen O
or O
Windows O
8 O
, O
or O
that O
1080p O
makes O
the O
words O

small O

that O

Wifi O
works O
great O

The O

never O
really O

you O

there O
is O
a O

of O

is O
very O
hard O

read O

eventually O
you O

bought O

from O

they O
thought O
I O
had O
just O

because O
they O
look O
so O

Now O
you O

what O
they O
do O
for O

The O
one O
thing O
you O
will O
notice O
about O
these O

is O
their O

work O
period O

Windows O
and O
Intel O
announced O
precision O
touchpads O
in O
late O
2013 O
and O
promised O
they O
'd O
start O
arriving O
in O
2014 O
, O
but O
not O
a O
one O
has O
been O
released O
yet O
. O

The O
paid O
for O
shipping O
but O
not O
the O
box O
which O
was O
only O
~30 O
dollars O
, O
and O
the O
repair O
was O
done O
in O
about O
3 O
days O
, O
they O
even O
fixed O
a O
couple O
problems O
I O
was O
n't O
aware O
of O
( O
namely O
the O
CD O
drive O
was O
broken O
or O
something O
) O
and O
now O
the O
laptop O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

even O
some O
honest O
" O
Wow O

" O
responses O
when O
I O
took O
this O
to O
the O
library O
. O

The O
sound O
was O
not O
effected O
and O
with O
a O
little O
work O
I O
was O
able O
to O
pop O
it O
back O
, O
though O
it O
seemed O
like O
the O
material O
could O
easily O
be O
ripped O
. O

If O
you O
're O
thinking O
that O
this O
will O
be O
crystal O
clear O
, O
do O
n't O
get O
your O
hopes O
up O
. O

The O
USB O
wireless O
stick O
tucks O
nicely O
into O
the O
speakers O
when O
not O
in O
use.-It O
has O
been O
pretty O
much O
plug O
- O
and O
- O
play O
( O
albeit O
with O
some O
Bluetooth O
settings O
, O
audio O
out O
settings O
, O
whatever O
your O
machine O
requires).-The O
rechargeable O
battery O
is O
working O
well.-The O

The O
zippers O
on O
two O
of O
the O
four O
zippered O
compartments O
close O

- O
tight O
. O

Clear O
and O
loud O
. O

It O
's O
a O
perfect O
fit O
over O
the O
monitor O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
away O
from O

When O
his O
laptop O
recently O
ceased O
to O
function O
, O
he O
was O
quick O
to O
purchase O
the O
same O
computer O
I O
had O
for O
himself O
. O

It O
has O
enough O
pockets O
in O
there O
to O
keep O
your O
stuff O
organized O
. O

so O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
number O
pad O
simply O
saves O
space O
. O

A O
great O
value O
for O
the O
money O
which O
should O
last O
a O
long O
time O
! O

The O
cams O
were O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
and O
everything O
that O
you O
needed O
was O
in O
the O
box O
. O

Way O
better O
than O
having O
a O
ton O
of O
wires O
around O
your O
computer O
and O
way O
better O
than O
those O
clunky O
bluetooth O
speakers O
with O
short O
battery O
life O
. O

It O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
switch O
which O
computer O
gets O
the O
scan O
by O
pushing O
the O
button O
on O
top O
of O
the O
switch O
. O

Some O
things O
that O
make O
this O
tablet O
great O
( O
that O
you O
may O
not O
realize O
) O
is O
how O
sturdy O
it O
is O
built O
. O

The O
15 O
inch O
model O
which O
I O
also O
use O
at O
work O
also O
depends O
on O
the O
Intel O
HD4000 O
for O
everything O
on O
the O
OS O
aside O
from O
video O
rendering O
, O
Photoshop O
GPU O
load O
or O
games O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
the O
system O
shows O
pride O
of O
ownership O
and O
the O
savings O
is O
more O
than O
appreciated O
. O

Bought O
this O
chromebook O
for O
my O
12yr O
old O
daughter O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
. O

It O
came O
promptly O
and O
well O
- O
packaged O
and O
is O
definitely O
a O
genuine O
brand O
- O
new O
exact O
replacement O
battery O
for O
my O
mid-2009 O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
I O
installed O
it O
easily O
. O

It O
took O
me O
well O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
the O
damn O
thing O
to O
power O
on O
because O
of O
loose O
wiring O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
's O
somewhat O
of O
a O
crapshoot O
when O
you O
order O
these O
things O
. O

I O
take O
this O
case O
everywhere O

This O
is O
a O
& O
# O
34;bump O
out&#34 O
; O
extra O
capacity O
battery O
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
appear O
to O
be O
embedded O
into O
the O
OS O
architecture O
itself O
, O
so O

Intel O
Core O
i7 O
- O
3610QM O

In O
any O
case O
, O
I O
can O
load O
& O
change O
and O
charge O
both O
the O
32 O
bit O
folders O
and O
the O
64 O
bit O
folders O
on O
their O
respective O
machines O
. O

PRICEI O
got O
this O
Chromebook O
primarily O
for O
my O
wife O
as O
an O
internet O
surfer O
. O

Have O
not O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
camera O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
take O
it O
to O
the O
toilet O
with O
me O
! O

Picked O
up O
my O
home O
network O
the O
minute O
I O
turned O
the O
computer O
on O
. O

So O
far O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
this O
case O
. O

What O
is O
nice O
is O
that O
it O
is O
so O
compact O
. O

There O
are O
two O
side O
pockets O
for O
car O
keys O
, O
cell O
phones O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
'd O
love O
it O
if O
volume O
control O
were O
analog O
, O
and O
there O
's O
no O
warning O
when O
batt O
is O
close O
to O
run O
out O
! O
! O

I O
would O
love O
it O
if O
it O
would O
automatically O
turn O
on O
or O
off O
on O
its O
own O
based O
on O
whether O
there O
was O
music O
going O
through O
it O
or O
whether O
it O
was O
plugged O
in O
. O

It O
took O
up O
more O
space O
than O
it O
did O
originally O
and O
became O
difficult O
to O
comfortable O
fit O
in O
my O
go O
bag O
. O

It O
fit O
my O
15-inch O
laptop O
very O
well O
, O
although O
there O
should O
be O
more O
padding O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
slot O
for O
when O
you O
set O
the O
backpack O
down O
, O
although O
I O
did O
n't O
actually O
have O
any O
problems O
created O
by O
that O
. O

like O
I O
originally O
planned O
, O
I O
'm O
now O
running O
5 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
in O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
only O
supposed O
to O
run O
a O
max O
of O
4 O
GB O
. O

It O
certainly O
does O
not O
replace O
a O
tablet O
feel O
( O
nor O
is O
it O
meant O
to O
so O
no O
stars O
deducted O
) O
. O

Rather O
than O
those O
stupid O
fragile O
and O
hard O
- O
to O
- O
find O
5VDC O
/ O
USB O
cables O
that O
most O
manufacturers O
use O
, O
Cooler O
Master O
adopted O
a O
standard O
USB O
cable O
- O
with O
USB O
connectors O
at O
both O
ends O
! O

If O
you O
're O
not O
sure O
if O
yours O
is O
defective O
, O
you O
can O
test O
them O
with O
an O
inexpensive O
multi O
- O
meter O
. O

Can O
not O
find O
it O
in O
anyway O
or O
can O
I O
even O
get O
into O
the O
menu O
to O
set O
up O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
try O
an O
external O
wired O
ergonomic O
mouse O
. O

The O
webcam O
has O
gone O
drastically O
down O
in O
price O
, O
maybe O
it O
is O
because O
they O
plan O
on O
coming O
out O
with O
a O
newer O
version O
. O

Should O
it O
prove O
to O
be O
reliable O
in O
future O
months O
. O

watch O
my O
favorite O
recorded O
shows O
like O
national O
geographic O
special O
, O
history O
channel O
, O
even O
my O
favorite O
HDTV O
channels O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
pretty O
solidBuild O
: O
The O
computer O
is O
all O
plastic O
. O

( O
that O
's O
what O
my O
iPod O
is O
for O
) O
, O
but O
the O
video O
- O
player O
capability O
, O
though O
hardly O
crucial O
for O
my O
purposes O
, O
makes O
the O
P-3000 O
a O
pretty O
sweet O
and O
versatile O
road O
tool O
. O

If O
you O
throw O
this O
item O
in O
a O
bag O
or O
backpack O
with O
other O
floating O
items O
, O
then O
pens O
or O
such O
can O
poke O
at O
the O
speaker O
and O
ruin O
it O
. O

Cutting O
and O
pasting O
, O
and O
even O
blocking O
are O
difficult O
at O
best O
. O

So O
I O
removed O
both O
the O
drive O
cage O
and O
the O
lower O
bay O
and O
used O
velcro O
to O
mount O
the O
drive O
adapter O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
case O
, O
as O
far O
forward O
as O
I O
could O
get O
it O
. O

To O
make O
matters O
worse O
, O
the O
partitions O
only O
give O
47 O
gb O
of O
usable O
space O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
about O
4 O
hours O
of O
normal O
use O
which O
is O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
to O
also O
have O
Thunderbolt O
, O
as O
it O
looks O
like O
in O

That O
was O
my O
first O
choice O
, O
but O
changed O
my O
mind O
because O
of O
new O
retractable O
design O
from O
Sandisk O
. O

When O
I O
opened O
the O
packaging O
and O
saw O
how O
small O
these O
were O
and O
that O
they O
ran O
on O
only O
3 O
AAA O
batteries O
, O
I O
was O
skeptical O
. O

As O
with O
all O
non O
- O
Dell O
factory O
OEM O
chargers O
some O
laptops O
may O
indicate O
an O
unknown O
charging O
device O
is O
attached O
. O

I O
just O
recently O
purchased O
this O
little O
speaker O
because O
I O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
hear O
my O
videos O
for O
school O
. O

Aside O
from O
those O
two O
problems O
, O
so O
far O
I O
really O
like O
this O
bag O
. O

Once O
the O
old O
drivers O
are O
removed O
insert O
the O
cd O
and O
follow O
the O
onscreen O
prompts O
and O
Bamm O
your O
done O
! O
! O
! O
. O

Maybe O
the O
offset O
pen O
nib O
contributed O
to O
the O
pen O
pivoting O
a O
lot O
in O
my O
hand O
. O

There O
is O
only O
1 O
USB3 O
port O
( O
also O
a O
USB2 O
port O
) O
, O
so O
I O
bought O
a O
7-port O
USB3 O
hub O
and O
now O
have O
lots O
of O
connectivity O
options O
when O
I O
need O
them O
. O

I O
have O
to O
force O
quit O
Safari O
from O
time O
to O
time O
due O
to O
a O
very O
sluggish O
performance O
. O

The O
run O
time O
is O
NEVER O
what O
the O
laptop O
manufacturer O
or O
battery O
maker O
claims O
. O

It O
connected O
quickly O
thru O
wireless O

After O
buying O
it O
, O
my O
computer O
is O
nice O
and O
cool O
, O
even O
after O
long O
use O
on O
my O
lap O
. O

The O
PC O
will O
stop O
recognizing O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
I O
could O
empty O
it O
, O
wipe O
it O
down O

The O
display O
especially O
when O
viewing O
photos O
is O
not O
as O
crisp O
as O
with O
my O
bigger O
laptop O
. O

Once O
you O
get O
it O
to O
work O
, O
however O
, O
it O
works O
great O
. O

IF O
this O
works O
, O
I O
'll O
update O
my O
review O
. O

This O
product O
has O
a O
distinct O
quality O
feel O
. O

If O
you O
're O
using O
it O
in O
a O
room O
it O
will O
be O
fine O
, O
in O
a O
vehicle O
... O
not O
so O
much O
. O

This O
monitor O
was O
a O
gift O
to O
my O
Mother O
that O
was O
unfortunately O
stuck O
with O
an O
old O
Samsung O
monitor O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

and O
I O
was O
afraid O
it O
was O
a O
cooling O
fan O
. O

Everyone O
charges O
too O
much O
for O
power O
adapters O
. O

Also O
, O
this O
item O
was O
not O
as O
described O
. O

The O
corners O
are O
leather O
and O
hold O
the O
kindle O
in O
place O
well O
. O

These O
cords O
burn O
out O
easily O
and O
quickly O
( O
6 O
- O
9 O
months O
) O
but O
they O
are O
much O
cheaper O
than O
the O
name O
brand O
option O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
GNS5870 O
and O
was O
bit O
dissapointed O
with O
it O
. O

Great O
service O
and O
fast O
at O
a O
good O
price O
... O

They O
were O
recognized O
immediately O
and O
I O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
since O
. O

ok O
this O
cooling O
fan O
is O
very O
quiet O
almost O
ca O
n't O
hear O
it O
. O

0 O

I O
really O
like O
the O
Blue O
look O
, O
it O
fits O
good O
, O
does O
n't O
ever O
slip O
off O
and O
protects O
the O
outside O
. O

The O
keyboard O
cover O
fits O
nicely O
but O
the O
colored O
key O
letters O
does O
n't O
match O
up O
right O
with O
the O
keyboard O
key O
letters O
which O
is O
only O
an O
issue O
when O
the O
light O
is O
passing O
through O
it O
. O

I O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
stop O
my O
laptop O
from O
BSOD O
, O
and O
I O
use O
the O
adapter O
on O
my O
wife O
's O
laptop O
, O
and O
my O
trusty O
old O
built O

" O
. O

Use O
it O
with O
my O
iPad O
Mini O
. O

So O
enough O
of O
the O
negatives O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
thing O
is O
simply O
not O
a O
productivity O
tool O
unless O
you O
can O
work O
around O
its O
shortcomings O
( O
which O
I O
could O
not O
do).The O
screen O
is O
gorgeous O
in O
coloration O
, O
however O
whatever O
you O
gain O
in O
viewing O
angles O
from O
it O
being O
an O
IPS O
screen O
, O
you O
lose O
a O
lot O
more O
due O
to O
its O
reflectivity O
. O

I O
love O
that O
it O
's O
a O
hard O
case O
so O
that O
it O
protects O
my O
Passport O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
also O
purchased O
an O
in O
the O
ear O
version O
( O
no O
plastic O
over O
the O
ear O
) O
. O

Its O
just O
annoying O
to O
hav O
eto O
dedicate O
2 O
USB O
ports O
to O
this O
guy O
if O
1 O
does O
nt O
supply O
enough O
power O
. O

everything O
else O
works O
well O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
slide O
the O
laptop O
across O
a O
fabric O
without O
it O
catching O
on O
stuff O
and O
dislodging O
the O
battery O
. O

The O
USB O
receiver O
can O
be O
tucked O
into O
the O
mouse O
, O
which O
is O
another O
good O
design O
point O
. O

it O
's O
even O
kind O
of O
pretty O
in O

I O
have O
experienced O
lag O
and O
installation O
headaches O
with O
other O
brands O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
anyways O
since O
I O
desperately O
needed O
broadband O
in O
my O
area O
and O
hoped O
for O
the O
best O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
minimize O
to O
System O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
design O
and O
color O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
rubbery O
feeling O
really O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
slick O
glossy O
either O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
to O
type O
like O
a O
beginner O
. O

It O
looked O
durable O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

this O
item O
works O
great O
, O
this O
was O
ship O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
it O
take O
long O
to O
get O
here O
about O
a O
week O
, O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
generic O
drivers O
down O
the O
toshiba O
bluetooth O
stack&#34 O
; O
premium O
edition O
do O
a O
google O
search O
to O
down O
load O
it O
, O
u O
transfer O
files O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
transfer O
file O
about O
83k O
, O
some O
ppl O
, O
might O
able O
to O
go O
faster O
, O
highly O
recommended O
, O
thx O
again O
for O
the O
item O

The O
USB O
connector O
portion O
of O
the O
dongle O
is O
slightly O
elongated O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
protrude O
from O
_ O
flush O
_ O
USB O
ports O
slightly O
. O

However O
, O
it O
requires O
that O
you O
bring O
your O
own O
peripherals O
, O
storage O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
and O
it O
runs O
a O
very O
modified O
version O
of O
Linux O
operating O
system O
. O

I O
was O
reluctant O
to O
pay O
Apple O
the O
$ O
128 O
they O
want O
for O
a O
new O
one O

I O
took O
it O
straight O
to O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
and O
paid O
the O
$ O
15 O
for O
install O
. O

So O
I O
mostly O
just O
disable O
the O
mouse O
/ O
touch O
pad O
on O
the O
keyboard O
and O
just O
stay O
with O
touch O
screen O
control O
. O

After O
doing O
# O
1 O
and O
setting O
up O
my O
wireless O
connection O
everything O
looks O
good O
. O

The O
special O
effect O
filters O
do O
n't O
work O
on O
resolutions O
720p O
and O
1080p O
and O
barely O
work O
on O
480p O
. O

I O
chose O
to O
pick O
it O
up O
rather O
than O

hibernate.)"Express O
Gate O
" O
is O
FAST O

, O
so O
she O
has O
full O
versions O
of O
the O
basics O
( O
AV O
, O
Outlook O
, O
Word O
, O
Excel O
, O
Access O
, O
Powerpoint O
, O
Publisher O
, O
etc O
) O
installed O
for O
very O
little O
money O
out O
of O
pocket O
. O

Windows O
7 O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
get O
started O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
wireless O
LAN O
setup O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
wireless O
activation O
key O
. O

it O
works O
like O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
. O

like O
I O
carry O

Thanks O
guys O
! O

so O
these O
replacement O
cords O
are O
a O
great O
value O
and O
work O
perfectly O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
be O
doing O
much O
photo O
editing O
as O
color O
/ O
exposure O
is O
concerned O
without O
an O
external O
monitor O
. O

This O
works O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
there O
is O
only O
small O
amount O
of O
Tablet O
optimized O
apps O
as O
of O
now O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
like O
most O
apps O
work O
with O
the O
Tablet O
anyway O
. O

The O
memory O
is O
an O
upgrade O
from O
the O
stock O
2 O
GB O
to O
4 O
GB O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
needs O
this O
specific O
charger O
. O

I O
received O
the O
item O
in O
good O
order O
from O
Amazon O
. O

: O
First O
thing O
to O
know O
, O
it O
is O
a O
sealed O
battery O
, O
there O
is O
no O
removable O
battery O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
things O
I O
like O
about O
the O
tablet O
is O
that O
it O
's O
powered O
by O
USB O
, O
unlike O
the O
previous O
Wacom O
tablet O

Exactly O
what O
I O
ordered O
! O

but O
I O
'm O
hoping O
it O
's O
an O
additional O
input O
for O
other O
video O
equipment O
. O

Then O
the O
area O
in O
the O
back O
ia O
good O
for O
papers O
or O
other O
small O
things O
, O
but O
the O
front O
compartment O
is O
my O
favorite O
part O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
resting O
your O
feet O
on O
it O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
ask O
you O
to O
move O
it O
you O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

Also O
luckily O
, O
her O
laptop O
was O
n't O
injured O
. O

The O
quality O
will O
not O
blow O
you O
away O
but O
at O
the O
price O
, O
one O
ca O
n't O
complain O
. O

Summary O
: O
I've O
owned O
this O
bag O
for O
some O
months O
now O
. O

I O
actually O
like O

The O
HP O
DV6700 O
line O
of O
notebooks O
is O
an O
update O
to O
the O
DV6000 O
line O
. O

So O
when O
I O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
get O
this O
Caselogic O
briefcase O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
resist O
. O

what O
so O
ever O
with O
this O
dock O

If O
you O
are O
a O
consultant O
and O
you O
have O
nosey O
clients O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
first O
time O
I O
turned O
on O
the O
Mini O
Touch O
, O
I O
was O
surprised O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
touch O
pad O
, O
I O
have O
a O
trackball O
which O
I O
use O
on O
the O
right O
side O
, O
where O
I O
am O
constantly O
bumping O
into O
the O
headphone O
plug O
- O
in O
. O

Okay O
so O
after O
a O
few O
months O
of O
use O
, O
and O
purchase O
ANOTHER O
1 O
- O
I O
must O
admit O
, O
these O
Sharkk O
's O
are O
fantastic O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
screen O
does O
a O
good O
job O
of O
staying O
where O
you O
set O
it O
and O
not O
sliding O
down O
toward O
the O
closed O
position O
. O

My O
hand O
accidentally O
hits O
the O
pad O
and O
makes O
the O
cursor O
jump O
around O
. O

However O
, O
this O
chill O
mat O
is O
best O
for O
laptops O
where O
the O
cooling O
vent O
is O
on O
the O
side O
( O
which O
is O
why O
it O
was O
a O
preferable O
product O
for O
Toshiba's).My O
Laptop O
is O
14 O
- O
15 O
" O
. O

I O
take O
it O
with O
me O
to O
lunch O
and O
can O
listen O
to O
my O
favorite O
tunes O
with O
my O
friends O
, O
outside O
. O

I O
have O
encountered O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
with O
the O
" O
mura O
effect O
" O
also O
called O
" O
clouding O

I O
charged O
it O
over O
night O
before O
using O
it O
. O

the O
DVD O
's O
were O
easily O
watchable O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
a O
spare O
mini O
- O
USB O
cable O
, O
which O
is O
odd O
given O
less O
and O
less O
devices O
use O
this O
. O

Even O
the O
slightest O
touch O
will O
send O
Chrome O
to O
a O
new O
tab O
or O
erase O
the O
screen O
. O

; O
HDD O
from O
a O
Mac O
Mini O
. O

The O
camera O
feels O
good O
in O
my O
hand O
. O

It O
's O
a O
hot O
swappable O
device O
with O
plug O
and O
play O
feature O
. O

Mind O
you O
, O
many O
desktop O
computers O
have O
a O
similar O
baseplate O
mounting O
scheme O
, O
so O
this O
case O
should O
be O
fine O
for O
stationary O
use O
. O

laptop O
, O
but O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
the O
sacrifice O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
the O
net O
book O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O
a O
DVI O
> O
HDMI O
cable O
was O
superior O
to O
a O
VGA O
cable O
, O
I O
ordered O
this O
product O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
looks O
at O
all O
then O
it O
should O
make O
you O
happy O
enough O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Shipping O
is O
free O
and O
very O
fast O
, O
so O
I O
give O
it O
another O
star O
. O

Mitigated O
a O
bit O
by O
the O
nearly O
instant O
on O
/ O
off O
cycle O
of O
the O
Pixel O
. O

Will O
it O
ever O
work O
again O
? O

Almost O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
. O

ft O
length O
and O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

It O
goes O
back O
to O
my O
vendor O
tomorrow O
. O

You O
have O
a O
zippered O
compartment O
in O
the O
flap O
( O
great O
to O
store O
a O
laptop O
's O
charging O
/ O
power O
cord O
) O
, O
a O
' O
desk O
' O
once O
you O
unzip O
the O
panel O
under O
the O
flap O
( O
before O
you O
unzip O
there O
is O
storage O
for O
3 O
pens O
) O

Works O
perfectly O
with O
the O
PSP O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
quite O
a O
few O
tips O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
plugs O
for O
your O
appliances O
remain O
tight O
when O
plugged O
into O
this O
adapter O
. O

I O
am O
taking O
a O
6-hour O
flight O
to O
Hawaii O
soon O
and O
will O
use O
the O
internal O
battery O
on O
my O
laptop O
to O
about O
10 O
% O
, O
then O
I O
will O
plug O
in O
the O
XP18000 O
to O
avoid O
losing O
power O
twice O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
would O
need O
to O
bring O
in O
bolt O
cutters O
or O
another O
tool O
. O

You O
only O
need O
to O
tap O
the O
touchpad O
with O
one O
finger O
for O
a O
left O
click O
. O

Only O
good O
thing O
is O
that O
their O
customer O
service O
is O
located O
in O
United O
States O
! O

My O
Passport O
Essential O

. O
0 O

and O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
it O
's O
completely O
worth O
EVERY O
penny O
. O

good O
product O
and O
as O
described O
. O

This O
all O
seems O
great O
after O
my O
experience O
trying O
the O
$ O
20 O
batteries O
also O
available O
on O
Amazon O
-- O
2 O
of O
them O
. O

And O
I O
live O
in O
Brazil O
and O
my O
country O
is O
not O
part O
of O
GSM O
. O

I O
've O
honestly O
never O
had O
that O
happen O
with O
any O
of O
my O
other O
HP O
's O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
a O
model O
- O
specific O
thing O
. O

If O
you O
can O
find O
a O
skin O
to O
put O
around O
the O
keyboard O
/ O
touchpad O
, O
that O
'll O
fix O
the O
finger O
- O
print O
issue O
. O

I O
previously O
tried O
Corsair O
's O
Value O
Select O
RAM O
with O
the O
same O
specs O
, O
however O
, O
I O
kept O
having O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

Installation O
was O
as O
simple O
as O
plugging O
it O
in O
and O
then O
using O
the O
display O
setting O
to O
tell O
XP O
to O
use O
the O
second O
display O
as O
the O
extended O
desktop O
. O

I O
bought O
2 O
of O
these O
to O
use O
at O
home O
and O
work O
. O

The O
full O
HD O
17 O
" O
monitor O
is O
capable O
of O
movie O
standard O
graphics O
and O
it O
can O
display O
3D O
graphics O
in O
a O
native O
Asus O
3D O
mode O
, O
( O
glasses O
required O
for O
best O
results O
) O
. O

Its O
fast O
and O
no O
noticably O
bugs O
. O

It O
is O
kinda O
annoying O
, O
but O
it O
still O
works O
as O
designed O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
more O
than O
does O
the O
job O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
waste O
if O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
fix O
my O
problem.[UPDATE O

Tapping O
and O
scrolling O
through O
web O
pages O
is O
nice O
and O
you O
can O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
simple O
productivity O
work O
entirely O
in O
Metro O
. O

I O
happen O
to O
have O
anHP O
Pavilion O
dv9330us O
, O
which O
is O
not O
only O
a O
perfect O
match O
to O
the O
dock O
, O
but O
also O
looks O
like O
it O
belongs O
style O
- O
wise O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
that O
I O
could O
easily O
carry O
around O
to O
class O
or O
friend O
's O
rooms O
for O
writing O
reports O
or O
facebook O
browsing O

simply O
having O
the O

while O
doing O
homework O
( O
wolframalpha O
and O
chegg O
, O
to O
name O
a O
few O
) O
. O

Screen O
was O
nice O
. O

The O
hardware O
in O
this O
thing O
is O
top O

The O
only O
negatives O
I O
really O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
are O
; O

I O
have O
n't O
watched O
any O
movies O
or O
DVD O

yet O
( O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
CD\DVD O
drive O
but O
will O
get O
one O
, O
along O
with O
a O
USB O
HDD O
and O
the O
upgrade O
to O
2 O
GB O
memory).A O
few O
days O
later O
: O
I O
found O
the O
state O
of O
charge O
indicator O
in O
the O
toolbar O
( O
it O
was O
in O
a O
' O
hidden O
' O

) O
and O
brought O
it O
up O
so O
I O
can O
see O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Another O
battery O
works O
fine.(The O
seller O
responded O
to O
my O
inquiry O
with O
minutes O
with O
a O
prepaid O
return O
label O
! O

The O
inside O
compartments O
are O
either O
orange O
or O
grey O
nylon O
lined O

and O
there O
's O
a O
small O
, O
tasteful O
, O
orange O
fabric O
accent O
that O
might O
help O
confusing O
your O
bags O
with O
all O
the O
other O
black O
bags O
on O
a O
plane O
. O

Plus O
a O
wifi O

would O
be O
a O
one O
time O
investment O
. O

Not O
much O
else O
to O
say O
other O
than O
now O
I O
can O
use O
my O
printer O
without O
having O
to O
rearrange O
my O
home O
office O
. O

I O
actually O
bought O
this O
computer O
from O
a O
reletive O
but O
came O
here O
to O
check O
reviews O
first O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
here O
are O
my O
findings O
: O

It O
's O
not O
designed O
to O
be O
a O
gpu O
powerhouse O
but O
it O
handles O
most O
games O
pretty O
well O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

Wire O
on O
this O
one O
enables O
flexibility O
. O

With O
the O
light O
coming O
from O
behind O
, O
most O
webcams O
show O
very O
dark O
pictures O
. O

There O
is O
a O
compartment O
underneath O
for O
storing O
the O
USB O
power O
cable O
during O
travel O
. O

The O
micro O
- O
USB O
end O
fits O
the O
phone O
's O
charging O
port O
very O
securely O
( O
even O
more O
so O
than O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
phone O
when O
it O
was O
brand O
new O
) O
. O

I O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
replace O
my O
old O
laptop O
battery O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
was O
a O
little O
low O
on O
funds O
. O

There O
's O
enough O
space O
in O
that O
compartment O
to O
also O
hold O
my O
iPad O
in O
its O
case O
and O
carrying O
case O
, O
with O
room O
to O
spare O
. O

Though O
leather O
, O
very O
light O
weight O
, O
does O
not O
detract O
from O
original O
purpose O
of O
the O
light O
unit O
and O
reason O
why O
I O
bought O
a O
kindle O
( O
already O
own O
an O
IPAD O
) O
. O

WTF!!!!If O
not O
for O
the O
good O
dea O
and O
the O
good O
looks O

In O
all O
the O
key O
areas O
, O
however O
, O
the O
VAIO O
Pro O
oozes O
quality O
, O
and O
Sony O
has O
clearly O
been O
hard O
at O
work O
improving O
on O
the O
VAIO O
Z O
Series O
' O
ergonomics O
. O

It O
streamed O
just O
fine O
from O
other O
sources O
( O
HBO O
GO O
, O
for O
instance O
) O

I O
have O
a O
Chromebook O
, O
and O
I O
bought O
this O
to O
protect O
the O
keyboard O
and O
make O
cleaning O
it O
easier O
. O

Although O
the O
adhesive O
is O
only O
on O
the O
outer O
edge O
, O
I O
did O
not O
know O
and O
was O
not O
notified O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
screen O
protector O
did O
not O
have O
a O
plastic O
layer O
, O
thus O
leaving O
my O
own O
fingerprints O
immediately O
when O
I O
opened O
the O
package O
. O

The O
battery O
replacement O
experience O
can O
be O
very O
frustrating O
but O
this O
one O
is O
a O
keeper O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

My O
2-year O
old O
Samsung O
Series O
9 O
developed O
a O
problem O
that O
many O
others O
also O
report O
, O
a O
crack O
developed O
for O
no O
reason O
at O
the O
upper O
left O
of O
the O
main O
surface O
area O
and O
as O
a O
result O
the O
power O
input O
can O
no O
longer O
hold O
the O
charger O
plug O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
little O
bulkier O
to O
carry O
around O
, O
but O
for O
me O
personally O
I O
love O
the O
extra O
size O
. O

Sound O
quality O
is O
very O
good O
for O
small O
speakers O
. O

The O
pin O
is O
actually O
5 O
shards O
coming O
to O
a O
point O
with O
each O
shard O
suspect O
to O
bending O
if O
not O
careful O
. O

Easily O
replaced O
for O
just O
a O
dollar O
or O
two O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
back O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
as O
again O
. O

When O
the O
lid O
is O
closed O
, O
you O
kinda O
have O
to O
look O
under O
to O
see O
them O
. O

I O
will O
RMA O
this O
and O
see O
if O
the O
replacement O
works O
. O

Great O
for O
the O
tablet O
... O
that O
I O
brought O
my O
husband O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
loud O
enough O
to O
comfortable O
listen O
to O
the O
dialog O
from O
a O
movie O
or O
TV O
show O
. O

The O
mic O
quality O
is O
a O
little O
distant O
sounding O
however O
so O
be O
aware O
you O
have O
to O
move O
closer O
to O
it O
when O
talking O
. O

Three O
sides O
are O
made O
of O
plastic O
but O
the O
rest O
is O
made O
of O
metal O
. O

I O
've O
always O
thought O
highly O
of O
Thule O
products O
( O
roof O
racks O
in O
particular O
) O
and O
this O
does O
n't O
disappoint O
. O

The O
old O
battery O
would O
get O
so O
hot O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
use O
it O
in O
my O
lap O
. O

but O
I O
still O
use O
it O
, O

I O
dothis O
because O
my O
on O
- O
board O
audio O
broke O
, O
but O
the O
front O
slot O
did O
not O
. O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
risk O
. O

My O
U2 O
has O
done O
a O
good O
job O
of O
preventing O
nearly O
all O
such O
events O
. O

In O
my O
experience O
with O
laptop O
computer O
targeted O
cards O
of O
this O
nature O
( O
going O
back O
to O
PCMCIA O
) O
, O
this O
is O
fairly O
common O
-- O
only O
a O
few O
systems O
have O
a O
tab O
that O
comes O
out O
to O
hold O
a O
card O
in O
place O
, O
and O
even O
in O
those O
the O
tab O
is O
usually O
meant O
as O
an O
anti O
- O
theft O
device O
instead O
of O
a O
device O
stability O
feature O
; O
pulling O
something O
out O
of O
a O
card O
is O
about O
as O
likely O
to O
remove O
the O
card O
as O
to O
leave O
the O
card O
in O
place O
. O

I O
also O
want O
to O
note O
that O
the O
peripherals O
responded O
as O
soon O
as O
this O
was O
plugged O
into O
my O
desktop O
, O
and O
maintained O
connection O
even O
when O
my O
desktop O
restarted O
and O
was O
going O
through O
bios O
settings O
. O

My O
laptop O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
it O
could O
handle O
all O
this O
stuff O

This O
is O
pretty O
darn O
good O
considering O
the O
tools O
this O
notebook O
provides O
. O

The O
Kensington O
system O
costs O
a O
little O
more O
money O
, O
but O
it O
is O
definitely O
worth O
it O
. O

However O
, O
once O
you O
get O
over O
this O
problem O
, O
ther O
are O
no O
issues O
with O
control O
. O

It O
is O
such O
a O
short O
seeing O
and O
poor O
" O
economy O
" O
on O
the O
manufacture O
's O
side O
! O

Fortunately O
this O
was O
a O
change O
that O
I O
could O
wait O
for O
. O

Problem O
is O
, O
once O
all O
the O
updates O
were O
done O
, O
it O
naturally O
wanted O
to O
reboot O
-- O
and O
it O
almost O
never O
turned O
back O
on O
! O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
satisfied O
with O
the O
unit O
primarily O
due O
to O
the O
performance O
specs O
and O
the O
price O
. O

After O
I O
returned O
it O
to O
the O
Apple O
Store O
, O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
iPad O
stand O
was O
on O
a O
table O
that O
was O
crooked O
when O
more O
weight O
was O
applied O
to O
it O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
expecting O
it O
to O
give O
me O
a O
fast O
boot O
up O
speed O
after O
a O
few O
reboots O
. O

With O
this O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
choose O
between O
the O
power O
cord O
or O
the O
USB O
; O
or O
the O
earphones O
or O
the O
USB O
. O

; O
no O
cables O
, O
no O
adapters O
, O
no O
jumpers O
, O
no O
fuss O
! O

I O
get O
almost O
3 O
hours O
of O
use O
now O
from O
the O
laptop O
before O
the O
notification O
that O
I O
should O
recharge O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
camera O
now O
for O
about O
10 O
days O

( O
home O
) O
, O
since O
I O
would O
like O
to O
use O

Internet O
speed O
when O
I O
use O
wired O
connection O
is O
20Mbps O

and O
then O
I O
was O
flying O
on O
the O
interwebs O
instantly O
. O

Nice O
quality O
and O
great O
price O
. O

and O
they O
run O
much O
cooler O
with O
this O
fan O
. O

Received O
the O
item O
quickly O
, O
plugged O
it O
in O
, O
and O
nothing O
. O

Can O
use O
on O
systems O
that O
do O
n't O
have O
floppy O
drives O
. O

The O
inside O
of O
the O
sleeve O
is O
a O
faux O
fur O
- O
type O
of O
lining O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
since O
I O
know O
it O
wo O
n't O
scratch O
my O
screen O
. O

They O
told O
me O
my O
Macbook O
parts O
are O
from O
2010 O
. O

I O
purchased O
these O
for O
those O
photos O
and O
documents O
that O
I O
want O
to O
share O
with O
friends O
without O
worrying O
if O
I O
get O
my O
drive O
back O
, O
I O
have O
been O
using O
these O
for O
that O
purpose O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
on O
Windows O
or O
Mac O
OS O
. O

like O
I O
would O
usually O
do O
to O
test O
it O
out O

my O
kids O
have O
ipads O
from O
their O
school O
, O
I O
believe O
they O
are O
ipad O

I O
forget O
it O
runs O
on O
batteries O
actually O
. O

They O
are O
rubber O
, O
and O
the O
grip O
is O
so O
strong O
it O
sort O
of O
pulls O
all O
the O
weight O
on O
one O
small O
spot O
where O
it O
grabs O
, O
instead O
of O
distributing O
it O
over O
a O
larger O
area O
. O

I O
've O
had O
it O
since O
high O
school O
( O
12 O
+ O
years O
) O
and O
it O
is O
still O
going O
strong O
. O

As O
a O
Windows O
operator O
since O
the O
Windows O
1 O

0 O
inception O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
steep O
learning O
curve O
. O

Minor O
inconvenience O
. O

Multiple O
issues O
developed O
after O
one O
year O
: O
not O
just O
the O
power O
cord O
, O
but O
screen O
backlight O
started O
dimming O
in O
particular O
areas O
and O
the O
keyboard O
and O
built O
- O
in O
mouse O
" O
clicker O
" O
starting O
wearing O
out O
. O

I O
keep O
calling O
them O
speakers O
, O
even O
though O
it O
is O
physically O
just O
one O
speaker O
. O

Mine O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
HP O
drive O
internally O
, O
not O
a O
Panasonic O
like O
the O
description O
says O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
mine O
. O

That O
is O
one O
of O
those O
features O
you O
might O
not O
see O
yourself O
using O
, O
then O
really O
missing O
when O
using O
another O
mouse O
. O

Then O
, O
I O
looked O
at O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
reviews O
this O
thing O
's O
received O
. O

Tablet O

While O
this O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
if O
you O
want O
to O
listen O
to O
one O
track O
over O
and O
over O
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
any O
musician O
trying O
to O
learn O
a O
song O
. O

I O
have O
better O
luck O
just O
using O
a O
wedge O
at O
the O
back O
of O
my O
computer O
to O
lift O
it O
up O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
in O
Afaghanistan O
to O
receive O
the O
AFN O
signal O
. O

It O
still O
had O
room O
. O

When O
it O
started O
failing O
mid O
- O
day O
. O

You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Since O
all O
of O
our O
other O
devices O
were O
connecting O
to O
the O
router O
without O
any O
problems O
, O
I O
figured O
that O
the O
problem O
was O
my O
adapter O
. O

You O
want O
the O
application O
because O
this O
chip O
allows O
for O
WIDI O
& O
MY O
WIFI O
technology O
. O

I O
'm O
always O
amazed O
at O
how O
much O
equipment O
I O
can O
fit O
into O
this O
bag O
. O

No O
backup O
rubber O
plugs O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
' O
professional O
' O
photographer O
, O
but O
do O
plenty O
of O
photo O
editing O
. O

I O
shopped O
for O
this O
product O
at O
several O
retail O
and O
home O
shopping O
networks O
and O
by O
far O
your O
price O
was O
the O
best O
. O

Sure O
, O
laptop O
is O
a O
little O
damaged O
, O
but O
the O
guy O
who O
just O
stole O
yours O
does O
n't O
care O
one O
bit O
. O

Could O
only O
give O
it O
4 O
stars O
for O
Configurability O
because O
the O
guest O
account O
can O
only O
be O
managed O
with O
software O
and O
not O
through O
the O
web O
interface O
but O
that O
is O
a O
small O
quibble O
. O

THis O
case O
fits O
well O
and O
looks O
good O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
big O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
beautiful O
and O
the O
hardware O
is O
impossible O
to O
beat O
for O
the O
price O
. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
neoprene O
case O
which O
I O
can O
still O
use O
with O
my O
tablet O
. O

I O
had O
doubts O
that O
it O
might O
not O
work O
with O
my O
specific O
laptop O
model O
because O
it O
's O
a O
CTO O
( O
Custom O
To O
Order O
) O
but O
it O
does O
, O
so O

Due O
to O
the O
increased O
size O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
fully O
open O
the O
screen O
. O

There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
pockets O
on O
the O
unit O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
the O
bulk O
that O
having O
a O
lot O
of O
pockets O
created O
. O

I O
have O
done O
an O
XP O
/Vista O
comparision O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mind O
a O
road O
machine O
that O
is O
a O
little O
thicker O
if O
it O
is O
more O
capable O
& O
reliable O
. O

Instead O
it O
requires O
a O
bit O
more O
effort O
to O
insure O
that O
I O
'm O
hitting O
the O
button O
and O
making O
good O
contact O
with O
it O
. O

and O
I O
've O
finally O
found O
a O
keeper O
! O

I O
sent O
this O
back O
and O
got O
a O
refund O
. O

.... O
we O
also O
realized O
that O
our O
charger O
was O
not O
working O
either O
because O
it O
was O
missing O
the O
pin O
.... O
but O
that O
's O
another O
review O
... O

My O
previous O
Sony O
had O
the O
screen O
die O
and O
the O
one O
before O
that O
the O
fans O
went O
out O
. O

But O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
. O

Finally O
found O
battery O
removal O
is O
the O
solution O
to O
revive O
it O
with O
power O
adapter O
all O
the O
time O
. O

This O
laptop O
bag O
is O
nicely O
designed O
and O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
affordable O
price O
. O

Before O
I O
forget O
, O
remember O
that O
while O
surfing O
the O
Web O
, O
you O
can O
use O
Ctrl O
+ O
and O
- O
to O
increase O
not O
just O
font O
size O
, O
but O
the O
size O
of O
the O
entire O
page O
. O

Oh O
and O
I O
just O
picked O
up O
this O
little O
cam O
. O

Perfect O
to O
use O
for O
those O
one O
time O
installs O
. O

She O
likes O
the O
blue O
color O
, O
it O
fits O
her O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
brand O
and O
would O
definitely O
purchase O
any O
other O
cable O
manufactured O
by O
this O
brand O
BlueRigger O
. O

This O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
everything O
I O
had O
hoped O
for O
. O

Things O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
... O
- O

Probably O
no O
difference O
at O
all O
if O
it O
was O
inside O
a O
laptop O
. O

Grounded O
, O
surge O
protection O
on O
the O
go O

I O

otherwise O

correctly O
in O

and O
other O
standard O
Mac O

. O

At O
65 O
dollars O
, O
though O
, O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
unnecessary O
( O
and O
slightly O
wonky O
) O
device O
for O
a O
very O
limited O
and O
particular O
user O
base O
. O

They O
worked O
fine O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
devices O
including O
a O
multiport O

and O
a O
CPAP O

( O

I O
love O

The O
interesting O
thing O
for O
me O
is O
that O
this O
sleeve O
seems O
like O
it O
is O
almost O
made O
for O
the O
Asus O
G73 O
. O

and O
though O
I O
have O
several O
external O
keyboards O
, O
I O
want O
a O
laptop O
that O
I O
can O
use O
on O
the O

" O
as O
is O
" O
) O

I O
see O
the O
devices O
there O
in O
the O

but O
ca O
n't O
quite O
poke O
them O
into O
wakefulness O

BUY O
A O

DEVICE O
FOR O
EACH O
ITEM O

However O
, O
they O
did O
not O
provide O
any O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
install O
the O
new O

. O

The O
infrared O
remote O
control O
is O
single O
speed O
zoom O
, O
not O
varible O
. O

As O
to O
the O
shift O
key O
, O
it O
is O
technically O
right O
where O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
-- O
at O
the O
far O
right O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
life O
of O
your O
laptop O
, O
there O
will O
be O
some O
damage O
and O
hopefully O
this O
feature O
protects O
it O
. O

I O
rapidly O
got O
used O
to O
sliding O
between O
desktops O
and O
shuffling O
windows O
around O
. O

( O
I O
have O
n't O
tried O
that O
yet.)The O
way O
the O
cover O
folds O
to O
allow O
this O
case O
to O
become O
a O
stand O
is O
only O
ok O
. O

There O
is O
no O
limitation O
on O
available O
apps O
and O
the O
Transformer O

" O
Clevo O
, O
Sager O
9170em O
, O
that O
I O
received O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
. O

I O
realized O
when O
I O
purchased O
this O
computer O
that O
it O
may O
not O
be O
what O
I O
needed O
, O
but O
it O
was O
what O
I O
could O
afford O
. O

Throughout O
the O
entire O
unboxing O
process O
as O
well O
as O
installation O
to O
the O
iPad O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
Airbender O
felt O
very O
, O
very O
solid O
. O

5A O
is O
not O
enough O
current O
to O
charge O
. O

Fit O
fine O
, O
works O
fine O
, O
did O
n't O
look O
that O
much O
different O
from O
the O
OEM O
fan O
that O
I O
removed O
. O

This O
was O
a O
refurbished O
unit O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
very O
pleased O
indeed O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
performance O
of O
the O
machine O
. O

So O
far O
this O
device O
is O
working O
great O
for O
me O
, O
has O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
use O
with O
both O
DVDs O
and O
BluRays O

I O
hate O
this O
thing O
- O
it O
's O
promising O
to O
be O
slow O
and O
inappropriate O
- O
a O
ripoff O
. O

So O
I O
think O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
save O
my O
money O
this O
time O
and O
upgrade O
to O
something O
better O
. O

Works O
well O
, O
only O
issue O
is O
that O
the O
curled O
power O
wireis O
a O
little O
short O
for O
my O
auto O
and O
pulls O
the O
IPhone O
down O
. O

Yes O
.. O
the O
two O
little O
screws O
that O
hold O
the O
handle O
on O
need O
to O
be O
looked O
at O
periodically O
to O
be O
sure O
they O
stay O
put O
.. O
the O
twisting O
makes O
them O
come O
loose O
. O

partitionsI O
use O
it O
for O
my O
home O
, O
for O
a O
computer O
that O
is O
too O
far O
away O
for O
my O
D O
- O
Link O
extreme O
router O
, O
because O
is O
an O
old O
laptop O
that O
our O
house O
keeper O
( O
Maid O
) O
uses O
. O

I O
had O
card O
failure O
once O
, O
so O
now O
I O
use O
a O
2 O
GB O
or O
a O
4 O
GB O
card O
, O
and O
transfer O
everything O
to O
my O
computer O
, O
and O
external O

, O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

After O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
I O
've O
found O
the O
V850 O
series O
to O
be O
more O
then O
adequate O
for O
my O
system O
holding O
an O
i7/16gb O

As O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
, O
this O
is O
the O
ultimate O
laptop O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
i O
have O
n't O
even O
scratched O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
functionality O
of O
this O
tab O
. O

At O
least O
they O
fit O
better O
and O
there O
is O
no O
issue O
with O
the O
hinge O
opening O

Aside O
from O
the O
problems O
I O
've O
mentioned O
, O
mine O
arrived O
damaged O
so O
i O
am O
shipping O
it O
back O
for O
a O
refund O
and O
will O
go O
another O
direction O

The O

are O
really O
annoying O
and O
the O
Zagg O

does O
n't O
really O
attenuate O

very O
much O

the O

I O
bought O
it O
for O

was O
easy O
just O
plug O

, O
I O
love O
not O

I O
do O
n't O

it O
is O

for O

to O
be O
sealed O
in O
this O
manner O

needed O
a O

When O
I O
switch O

I O
just O
unplug O
the O

I O
am O
good O

it O
is O

in O

the O

is O

and O
the O

In O

the O

The O
performance O
is O

lags O
well O
behind O
even O
my O
older O

let O
alone O
the O

, O
and O
the O

Given O
the O
price O
, O
I O
can O
recommend O
these O

without O

While O
the O

is O
very O
durable O

for O
this O

too O

to O
take O
when O
doing O

trips O
with O
the O

The O
only O
real O
issue O
I O
had O

In O
my O
opinion O
this O
is O
something O
that O
every O
MacBook O
Pro O
owner O
should O
have O
. O

Sorry O
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
plug O
and O
play O

No O
problems O
after O
two O
months O
of O
use O
. O

The O
customer O
rep O
assigned O
to O
this O
particular O
" O

" O
was O
very O
accomodating O
, O
and O
provided O
me O
with O
a O
replacement O

even O
after O

30-day O
trial O
period O

expired O
. O

The O
red O

Her O
only O
complaint O
was O
that O
the O

had O
an O
odor O
to O
it O
. O

I O
say O
thisbecause O

I O
also O
own O
a O
Microsoft O
Surface O
that O
has O
a O
terrific O
touchscreen O

I O
ve O
purchase O
this O
item O
for O
my O
new O

top O
computer O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
this O
mini O
keyboard O
is O
better O
than O
I O
expected O
to O
be O

I O
also O
could O
not O
hook O
these O

no O

sufficient O
padding O

It O
is O
fast O

with O
a O
nice O
non O
glare O
screen O
and O
the O
keyboard O
is O
easy O
to O
type O
on O

I O
use O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
but O
the O
built O
in O
one O
works O

adjusted O
exactly O

I O
wanted O
it O

In O
the O
next O

after O
6hrs O

only O
then O

you O

the O

the O

uncharged O

My O
biggest O
point O
of O
praise O
is O
the O
lack O
of O

well O

the O
money O

This O
power O

does O
the O
job O
. O

It O
actually O
balances O
out O
nicely O
. O

So O
bought O
this O
IO O
Crest O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
; O
it O
arrived O
today O
. O

it O
does O
nt O
ballance O

I O
think O
that O
is O
reasonable O
considering O
the O
relatively O
high O
power O
needs O
of O
a O
larger O
, O
high O
- O
performance O
laptop O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
music O
reproduction O
is O
good O
, O
but O
the O
controls O
and O
underlying O
program O
are O
poor O
. O

While O
it O
's O
dirt O
cheap O
( O
trust O
me O

Love O
this O
in O
- O
house O
brand O
from O
Amazon O

Tried O
it O
the O

did O

do O

Per O
Incident O
" O
to O
talk O
to O
someone O
in O
customer O
support-- O
look O
here O
[ O
... O
] O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
original O
cord O
because O
my O
bunny O
chewed O
it O
... O

that O
severely O
when O
it O
just O
works O
so O
well O

Mine O
came O
on O
a O
nice O
plaid O
color O
looking O
fancier O
then O
a O
plain O
Jane O
case O
. O

This O
PC O
is O
a O
real O
bargain O
. O

BETTER O
AIR O
CIRCULATION O
ON O

The O
interface O
is O
intuitive O
and O
the O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
machine O
makes O
this O
easy O
. O

Plus O
, O
the O
zipper O
is O
good O
quality O
( O
not O
crazy O
, O
but O
good O
) O
, O
the O
the O
pull O
handle O
is O
surprisingly O
nice O
, O
and O
( O
lastly O
) O
the O
shipping O
it O
came O
in O
from O
Amazon O
was O
hassle O
free O
and O
not O
damaged O
or O
marked O
in O
any O
way O
. O

It O
has O
a O
very O
soft O
fur O
interior O
that O
will O
take O
care O
of O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
'm O
throwing O
at O
it O
, O
and O
still O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
need O
to O
have O
the O
memory O
upgraded O
, O
although O
I O
will O
probably O
still O
do O
that O
. O

TV O
is O
excellent O
. O

Granted O
, O
the O
backpack O
was O
n't O
made O
to O
carry O
all O
of O
your O
gear O
+ O
your O
laptop O
, O
so O
this O
was O
just O
me O
being O
hopeful O
. O

The O
internal O
configurability O
is O
top O
notch O
and O
the O
Velcro O
does O
stay O
in O
place O
remarkably O
well O
. O

The O
multi O
- O
touch O
trackpad O
is O
so O
easy O
and O
feature O

Removable O
power O
cord O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
other O
options O
. O

I O
replaced O
the O
monitor O
... O

I O
am O
glad O
that O
I O
moved O
up O
to O
this O
item O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
it O
for O
anything O
resource O
intensive O
, O
so O
the O
slow O
processor O
was O
n't O
an O
issue O
. O

It O
will O
not O
have O
enough O
space O
for O
a O
sweater O
or O
anything O
heavy O
like O
that O
unless O
you O
carry O
the O
comupter O
case O
by O
it O
self O
. O

If O
I O
do O
nt O
have O
to O
keep O
it O
in O
my O
backpack O

I O
can O
say O
that O
this O
product O
generally O
works O
properly O
, O
the O
ports O
has O
power O
over O
energy O
, O
and O
the O
installation O
is O
easy O
and O
practical O
, O
on O
Windows O
7 O
, O
and O
its O
work O
without O
installing O
with O
problems O
. O

Mine O
laptop O
has O
fallen O
many O
times O
but O
still O
work O
quite O
well O
apart O
from O
a O
particular O
annoying O
notice O
from O
most O
probably O
the O
cooling O
fan O
hitting O
something O
but O
still O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

I O
opted O
for O
this O
kit O
of O
16GBs O
for O
times O

It O
wo O
n't O
get O
on O

Even O
with O
all O
these O
things O
inside O
, O
its O
quite O
comfy O
, O
somewhat O
heavy O
( O
~&lt;15 O
lb O
. O
s O
) O
, O
and O
great O
to O
take O
along O
for O
road O
- O
trips O
. O

Many O
people O
on O
other O
reviews O
here O
experienced O
a O
little O
difficulty O
but O
not O
at O
the O
fault O
of O
this O
product O
. O

Typing O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
few O
sentences O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
adult O
hands O
and O
sites O
with O
more O
than O
text O
takes O
time O
-- O
as O
mentioned O
by O
the O
seller O
. O

Dead O
on O
arrival O

When O
you O
open O
the O

you O
'll O
be O
amazed O
at O
how O
unbelievably O
thin O
it O
is O

I O
have O
a O

I O
bought O
the O

from O
the O
apple O
store O
from O
a O
company O
called O
" O
incase O

and O
then O
I O
bought O
this O
product O
for O
the O
15 O
. O

One O
or O
the O
other O
will O
drop O
off O
. O

Windows O

takes O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
. O

I O
had O
to O
do O
some O
filing O
, O
but O
after O
my O
modification O
it O
worked O
just O
like O
the O
other O
one O
. O

The O
attached O
stylus O
works O
well O
, O
but O
may O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
. O

Coupled O
with O
a O
Verizon O
wireless O
card O
and O
service O
( O
costs O
extra O
) O
you O
can O
go O
anywhere O
and O
still O
be O
productive O
. O

Excellent O
product O
, O
Comfortable O
, O
spacious O
and O
resistant O
to O
any O
circumstance O
, O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
to O
say O
regarding O
this O
article O
. O

Since O
this O
is O
n't O
a O
fault O
of O
the O
case O
, O
it O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
my O
rating O
, O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
let O
other O
Yoga O
2 O
Pro O
owners O
know O
that O
this O
particular O
model O
wo O
n't O
fit O
. O

As O
for O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
USB O
fan O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
not O
silent O
, O
and O
it O
is O
noiser O
than O
my O
Dell O
laptop O
running O
on O
its O
own O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
cable O
after O
losing O
the O
stock O
cable O
that O
my O
ps4 O
arrives O
with O
. O

0the O
keyboard O
is O
BACKLIT O
but O
it O
is O
only O
white O
. O

but O
once O
you O
got O
it O
, O
it O
will O
be O
the O
best O
os O
you O
ever O
used O
. O

A O
Wacom O
pen O
is O
an O
artist O
's O
tool O
. O

I O
then O
called O
Sony O
who O
said O
they O
would O
make O
a O
case O
number O
and O
that O
a O
Sony O
repair O
agent O
would O
have O
to O
insert O
a O
USB O
correction O
device O
. O

I O
can O
attend O
a O
formal O
or O
informal O
meeting O
with O
it O
without O
being O
worried O
about O
its O
size O
. O

but O
I O
will O
update O
if O
it O
becomes O
a O
problem O
. O

Then O
I O
seen O
the O
Asus O
and O
did O
n't O
buy O
1 O
until O
there O
were O
alot O
of O
reviews O
on O
it O
. O

Smart O
move O
because O
my O
wireless O
performance O
is O
awesome O
everywhere O
in O
my O
home O
, O
including O
partially O
underground O
basement O
area O
. O

HP O
was O
able O
to O
make O
more O
ergonomical O
shape O
, O
but O
it O
's O
OK O
anyway O

That O
and O
knowing O
a O
few O
key O
shortcuts O
like O
Win+D O
for O
Desktop O
, O
Win+C O
for O
" O
Charms O
" O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
upgrade O
the O
drive O
within O
a O
month O
or O
two O
once O
I O
decide O
on O
the O
new O
Hitachi O
hard O
drive O
or O
the O
OCZ O
solid O
state O
drive O
. O

It O
works O
great O
and O
holds O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Overall O
there O
are O
n't O
many O
cons O
, O
but O
there O
are O
a O
few O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
sturdy O
case O
. O

Arrived O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half O
later O
( O
not O
bad O
, O
considering O
it O
came O
from O
some O
mystery O
industrial O
province O
in O
China O
) O
in O
a O
solid O
bubble O
wrap O
parcel O
. O

On O
the O
lighter O
side O
of O
the O
inexpensive O
laptop O
spectrum1366x768 O
screen O
resolution O
is O
standard O
. O

It O
's O
very O
nicely O
designed O
, O
looks O
great O
, O
is O
very O
portable O
, O
has O
a O
great O
display O
, O
a O
fine O
keyboard O
, O
very O
good O
performance O
, O
and O
some O
nice O
bits O
like O
a O
full O
size O
HDMI O
port O
. O

Plus O
it O
has O
2 O
USB O
charging O
ports O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
7 O
USB O
ports O
. O

Or O
it O
was O
at O
the O
time O
, O
anyway O
. O

While O
having O
the O
VGA O
cable O
connected O
directly O
into O
the O
DVR O
provides O
a O
live O
image O
of O
what O
the O
cameras O
are O
capturing O
. O

Outside O
pocket O
also O
has O
a O
mini O
pocket O
inside O
to O
hold O
a O
flash O
drive O
. O

Like O
keyboard O
noise O
... O
I O
personally O
do O
not O
think O
that O
there O
is O
an O
issue O
, O
while O
others O
have O
complained O
... O

I O
fit O
lots O
of O
stuff O
inside O
, O
like O
a O
portable O
mouse O
, O
USB O
drives O
, O
notes O
, O
etc O
. O

Worked O
great O
on O
both O
computers O
. O

I O
'm O
debating O
whether O
to O
RMA O
the O
unit O
. O

For O
example O
even O
after O
I O
close O
Media O
Center O
, O
it O
still O
has O
some O
background O
process O
running O
, O
which O
prevents O
me O
from O
unplugging O
my O
TV O
tuner O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
new O
system O
to O
rock O
the O
house O
, O
do O
n't O
get O
these O
. O

Makes O
me O
smile O

It O
's O
pretty O
to O
look O
at O
, O
seems O
incredibly O
well O
built O
, O
is O
lightweight O
and O
has O
a O
good O
battery O
. O

I O
carry O
my O
laptop O
in O
my O
Swiss O
Gear O
backpack O
, O
and O
I O
was O
just O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
scratches O
and O
give O
a O
little O
additional O
cushion O
while O
in O
transit O
. O

this O
card O
is O
installed O
in O
is O
brought O
up O
from O
standby O
mode O
the O
card O
stalls O
and O
reports O
a O
power O
surge O
error O
for O
all O
ports O
. O

I O
love O
this O
cooler O
fits O
my O
17 O
inch O

These O
shipped O
extremely O
fast O
. O

and O
it O
all O
comes O
together O
. O

It O
looks O
smart.- O
Battery O
time O

3 O
+ O
hours.- O
Has O
all O
the O
other O
essential O
ports O
such O
as O
Network O
, O
Firewire O
etc O
. O

The O
only O
other O
thing O
missing O
( O
for O
me O
) O
is O
a O
backlit O
keyboard O
; O
but O
I O
knew O
that O
before O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

I O
wish O
all O
computer O
purchases O
were O
this O
easy O
. O

It O
plugged O
into O
each O
of O
our O
laptops O
with O
absolutely O
no O
issue O
, O
no O
warning O
or O
alert O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
I O
have O
, O
which O
occurs O
once O
a O
week O
at O
least O
, O
is O
that O
the O
touch O
feature O
stops O
working O
. O

The O
material O
is O
a O
lot O
thinner O
and O
there O
are O
fewer O
pockets O
and O
devices O
, O
but O
in O
some O
ways O
I O
actually O
prefer O
this O
messenger O
bag O
design O
to O
our O
older O
top O
loader O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
be O
able O
to O
display O

on O
our O

from O
Netflix O

the O

have O
, O
the O
rest O
, O
plays O
games O
like O
a O

and O
everyday O
computing O
is O
great O
. O

You O
have O
to O
have O
your O
fingers O
really O
clear O
of O
the O
touchpad O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
do O

accidentally O

for O

When O
they O
gave O
out O
and O
I O
opened O
the O
UPS O
to O
replace O
them O
, O
I O
discovered O
they O
had O
swollen O
so O
much O
that O
they O
could O
not O
be O
removed O
except O
with O
a O
great O
deal O

Works O
as O
described O

only O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
it O
was O
the O
wire O
coming O
slightly O
loose O

This O

The O
problem O
is O
with O

This O
is O
the O
most O

Nice O

The O
asus O

offers O
no O
details O
... O

But O
there O
's O
a O
fix O
for O
that O
if O
it O
really O
bothers O
you O
. O

The O
cord O
that O
connects O
the O
outlet O
to O
the O
adapter O
was O
a O
little O
loose O
on O
the O
adapter O
end O
and O
after O
about O
a O
month O
it O
stopped O
connecting O
at O
all O
. O

I O
'm O
liking O
this O
keyboard O
so O
much O
that O
I O
anticipate O
using O
it O
a O
lot O
. O

So O
, O
if O
I O
could O
give O
less O
than O
one O
star O
I O
would O
, O
but O
that O
's O
the O
minimum O
. O

Drives O
just O
slide O
in O
. O

You O
remove O
two O
screws O
and O
slide O
out O
the O
end O
of O
the O
case O
that O
the O
cable O
plugs O
into O
, O
slip O
that O
end O
onto O
your O
hard O
drive O
, O
then O
slide O
the O
whole O
thing O
back O
together O
and O
put O
back O
the O
two O
screws O
. O

I O
previously O
used O
, O
this O
case O
is O
heavier O
, O
thicker O
and O
harder O
to O
open O
/ O
close O
. O

I O
have O
a O
moderate O
to O
high O
level O
of O
I. O
T. O
Background O
, O
and O
know O
that O
sometimes O
configuring O
wireless O
devices O
can O
be O
a O
challenge O
. O

I O
took O
this O
and O
a O
6 O
plug O
surge O
protector O
on O
my O
trip O
to O
the O
Philippines O
. O

Plasmas O
also O
tend O
to O
eat O
a O
little O
more O
energy O
than O
LCDs O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
does O
not O
recognize O
my O
devices O
. O

During O
my O
search O
I O
came O
across O
the O
Belkin O
outlet O
and O
for O
the O
price O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
500 O
used O
records O
. O

But O
just O
let O
me O
install O
the O
thing O
as O
a O
client O
device O

That O
seemed O
to O
take O
a O
while O
, O
but O
with O
automatic O
updates O
enabled O
, O
it O
's O
a O
one O
- O
time O
event O
. O

I O
'm O
probably O
leaving O
the O
house O
for O
semi O
- O
extended O
period O
of O
time O
such O
as O
4 O
or O
5 O
hours O
or O
a O
few O
days O
or O
even O
vacation O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
had O
an O
Acer O
laptop O
he O
was O
giving O
to O
a O
friend O
of O
her O
's O
. O

It O
fit O
very O
well O
. O

When O
the O
Actiontec O
receiver O
displayed O
its O
" O
Ready O
to O
Connect O
" O
message O
on O
the O
screen O
, O
I O
followed O
the O
instructions O
to O
start O
the O
Intel O
WiDi O
program O
on O
my O
PC O
. O

Not O
having O
to O
pay O
for O
added O
security O
software O
( O
still O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
one O
subscription O
as O
we O
still O
have O
an O
HP O
desktop O
- O
not O
for O
long O
though O
because O
I O
am O
looking O
at O
the O
iMac O
) O
. O

I O
could O
fit O
all O
my O
misc O
work O
stuff O
including O
the O
power O
adapter O
and O
the O
mouse O
. O

Has O
fold O
out O
stands O
that O
prevent O
overheating O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
that O
is O
true O
for O
all O
of O
these O
, O
or O
if O
I O
just O
got O
lucky O
. O

Used O
these O
to O
upgrade O
my O
2011 O
27 O
" O
iMac O
to O
32 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
since O
I O
use O
virtual O
machines O
quite O
a O
bit O
and O
also O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
conversion O

When O
I O
switch O
from O
my O
desktop O
to O
this O
Zenbook O
, O
I O
barely O
notice O
a O
difference O
. O

Ill O
update O
if O
it O
gives O
me O
any O
probs O
in O
the O
future O

The O
construction O
of O
the O
unit O
is O
pleasantly O
rugged O
for O
the O
low O
price O
. O

He O
only O
listens O
to O
music O
and O
hates O
the O
sound O
. O

There O
is O
also O
no O
Wifi O
on O
/ O
off O
button O
. O

Just O
wanted O
a O
slip O
case O
to O
put O
the O
laptop O
in O
so O
my O
cats O
will O
not O
bother O
it O
. O

so O
I O
called O
Onkyo O
since O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
handshake O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
D O
- O
Link O
's O
website O
( O
or O
customer O
service O
, O
while O
we O
're O
on O
the O
subject O
) O
, O
so O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
taken O
aback O
that O
Microsoft O
was O
ahead O
of O
D O
- O
Link O
's O
site O
. O

This O
is O
my O
wife O
's O
machine O
and O
to O
make O
the O
machine O
immediately O
useful O
for O
her O
I O
installed O
Classic O
Shell O
to O
give O
the O
Windows O
8 O

This O
still O
did O
n't O
resolve O
the O
disconnecting O
issue O
. O

Before O
buying O
it O
, O
be O
aware O
that O
Wacom O
, O
the O
largest O
producer O
of O
such O
things O
, O
offers O
many O
different O
products O
and O
variants O
at O
many O
price O
points O
. O

Finally O
, O
while O
it O
worked O
with O
my O
Toshiba O
laptop O
, O
I O
just O
got O
a O
new O
Dell O
14 O
" O
laptop O
( O
in O
November O
2009 O
) O
, O
and O
NONE O
OF O
THE O
TIPS O
FIT O
! O

85 O
Watt O
AC O
/ O
DC O
Power O
Adapter O
with O
Dual O
Charging O
Device O
said O
it O
only O
weighed O
8 O
oz O
. O

The O
Lowepro O
250 O
AW O
series O
of O
camera O
bags O
have O
been O
around O
more O
several O
years O
and O
I O
mistakenly O
thought O
that O
the O
more O
recent O
Case O
Logic O
bag O
would O
be O
more O
updated O
and O
superior O
since O
it O
was O
priced O
much O
higher O
too O
- O
WRONG O
! O

If O
the O
unit O
is O
charging O
. O

I O
inserted O
the O
supplied O
CD O
to O
install O
the O
driver O
, O
and O
initially O
it O
had O
difficulty O
Discovering O
that O
the O
adapter O
was O
plugged O
in O
, O
but O
subsequent O
trials O
, O
it O
found O
the O
adapter O
but O
was O
stuck O
at O
the O
next O
step O
. O

That O
's O
all O
well O
and O
good O

It O
also O
makes O
it O
awkward O
to O
set O
the O
backpack O
down O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
Belkin O
product O
. O

The O
picture O
with O
the O
keyboard O
folded O
does O
n't O
show O
that O
all O
the O
keyboard O
's O
letters O
are O
not O
a O
uniform O
size O
. O

a O
little O
bulky O
, O
but O
it O
was O
workable O
in O
most O
situations O
and O
stayed O
put O
on O
the O
phone O
while O
in O
a O
pocket O
or O
cup O
holder O
in O
the O
car O
. O

( O
I O
called O
HP O
and O
they O
will O
sell O
only O
with O
Win8 O
) O
. O

I O
have O
saved O
myself O
so O
frustration O
. O

I O
go O
and O
not O
break O
my O
back.(While O

The O
product O
may O
look O
dorky O
( O
21st O
century O
rabbit O
ears O
, O
I O
guess O
) O
but O
it O
delivers O
reliability O
and O
speed O
at O
distance O
-- O
exactly O
what O
you O
want O
out O
of O
a O
USB O
adapter O
. O

I O
had O
used O
a O
neoprene O
sleeve O
on O
my O
old O
laptop O
which O
at O
times O
was O
not O
the O
most O
convenient O
in O
class O
. O

The O
photo O
section O
is O
again O
well O
padded O
and O
a O
little O
changable O
to O
accomodate O
your O
various O
needs O
. O

, O
I O
COULD O
HAVE O
BOUGHT O
A O
NEW O
LAPTOP O
, O
NO O
JOKE O
. O

if O
you O
encode O
to O
MPEG O
, O
you O
can O
then O
use O
any O
computer O
to O
edit O
and O
have O
great O
results O
. O

The O
TV O
was O
preassembled O
with O
the O
pedestal O
and O
was O
set O
on O
our O
built O
in O
entertainment O
center O
. O

All O
I O
needed O
to O
do O
was O
clean O
the O
back O
of O
my O
phone O
and O
moisten O
the O
suction O
cups O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
keyboard O
looking O
at O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
were O
saying O
it O
works O
with O
Android O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another O

It O
would O
have O
decent O

very O
little O
in O

. O

I O
had O
done O
my O
homework O
reading O
reviews O
about O
the O
best O
netbook O
, O
and O
Asus O
was O
always O
up O
on O

However O
, O
I O
have O
a O
Pikachu O

under O
the O
Apple O

Perfect O
fit O
for O
my O

. O

I O
've O
just O
received O
the O
device O
and O
am O
in O
the O
initial O
stages O
of O
use O
, O
and O
all O
is O
well O
. O

It O
's O
good O
for O
connecting O
a O

or O
desktop O
computer O
to O
a O
10/100Mbps O
network O
, O
and O
works O
with O
Windows O

or O
a O
Mac O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
ultrabook O
that O
mostly O
meets O
all O
of O
my O
expectations O
. O

I O
got O
these O
primarily O
for O
gaming O
and O
sometimes O
a O
little O
music O
. O

A O
few O
pople O
said O
that O
the O
screen O

is O
a O
little O
small O
and O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
cover O
the O
entire O

the O

According O
to O
support O
for O
both O
Toshiba O
, O
and O
DisplayLink O
( O
they O
provide O
the O
software O
for O
the O
video O
drivers O
) O
, O
this O
was O
a O
design O
choice O
of O
Toshiba O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
picture O
uploading O
to O
facebook O
, O
editing O
, O
and O
watermarking O
my O
photos O
. O

and O
all O
I O
like O
its O
design O
and O
price O

It O
was O
$ O
40 O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
cost O
. O

There O
is O
no O
notification O
light O
on O
the O
camera O
which O
would O
tell O
you O
if O
camera O
is O
on O
or O
off O
. O

We O
cancelled O
our O
cable O
and O
now O
watch O
primarily O
through O
Roku O
or O
the O
Wii O
, O
but O
since O
Hulu O
Plus O
is O
really O
limited O
, O
many O
of O
our O
favorite O
programs O
are O
online O
- O
only O
. O

I O
've O
owned O
5 O
different O
MP3 O
video O
players O
over O
the O
years O
. O

For O
up O
to O
now O
and O
for O
so O
long O
Apple O
held O
the O
best O
WQHD O
, O
or O
WQXGA O
, O
monitor O
for O
users O
that O
needed O
more O
than O
1080p O
HD O
resolutions O
. O

Have O
a O
PC O
at O
work O
, O
figured O
I O
'd O
just O
do O
the O
same O
at O
home O
. O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
an O
adapter O
that O
shows O
to O
be O
charging O
unless O
it O
is O
an O
actual O
nook O
charger O
. O

You O
're O
going O
along O
and O
trying O
to O
backspace O

I O
ordered O
this O
and O
had O
it O
rush O
shipped O
because O
various O
, O
important O
items O
were O
on O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

Its O
good O
for O
its O
price O

I O
purchased O
the O
blue O
one O
and O
loved O
the O
way O
it O
was O
made O
. O

As O
one O
can O
see O
the O
Pros O
are O
greater O
than O
the O
Cons O
.. O
after O
2 O
years O
my O
daughter O
is O
still O
pleased O
with O
this O
lap O
top O
. O

The O
fit O
was O
tight O
and O
secure O
, O
but O
because O
of O
other O
terrible O
reviews O
I O
took O
extra O
care O
not O
to O
allow O
too O
much O
stress O
or O
twist O
to O
occure O
around O
the O
connection O
. O

--------------This O
is O
my O
last O
update O
. O

the O
hinges O
which O
hold O
all O
four O
corners O
was O
just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

Both O
My O
Asus O
's O
cost O
a O
max O
of O
$ O
1 O
, O
200 O
but O
after O
upgrading O
the O
ram O
and O
adding O
a O
second O
hard O
drive O
as O
will O
as O
upgrading O
the O
wifi O
+ O
any O
labor O
expenses O
they O
each O
cost O
as O
much O
as O
this O
Samsung O
. O

2 O
Alkaline O
AAA O
cells O
included O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
! O

Remember O
, O
actual O
battey O
life O
is O
sujective O
, O
that O
is O
why O
I O
'm O
not O
complaining O
about O
this O
one O
. O

So O
far O
the O
LCD O
is O
working O
great O
and O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

I O
travel O
a O
lot O
to O
see O
family O

Of O
course O
that O
means O
it O
would O
be O
larger O
. O

Please O
Asus O
contact O
me O

They O
started O
to O
break O
apart O
at O
the O
small O
connections O
protecting O
the O
vents O
. O

Very O
well O
made O
, O
very O
well O
thought O
out O
, O
and O
absolutely O
zero O
space O
is O
wasted O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
10 O

1 O

Works O
great O
with O
new O
iPad O

The O
screen O
is O
larger O
than O
I O
had O
expected O
. O

I O
have O
quite O
good O
hearing O

your O

It O
also O

the O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
felt O
the O
need O
to O
write O
a O
review O
. O

Though O
I O
was O
aware O
there O
are O
not O
enough O
s O
/ O
w O
available O
for O
Mac O
( O
as O
compared O

, O
did O
nt O
know O
I O
have O
to O
shell O
out O
for O
each O
small O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
do O
. O

Pros O
: O
I O
did O
appreciate O
the O
compartments O
and O
organization O
, O
particularly O
on O
the O
back O
panel O
- O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
rolling O
bag O
that O
I O
have O
used O
from O
an O
organization O
standpoint O
. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
good O
cover O
for O
the O
money O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
Dell O
battery O
has O
extremely O
poor O
reviews O
on O
their O
website O
, O
and O
I O
have O
not O
found O
a O
compatible O
battery O
, O
so O
I O
am O
without O
, O
even O
though O
I O
need O
one O
. O

Extremely O
thin O
but O
very O
sturdy O
feeling O
. O

I O
fully O
expect O
it O
to O
last O
me O
years O
and O
should O
stand O
up O
to O
the O
abuses O
of O
airline O
travel O
very O
well O
. O

It O
would O
make O
a O
great O
computer O
for O
a O
teen O
! O

It O
is O
now O
January O
2012 O
and O
up O
till O
now O
the O
battery O
life O
seemed O
to O
be O
predictably O
losing O
its O
capacity O
at O
a O
steady O
rate O
of O
degeneration O
till O
last O
week O
when O
it O
went O
from O
being O
able O
to O
power O
my O
laptop O
for O
at O
least O
20 O
minutes O
to O
where O
it O
now O
will O
only O
give O
me O
enough O
juice O
for O
2 O
minutes O
. O

Cheap O
but O
slow O
, O
a O
deal O
breaker O
! O

The O
OS O
is O
remarkably O
stable O
. O

After O
buying O
this O
one O
, O
I O
came O
across O
a O
similar O
battery O
that O
was O
7200 O
mAh O
. O

Targus O
cheaping O
out O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
headphone O
jack O
really O
makes O
that O
feature O
useless O
for O
iphone O
users O
who O
would O
be O
better O
off O
with O
the O
standard O
headphone O
cord O
pass O
thru O
slot O
most O
other O
backpacks O
have O
. O

desktop O
tripod O
with O
it O
, O
that O
way O
I O
can O
position O
the O
webcam O
exactly O
where O
I O
want O
. O

Now O
my O
skin O
will O
not O
crawl O
so O
bad O
when O
people O
come O
over O
to O
point O
at O
my O
screen O
and O
touch O
it O
, O
I O
hate O
people O
touching O
my O
screen O
. O

And O
try O
out O
some O
extensions O
and O
apps O
. O

Though O
I O
've O
yet O
flown O
with O
the O
case O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
the O
middle O
zipper O
for O
laying O
the O
case O
flat O
on O
the O
security O
checkpoint O
conveyor O
should O
be O
a O
time O
saver O
. O

The O
keys O
work O
fine O
but O
feel O
cheap O
, O
flimsy O
, O
and O
loose O
. O

if O
it O
ever O
fails O
( O
granted O
I O
think O
it O
has O
a O
lifetime O
warranty).My O

It O
cleans O
the O
screen O
very O
well O
, O
just O
like O
a O
high O
quality O
microfiber O
polish O
cloth O
that O
you O
might O
use O
for O
your O
eyeglasses O
. O

While O
the O
speaker O
is O
loud O
, O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
n't O
as O
incredible O
. O

Maybe O
can O
get O
an O
old O
laptop O
working O
that O
had O
5 O
or O
6 O
different O
batteries O
listed O
. O

Blue O
Netbook O

Hour O

. O

Use O
the O
drivers O
only O
. O

and O
I O
use O
them O
at O
work O
to O
play O
music O
. O

I O
spent O
some O
time O
Googling O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
offered O
solutions O
seemed O
to O
work O
. O

The O
initial O
use O
of O
putting O
it O
on O
the O
screen O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
nerve O
wracking O
. O

One O
claims O
its O
best O
to O
get O
the O
Vista O
driver O
from O
the O
Realtek O
site O
. O

Very O
good O
work O
well O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
do O
not O
have O
much O
bass O

Unless O
, O
of O
course O
, O
you O
enjoy O
products O
that O
are O
poorly O
designed O
and O
intrusive O
to O
boot O
. O

I O
sort O
of O
like O
the O
faint O
rubbery O
smell O
, O
which O
reminds O
me O
of O
visits O
to O
a O
tire O
store O
. O

The O
laptop O
itself O
measures O
18&#34 O
; O
wide O
by O
13&#34 O
; O
inches O
deep O
so O
the O
keyboard O
is O
full O
sized O
. O

It O
's O
inexpensive O
and O
very O
convenient O
. O

I O
am O
even O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
shipping O
. O

But O
the O
HP O
ones O
are O
very O
expensive O
, O
and O
if O
we O
're O
being O
honest O
this O
model O
laptop O
is O
very O
old O
now O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
front O
pocket O
with O
a O
nice O
organizer O
section O
that O
can O
hold O
pens O
, O
business O
cards O
, O
USB O
sticks O
, O
etc O
( O
again O
, O
right O
in O
front O
so O
easily O
accessible O
) O
. O

This O
usually O
helps O
, O
as O
does O
limiting O
the O
number O
of O
programs O
I O
'm O
running O
. O

Do O
n't O
know O
why O
but O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
to O
get O
this O
set O
up O
. O

So O
I O
think O
this O
is O
what O
killed O
the O
graphics O
processor O
in O
this O
case O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
definitely O
has O
the O
better O
display O
all O
around O
. O

I O
now O
use O
my O
laptop O
in O
the O
following O
manner O
: O
first O
, O
I O
plug O
the O
RCA O
receiving O
unit O
into O
the O
wall O
outlet O
nearest O
where O
I O
want O
to O
sit O
; O
then O
I O
turn O
on O
the O
printer O
; O
and O
finally O
, O
I O
extend O
the O
little O
blue O
tooth O
- O
shaped O
antenna O
( O
how O
cute O
! O
) O

I O
also O
really O
like O
the O
bright O
orange O
inside O

I O
travel O
with O
it O
a O
lot O

Aside O
from O
this O
problem O
the O
case O
looks O
good O
. O

All O
of O
my O
home O
- O
built O
and O
work O
- O
built O
towers O
sport O
ASUS O
motherboards O
. O

If O
you O
live O
in O
an O
any O
major O
city O
, O
this O
thing O
will O
work O
great O
for O
you O
. O

I O
have O
gone O
from O
2 O
hours O
of O
battery O
time O
to O
3 O
+ O
hours O
, O
and O
my O
laptop O
still O
fits O
in O
my O
bag O
. O

Still O
disappointed O
though O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
my O
22 O
" O
monitor O
resolution O
higher O
than O
1024 O
x O
769 O
when O
I O
attach O
it O
to O
the O
laptop O
's O
VGA O
port O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
product O
would O
be O
bigger O
and O
better O
made O
. O

There O
is O
not O
much O
to O
say O
about O
a O
computer O
charger O
except O
that O
it O
does O
its O
job O
in O
charging O
my O
computer O
at O
the O
right O
speed O
. O

I O
was O
in O
desperate O
need O
of O
a O
new O
travel O
bag O
. O

I O
have O
taken O
it O
on O
numerous O
business O
trips O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
long O
vacations O
. O

I O
almost O
removed O
a O
star O
for O
this O
, O
but O
decided O
that O
perhaps O
the O
target O
market O
is O
the O
folks O
who O
have O
~200 O
GB O
300Gb O
disk O
drives O
now O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
stereo O
separation O
, O
the O
audio O
playback O
does O
n't O
really O
come O
across O
as O
significantly O
high O
- O
grade O
. O

This O
helps O
to O
offset O
the O
non O
retina O
display O
. O

Then O
it O
started O
having O
connection O
issues O
with O
my O
mac O
( O
the O
same O
mac O
I O
had O
used O
the O
year O
it O
worked O
fine O
) O
. O

We O
will O
see O
how O
long O
this O
one O
lasts O
! O

but O
, O
this O
battery O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
is O
working O
very O
well O
giving O
me O
over O
4 O
hours O
of O
life O
. O

I O
expected O
to O
have O
to O
relearn O
everything O
all O
over O
again O
. O

The O
zippers O
are O
smooth O
, O
and O
the O
nylon O
construction O
is O
sturdy O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
little O
speaker O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
very O
cheap O
price O
. O

The O
extra O
buttons O
make O
it O
extremely O
easy O
to O
navigate O
pages O
on O
the O
web O
. O

There O
is O
a O
USB O
cord O
that O
once O
connected O
to O
your O
laptop O
, O
turns O
on O
the O
fan O
which O
keeps O
cool O
air O
circulating O
underneath O
. O

The O
fan O
when O
running O
is O
fairly O
quiet O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
the O
adapter O
for O
2 O
days O
and O
find O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
making O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
cell O
phone O
and O
downloading O
pictures O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
pretty O
slow O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
timed O
it O
yet O
, O
but O
the O
battery O
life O
of O
my O
laptop O
is O
easily O
10x O
more O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be O
. O

It O
worked O
flawlessly O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
( O
like O
the O
last O
one O
) O
and O
now O
it O
's O
not O
dropping O
wireless O
connections O
but O
seems O
to O
just O
stop O
working O
. O

" O
HP O
Pavillion O
no O
problem O

adapter O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
pay O
the O
additional O
cost O
and O
order O
the O
more O
expensive O
PowerFast O
adapter O
for O
my O
wife O
realizing O
that O
I O
should O
have O
done O
that O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

DVD O
/ O
CD O
SuperDrive O
really O
had O
all O
I O
needed O
. O

The O
price O
was O
good O
. O

but O
it O
kept O
coming O
up O
as O
a O
video O
card O
I O
was O
just O
- O
about O
to O
return O
it O

There O
seem O
to O
be O
several O
better O
ones O
available O
, O
that O
are O
not O
only O
more O
comfortable O
and O
slimmer O
, O
but O
also O
less O
expensive O
. O

The O
bag O
looked O
bulky O
and O
felt O
too O
big O
for O
comfort O
. O

Fits O
my O
ultrabook O
. O

Because O
this O
HDTV O
does O
so O
much O
, O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
information O
to O
process O
and O
the O
manual O
is O
a O
bit O
difficult O
to O
read O
. O

I O
also O
still O
have O
the O
cap O
attached O
to O
it O
which O
is O
suprising O
. O

720p O
on O
16:9 O
gobbles O
5 O
pixels O
per O
side O
, O
so O
720p O
justscan O
for O
DVD O
here O
. O

They O
're O
great O
for O
plugging O
into O
a O
laptop O
or O
iPod O
to O
share O
music O
or O
for O
watching O
movies O
. O

It O
is O
short O
, O
but O
it O
is O
great O
for O
laptop O
user O
who O
does O
not O
what O
to O
carry O
around O
extra O
cables O
. O

The O
form O
is O
nice O
, O
and O
it O
balances O
well O
on O
my O
lap O
. O

i O
figured O
for O
my O
first O
mac O
this O
would O
be O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

The O
volume O
control O
on O
the O
media O
player O
you O
are O
using O
will O
also O
work O
. O

The O
same O
excellent O
build O
quality O
is O
also O
in O
this O
HDMI O
- O
to O
- O
DVI O
- O
D O
- O
dual O
- O
link O
cable O
. O

The O
only O
improvement O
it O
could O
have O
had O
is O
an O
off O
/ O
on O
switch O
so O
that O
it O
would O
n't O
need O
unplugged O
from O
the O
USB O
when O
not O
needed O

I O
did O
not O
have O
the O
same O
issues O
that O
other O
users O
were O
reporting O
about O
multiple O
drivers/ O
software O
on O
the O
disk O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

I O
use O
mine O
to O
hold O
my O
camera O
, O
camcorder O
, O
various O
battery O
packs O
, O
chargers O
, O
USB O
mouse O
, O
laptop O
accessories O
, O
and O
( O
yes O
) O
even O
my O
laptop O
on O
some O
occasions O
. O

The O

on O
the O

actually O
says O

I O
took O
one O
out O
and O
placed O
it O
back O
in O
to O
lack O
my O
flash O
in O
the O
bag O
as O
well O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
surprising O
good O
and O
it O
is O
used O
to O
play O
music O
from O
an O
SD O
card O
all O
night O
long O
at O
a O
low O

level O
. O

I O
can O
see O

for O

use O
. O

Here O
is O
my O
short O
review O
. O

It O
's O
compact O
and O
loud O
enough O
to O
fill O
a O
single O
room O
. O

Two O
of O
them O
worked O
fine O
, O
but O
the O
third O
one O
developed O
an O
intermittent O
connection O
after O
a O
few O
days O
. O

I O
originally O
had O
the O

and O
this O
was O
given O
to O
me O
as O
a O
replacement O
because O
I O
sent O
in O
the O
original O
and O
all O
replacements O
of O
the O
UX302LA O
and O
UX302LG O
were O
out O
of O
stock O

I O
got O
to O
try O
out O
the O
Acer O
Aspire O
One O
at O
a O
local O
Best O
Buy O
, O
and O
felt O
that O
the O
keyboard O
size O
was O
just O
right O
. O

Triple O
duty O
for O
two O
different O
devices O
. O

I O
have O
experienced O
no O
issues O
with O
this O
or O
any O
other O
Corsair O
power O
supply O
I O
have O
purchased O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Blu O
ray O
blew O
my O
mind O
. O

I O
purchased O
these O
cloths O
based O
on O
their O
Amazon O
rating O
and O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
I O
did O
! O

But O
it O
also O
wo O
n't O
go O
away O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
I O
try O
! O

This O
will O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
those O
situations O
where O
audio O
coming O
over O
hdmi O
ca O
n't O
be O
increased O
and O
the O
receiving O
TV O
or O
projector O
's O
analog O
output O
is O
too O
weak O
to O
drive O
headphones O
or O
powered O
speakers O
optimally O
. O

Not O
a O
huge O
deal O
, O
but O
worth O
noting O
. O

The O
Logitech O
Z O
Cinema O
speakers O
I O
normally O
use O
have O
much O
better O
mid O
- O
range O
and O
bass O

And O
it O
works O
as O
expected O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
at O
an O
even O
better O
price O
, O
with O
a O
few O
things O
slightly O
holding O
it O
back O
. O

It O
sounds O
great O
, O
as O
good O
as O
much O
more O
expensive O
speakers O
I O
have O
sampled O
. O

The O
pocket O
on O
the O
front O
is O
perfect O
fit O
for O
the O
external O
DVD O
drive O
. O

they O
seem O
to O
be O
functionally O
nearly O
the O
same O
, O
come O
complete O
with O
hard O
drive O
, O
but O
without O
the O
eSATA O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
are O
using O
a O
full O
- O
body O
protective O
case O
on O
your O
iPhone O
/ O
iPod O
, O
it O
may O
not O
fit O
into O
the O
dock O
with O
the O
support O
adapter O
in O
place O
, O
since O
the O
fixed O
30-pin O
connector O
may O
not O
plug O
all O
the O
way O
into O
your O
device O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
chromebook O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O

Dell O
wants O
$ O
99 O
. O

The O
two O
fans O
come O
attached O
to O
the O
pad O
, O
but O
you O
can O
move O
them O
easily O
to O
any O
location O
of O
the O
pad O
you O
want O
( O
with O
just O
the O
push O
of O
a O
button O
that O
's O
on O
the O
fan O
) O
, O
but O
like O
I O
said O
, O
they O
're O
really O
not O
necessary O
because O
of O
how O
this O
meshpad O
was O
designed O
. O

So O
far O
no O
problems O
except O
some O
android O
apps O
do O
n't O
install O
right O
or O
do O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
. O

The O
Wenger O
model O
is O
probably O
the O
best O

I O
found O
this O
one O
which O
was O
cheap O
, O
and O
Prime O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
. O

Perhaps O
, O
because O
I O
wanted O
things O
small O
and O
less O
messy O
. O

it O
was O
the O
only O
one O
that O
I O
could O
find O
the O
would O
hold O
a O
17 O
in O
laptop O
, O
the O
bag O
is O
material O
so O
that O
s O
a O
bummer O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
a O
better O
bag O
like O
leather O

Item O
did O
not O
work O
at O
all O
, O
was O
cheep O
, O
but O
useless O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
contact O
them O
about O
refund O
or O
exchange O
. O

It O
was O
very O
irritating O
for O
my O
large O
man O
hands O
but O
my O
daughter O
loves O
it O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
okay O

The O
pad O
itself O
is O
okay O
. O

The O
other O
one O
was O
30 O
minutes O
. O

I O
installed O
a O
SSD O
also O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

While O
the O
Everki O
's O
exterior O
dimensions O
are O
bigger O
, O
that O
's O
deceiving O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
very O
strong O
, O
and O
I O
tested O
it O
to O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
at O
least O
15 O
pounds O

5 O
" O
$ O
1000 O
+ O
ultraportables O
and O
not O
to O
full O
laptops O
. O

the O
Anker O
Golden O
AC O
Adapter O

It O
easily O
held O
the O
charge O
to O
play O
a O
two O
hour O
movie O
. O

I O
love O
its O
weight O
, O
super O
fast O
boot O
time O
and O
overall O
performance O
. O

I&#8217;m O
getting O
another O
. O

Rom O
drive O
I O
can O
play O
my O
CD O
now O

Other O
than O
that O
this O
product O
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
an O
older O
laptop O
that O
was O
dragging O
my O
gigabit O
network O
down O
to O
100meg O
throughput O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
on O
Windows O
and O
do O
n't O
mind O
spending O
the O
extra O
bucks O
, O
go O
for O
it O
. O

the O
price O
and O
quick O
delivery O
are O
great O
. O

I O
suspect O
the O
hardware O
was O
originally O
designed O
with O
Windows O
7 O
in O
mind O
, O
and O
Windows O
8 O
( O
which O
I O
like O
) O
has O
been O
grafted O
onto O
a O
unit O
for O
which O
that O
may O
not O
have O
been O
an O
optimal O
decision O
. O

I O
expect O
they O
will O
soon O
discontinue O
this O
model O
so O
get O
it O
while O
you O
can O
. O

I O
purchased O
two O
of O
these O
. O

This O
is O
WAY O
better O
than O
the O
original O
battery O
( O
42T4511/92P1132 O
) O
that O
would O
only O
last O
2 O
hours O
max O
. O

I O
am O
an O
avid O
iPad O
user O
and O
boy O
, O
does O
my O
screen O
get O
gross O
and O
fingerprinty O
. O

The O
cables O
are O
great O
! O

Chromcast O
is O
limited O
to O
those O
apps O
though O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
use O
other O
apps O
, O
or O
mirroring O
you O
are O
out O
of O
luck O
right O
now O
. O

I O
put O
this O
Macbook O
inside O
my O
Brenthaven O
case O
( O
great O
case O
by O
the O
way O
) O
and O
the O
old O
Macbook O
took O
up O
a O
big O
space O
of O
compartment O
but O
now O
because O
I O
have O
a O
thinner O
one O
its O
much O
roomier O
inside O
there O
now O

So O
, O
that O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
tried O
to O
play O
using O
this O
dock O
, O
the O
game O
launched O
OK O
, O
and O
I O
played O
just O
fine O
for O
a O
little O
while O
. O

I O
'll O
probably O
just O
leave O
it O
on O
my O
PC O
but O
it O
would O
be O
really O
easy O
to O
move O
it O
over O
to O
my O
laptop O
if O
I O
get O
the O
urge O
. O

I O
was O
unable O
to O
pair O
it O
with O
my O
HTC O
Rezound O
. O

Without O
this O
, O
it O
would O
be O
time O
consuming O
to O
mount O
& O
unmount O
the O
camera O
on O
top O
of O
the O
pre O
- O
amp O
each O
time O
. O

Design O
touches O
like O
the O
rubber O
, O
non O
- O
skid O
feet O
and O
ventilation O
, O
add O
to O
the O
appeal O
of O
the O
case O
. O

Works O
well O
. O

They O
did O
not O
write O
to O
the O
card O
, O
for O
some O
reason O
. O

: O
I O
paid O
around O
$ O
2000 O
for O
this O
excellent O
home O
theatre O
PC O
that O
does O
eveything O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
watching O
streaming O
media O
online O
, O
using O
Office O
applications O
like O
spreadsheets O
or O
presentations O
, O
or O
surfing O
the O
web O
. O

At O
first O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
to O
convert O
from O
my O
laptop O
's O
VGA O
to O
my O

you O
go O
back O
to O
your O
hotel O
, O
your O
friend O
's O
house O
, O
or O
wherever O
you O
're O

you O
can O

out O
of O
your O
other O
bag O
( O
the O
one O
you O
used O
for O
clothing O

. O
) O
. O

And O
the O
shoulder O

will O
be O
a O
deal O
breaker O
for O
some O
. O

This O
one O
works O
fine O
. O

The O
other O
extra O
pocket O
has O
a O
great O
design O
with O
extra O
pockets O
and O
spaces O
inside O
of O
it O
, O
great O
to O
put O
pens O
, O
small O
notes O
and O
also O
the O
charges O
or O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
. O

The O
wireless O
is O
great O

I O
have O
had O
all O
of O
the O
plugs O
filled O
at O
once O
, O
with O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

I O
made O
the O
necessary O
changes O
to O
stop O

no O
success O

We O
have O
two O
2nd O
gen O
iPod O
Touch O
units O
at O
our O
home O
and O
this O
is O
the O
third O
case O
purchased O
. O

As O
you O
turn O
it O
up O
it O
becomes O
distorted O
and O
crackly O
. O

Just O
slide O
the O
cover O
and O
push O
up O
to O
open O
the O
enclosure O
. O

I O
also O
would O
have O
liked O
the O
option O
for O
the O
larger O
1tb/32 O
gb O
hybrid O
drive O
. O

The O
device O
has O
a O
good O
fit O
just O
like O
the O
original O
power O
adapter O
connector O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
think O
you O
would O
regret O
purchasing O
this O
. O

Surprised O
there O
's O
not O
more O
good O
reviews O
on O
this O
really O
... O

Transcend O
cards O
in O
my O
cameras O
and O
MP3 O
players O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
. O

The O
webcam O
is O
simple O
to O
use O
but O
the O
LED O
's O
are O
quite O
powerful O
and O
can O
provide O
sufficient O
lighting O
in O
dark O
to O
make O
the O
subject O
visible O
. O

I O
find O
this O
useless O
as O
it O
is O
most O
common O
if O
you O
are O
giving O
a O
presentation O

First O
bootup O
out O
of O
the O
box O
working O
fine O
. O

On O
several O
laptops O
it O
did O
n't O
make O
a O
significant O
difference O
. O

So O
when O
I O
watch O
" O
TV O
" O
( O
I O
have O
satellite O
service O
) O
, O
I O
set O
it O
to O
" O
off O

no O

responded O
to O
my O
email O
3 O
days O
ago O
, O
and O
I O
just O
sent O
your O
product O
back O
. O

Some O
brief O
impressions O
with O
more O
to O
follow O
: O
Pros:-well O
built O
, O
quiet O
and O
low O
power O
consumption O
. O

Not O
my O
liking.)- O
Hidden O
stereo O
speakers O

a O
tinny O
sound O
with O
no O
perceivable O
stereo O
separation- O

I O
really O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
one O
argument O
against O
not O
owning O
these O
. O

MSI O
has O
not O
very O
good O
support O
( O
or O
should O
I O
say O
non O
- O
existant O
) O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
time O
trying O
to O
install O
the O
drivers O
properly O
if O
you O
ever O
need O
to O
. O

Frankly O
, O
these O
could O
be O
the O
same O
ones O
that O
other O
well O
- O
known O
brands O
use O
without O
the O
badge O
. O

Pretty O
poor O
. O

Black O
Friday O
sale O
, O
so O
after O
rebates O
( O
which O
I O
hope O
comes O
through O
) O
it O
will O
be O
$ O
34 O
. O

this O
charger O
was O
a O
great O
replacment O
it O
fit O
good O
and O
it O
works O
great O
to O
was O
a O
great O
buy O
my O
client O
was O
happy O

The O
included O
stylus O
stays O
secure O
in O
the O
side O
ribbon O
. O

Coupled O
with O
the O
rotatable O
connector O
feature O
, O
connection O
in O
any O
orientation O
is O
easy O
. O

It O
keeps O
my O
body O
cooler O
while O
isolating O
me O
from O
my O
Notebook O
but O
also O
gives O
a O
overall O
firmer O
support O
and O
comfort O
. O

Works O
great O
with O
my O
iPod O
Nano O
, O
but O
only O
the O
older O
V1 O
and O
V2 O
. O

For O
what O
it O
is O
worth O
, O
when O
the O
first O
power O
adapter O
stopped O
working O
, O
all O
of O
the O
data O
was O
still O
on O
the O
MAXTOR O
, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
replacement O
power O
source O
. O

First O
let O
me O
vent O
a O
little O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
2 O
TB O
Western O
Digital O
SATA O
drive O
and O
after O
the O
long O
formatting O
process O

The O
speakers O
are O
also O
decent O
and O
can O
get O
very O
loud O
. O

The O
product O
itself O
looks O
solid O
and O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
look O
and O
feel O
of O
it O
. O

Just O
for O
the O
record O
, O
I O
am O
a O
user O
of O
both O
PCs O
( O
Dell O
& O
HP O
) O
and O
Macs O
. O

Therefore O
this O
mouse O
CANNOT O
BE O
USED O
FOR O
PRESENTATIONS O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
that O
bad O
. O

Able O
to O
sync O
it O
and O
use O
it O
at O
home O
one O
time O
before O
getting O
on O
a O
plane O
sans O
laptop O
for O
6 O
days O
travel O
. O

I O
had O
much O
higher O
hopes O
. O

4 O
inch O
screen O
, O
3 O
lb O
weight O
and O
all O
the O
ports O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
's O
really O
going O
to O
protect O
it O
like O
a O
Otterbox O
with O
some O
level O
of O
shock O
protection O
( O
which O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
) O
. O

So O
another O
small O
deduction O
in O
rating O
. O

I O
returned O
to O
Amazon O
. O

I O
've O
fiddled O
with O
it O
nonstop O
for O
about O
5 O
hours O
and O
have O
come O
away O
quite O
pleased O
. O

A O
caveat O
and O
a O
suggestion O
: O
1 O
) O

In O
the O
end O
, O
it O
makes O
the O
difference O
between O
being O
able O
to O
functionally O
use O
your O
laptop O
. O

Recommended O
for O
either O
purpose O
. O

The O
attached O
dc O
cable O
seems O
a O
bit O
shorter O
than O
the O
original O
, O
but O
is O
still O
sufficient O
. O

No O
problems O
so O
far O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
have O
zero O
complaints O
about O
this O
keyboard O
. O

This O
charger O
is O
bigger O
and O
heavier O
than O
the O
stock O
charger O
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
, O
but O
as O
a O
keep O
- O
at O
- O
home O
spare O
this O
item O
works O
well O
. O

The O
computer O
boots O
fast O
and O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
use O
. O

Like O
I O
mentioned O
, O
this O
laptop O
may O
seem O
a O
little O
slow O
to O
some O
, O
to O
others O
it O
may O
not O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
strong O
build O
. O

Holding O
my O
breath O
a O
bit O
I O
got O
another O
unit O
in O
replacement O
of O
the O
first O
and O
this O
is O
working O
flawlessly O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
just O
put O
a O
small O
weight O
on O
the O
wire O
running O
across O
my O
front O
table O
so O
it O
stays O
put O
. O

but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
17 O
" O
consider O
something O
else O
if O
keeping O
the O
computer O
in O
place O
is O
important O
to O
you O
. O

There O
is O
one O
zipper O
that O
opens O
the O
outside O
pocket O
. O

My O
old O
( O
original O
) O
battery O
would O
not O
hold O
a O
charge O
for O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
; O
so O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
time O
to O
get O
a O
new O
one O
! O

Can O
you O
just O
get O
me O
to O
the O
right O

It O
took O
a O
few O
days O
to O
get O
use O
to O
Windows O
8 O
( O
coming O
from O
XP O
& O
7 O
) O
but O
8 O
is O
better O
.... O

Good O
product O
, O
good O
price O

The O
build O
quality O
is O
great O
; O
unlike O
other O
units O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
unplugged O
easily O
. O

The O
handle O
straps O
are O
strong O
and O
the O
case O
as O
a O
whole O
seems O
well O
made O
. O

By O
optimizing O
windows O
you O
can O
speed O
up O
the O
machine O
to O
more O
efficiently O
utilize O
the O

. O

The O
padding O
provides O
a O
lot O
of O
security O
and O
cushion O
for O
the O
cameras O
and O
lenses O
; O
I O
've O
dropped O
the O
backpack O
a O
few O
times O
and O
the O
equipment O
have O
remained O
safe O
and O
are O
still O
in O
perfect O
working O
condition O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
useful O
link O
about O
using O
it O
as O
a O
family O
orgainizer O
or O
kitchen O
computer O
: O
[ O
... O
] O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
also O
, O
there O
is O
a O
somewhat O
limited O
ability O
to O
change O
the O
names O
of O
inputs O
as O
they O
appear O
on O
the O
on O
- O
screen O
menu O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
to O
own O
and O
all O
of O
the O
reports O
say O
that O
Asus O
is O
at O
the O
top O
in O
terms O
of O
reliability O
. O

Therefore O
, O
this O
review O
is O
specifically O
for O
the O
CHILL O
PAD O
aka O
CHILL O
MAT O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
could O
fix O
it O
myself O
with O
glue O
I O
suppose O
but O
that O
would O
void O
the O
warranty- O
right O
? O

Knowing O
that O
they O
would O
come O
I O
already O
got O
my O
old O
speakers O
home O
ready O
to O
connect O
these O
ones O
the O
next O
morning O
in O
the O
office O
( O
where O
I O
can O
sometimes O
later O
in O
the O
day O
use O
the O
speakers O
- O
and O
on O
the O
weekend O
) O
. O

This O
is O
much O
more O
portable O
than O
the O
AC O
power O
supply O
required O
versions O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
speaker O
not O
only O
looks O
cool O
, O
but O
it O
performs O
well O
. O

I O
'm O
currently O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
long O
the O
battery O
on O
it O
actually O
lasts O
since O
I O
've O
only O
used O
it O
plugged O
in O
so O
far O
. O

This O
might O
be O
the O
result O
of O
running O
other O
operations O
in O
the O
background O
, O
but O
it O
took O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
each O
of O
these O
two O
programs O
to O
successfully O
install O
. O

if O
I O
was O
n't O
sure O
that O
this O
thing O
will O
outlast O
me O
, O
I O
would O
buy O
2 O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
check O
your O
laptop O
dimensions O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
is O
enough O
room O
in O
the O
plastic O
case O
( O

. O

; O

Everything O
I O
have O
purchased O
from O
them O
has O
worked O
as O
advertised O
and O
was O
competitively O
priced O
. O

It O
charges O
quickly O
and O
runs O
for O
a O
good O
long O
time O
on O
a O
charge O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
when O
firing O
it O
up O
was O
run O
a O
dead O
pixel O
test O
. O

I O
would O
have O
given O
this O
thing O
perfect O
reviews O
EXCEPT O
.... O

( O
I O
imagine O
buffering O
and O
connections O
could O
change O
this O
, O
but O
works O
great O
for O
me O
.Works O
while O
plugged O
in O
and O
chargingOnly O
problem O
I O
have O

but O
it O
's O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

ha O
fits O
like O
a O
glove O
, O
It O
also O
has O
a O
pouch O
to O
store O
ac O
cord O
, O
mouse O
, O
or O
flash O
drive O
. O

I O
suppose O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
much O
, O
because O
its O
best O
to O
remove O
those O
stickers O
as O
they O
take O
away O
the O
design O
anyhow O
. O

I O
use O
the O
triple O
flange O
sleeves O
and O
regularly O
listen O
to O
my O
iPod O
on O
airplanes O
with O
the O
volume O
set O
at O
about O
1/8th O
and O
hear O
my O
music O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
noticed O
the O
new O
radios O
dropped O
$ O
40 O
in O
price O
form O
$ O
300 O
to O
$ O
260 O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
was O
a O
cute O
little O
device O
with O
lots O
of O
promise O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
meant O
for O
medium O
- O
heavy O
use O
. O

I O
Highly O
recommend O
this O
bag O
and O
Chrome O
also O
makes O
different O
kinds O
of O
bags O
not O
only O
this O
type O
but O
also O
for O
different O
applications O
.... O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
pinpoint O
because O
if O
you O
unplug O
and O
re O
- O
plug O
the O
original O
adapter O
, O
it O
will O
generally O
start O
charging O
the O
battery O
. O

There O
really O
is O
n't O
much O
padding O
inside O
the O
case O

It O
's O
a O
long O
, O
thin O
base O
( O
where O
the O
wireless O
handset O
sits O
) O
with O
a O
place O
to O
slip O
your O
iPhone O
onto O
a O
charger O
in O
the O
upright O
position O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Just O
got O
this O
today O
at O
Best O
Buy O
for O
$ O
379 O
and O
I O
'm O
using O
the O
Adobe O
Suite O
of O
products O
, O
particularly O
Illustrator O
and O
Photoshop O
. O

Also O
connects O
to O
my O
Galaxy O
S3 O
phone O
fine O
. O

so O
I O
am O
incredibly O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

but O
there O
's O
a O
pouch O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
bag O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
hard O
to O
reach O

and O
she O
's O
still O
using O
it O
. O

but O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
second O
chance O
doing O
what O
I O
did O
with O
my O
Powerbook O
, O
Macbook O
, O
Macbook O
Pro O
old O
and O
new O
... O

The O
hard O
drive O
will O
still O
spin O
down O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
to O
. O

The O
cases O
are O
very O
sturdy O
and O
fit O
very O
well O
. O

If O
what O
you O
need O
is O
a O
cordless O
mouse O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
get O
much O
better O
than O
this._________________________________________________________________THE O
EXTENDED O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
great O
highs O
, O
mids O
and O
a O
very O
good O
sounding O
speaker O
phone O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
highly O
, O
especially O
at O
~$63 O
or O
less O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
pick O
it O
up O
for O
on O
Amazon O
! O

Have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
use O
the O
keyboard O
, O
just O
been O
able O
to O
carry O
around O
the O
case O
with O
the O
tablet O
inside O
. O

Or O
my O
microwave O
needs O
to O
be O
shielded O
better O
. O

There O
are O
many O
many O
pockets O
on O
this O
bag O
and O
the O
zippers O
are O
great O
. O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard O
is O
definitely O
enjoyable O
. O

That O
was O
a O
huge O
consideration O
when O
I O
bought O
this O
baby O
computer O
, O
and O
it O
has O
served O
me O
well O
. O

The O
eyecup O
also O
helps O
me O
with O
smudges O
on O
my O
glasses O
, O
the O
eyepiece O
touches O
the O
glasses O
but O
very O
rarely O
smudges O
the O
glasses O
so O
this O
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
a O
battery O
of O
tests O
I O
run O
to O
gauge O
the O
performance O
of O
machines O
, O
and O
this O
one O
did O
about O
what O
I O
expected O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
touch O
screen O
laptop O
and O
I O
did O
not O
want O
one O
, O
but O

The O
VPHD O
is O
a O
capable O
hard O
drive O
. O

The O
touch O
of O
color O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
waste O
. O

The O
stereo O
microphone O
is O
a O
good O
touch O
and O
seems O
very O
clear O
. O

We O
are O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
, O
our O
first O
venture O
in O
to O
wide O
screen O
T. O
V O
's O
. O

It O
will O
help O
keep O
your O
operating O
drive O
free O
of O
clutter O
and O
also O
add O
a O
layer O
of O
protection O
for O
your O
personal O
files O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
film O
goes O
on O
in O
about O
1 O
min O
. O

Since O
I O
've O
read O
all O
reviews O
in O
Amazon O
, O
I O
knew O
that O
the O
presentation O
would O
be O
great O
, O
and O
sure O
enough O
, O
it O
was O
nothing O
like O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

bottom O
is O
cloth O
and O
comfy O
on O
lap O
although O
i O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
this O
way O
extensively O
. O

The O
speaker O
is O
rated O
at O
up O
to O
12 O
hours O
of O
playback O
on O
one O
charge O
. O

, O
that O
has O
a O
phone O
app O
. O

I O
do O
wish O
the O
Kinivo O
BTX180 O
had O
the O
option O
to O
pair O
two O
for O
stereo O
sound O
. O

Order O
replacement O
and O
found O
they O
have O
winced O
changed O
the O
type O
of O
charger O
included O
. O

I O
think O
the O
plastic O
is O
a O
little O
on O
the O
cheap O
side O
but O
only O
time O
will O
tell O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
durability O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

I O
have O
used O
it O
with O
Skype O
and O
with O
Microsoft O
Lync O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
middle O
jack O
would O
work O
. O

The O
Nano O
receiver O
is O
simply O
awesome O
. O

Touch O
Screen O
works O
very O
well O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
its O
a O
great O
buy O
. O

I O
was O
just O
told O
for O
the O
umpteenth O
time O
, O
by O
my O
wife O
, O
to O
turn O
the O
dang O
speaker O
down O
as O
she O
can O
not O
think O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
it O
did O
have O
a O
strong O
rubbery O
smell O
to O
it O
, O
though O
I O
imagine O
that O
would O
dissipate O
over O
time O
. O

A O
vast O
improvement O
for O
virtually O
all O
applications O
. O

However O
, O
the O
bottom O
- O
line O
word O
here O
is O
decent O
sound O
, O
not O
fabulous O
, O
incredible O
sound O
like O
some O
of O
the O
reviewers O
have O
described O
this O
thing O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
short O
and O
not O
ideal O
for O
computers O
under O
the O
desk O
or O
out O
of O
reach O
. O

I O
've O
been O
through O
so O
much O
with O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
is O
just O
plain O
ridiculous O
. O

This O
monitor O
was O
the O
most O
expensive O
part O
of O
my O
build O
, O
and O
although O
they O
allow O
for O
up O
to O
5 O
dead O
pixels O
before O
offering O
an O
exchange O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
none O
. O

Those O
both O
looked O
great O
. O

- O
The O
500 O
GB O
drive O
is O
far O
more O
space O
than O
most O
users O
need O
( O
few O
people O
will O
use O
more O
than O
100 O
GB O
) O
. O

It O
might O
be O
a O
con O
for O
some O
people O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
going O
directly O
to O
the O
install O
file O
on O
the O
DVD O
( O
CD O
? O
) O
and O
double O
clicking O
on O
it O
from O
there O
( O
explore O
) O
. O

so O
I O
took O
a O
chance O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
stereo O
Headphone O
extension O

to O
have O
at O

not O
so O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
in O
and O
out O
of O
it O
easily O
, O
and O
you O
are O
also O
carrying O
a O
backpack O
etc O
. O

It O
worked O
well O
and O
allowed O
me O
to O
transfer O
high O
quality O
video O
from O
my O
computer O
to O
my O
tv O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
LowePro O
excels O
in O
the O
roller O
design O
category O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
satisfied O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

I O
find O
the O
polycarb O
actually O
uncomfortable O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
( O
and O
buffer O
the O
heat O
with O
a O
pillow O
) O
but O
can O
use O
the O
Pro O
on O
my O
lap O
for O
hours O
. O

The O
unit O
comes O
with O
a O
remote O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
so O
ca O
n't O
report O
on O
that O
. O

I O
use O
this O
adapter O
to O
transfer O
photos O
from O
my O
phones O
and O
tablet O
to O
a O
flash O
drive O
. O

and O
I O
run O
a O
lot O
of O
programs O
, O
use O
wifi O
, O
and O
watch O
video O
pretty O
consistently O
. O

And O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
's O
all O
- O
black O
, O
except O
for O
the O
little O
, O
cute O
red O
square O
with O
the O
Swiss O
cross O
logo O
. O

Overall O
I O
m O
please O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
normal O
since O

is O
n't O
used O
that O
often O

At O
first O
I O
really O
could O
n't O
think O
of O
any O
reason O
to O
use O
the O

I O

your O

any O

you O
want O

Maybe O
it O
will O
actually O
last O
longer O

I O
ended O
up O
splicing O
the O

It O

of O
the O
straps O
do O
not O
get O
used O
because O
they O
are O
covered O
, O
which O
really O
does O
n't O
effect O
my O
overall O
opinion O

But O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

Plus O
the O
gigabit O
does O
seem O
faster O
as O
well O
so O
far O
loving O
it O
on O
day O
one O
again O
Thanks O

Set O
it O
up O
once O
, O
and O
sharing O
your O
screen O
is O
as O
easy O
as O
pushing O
a O
button O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
do O
the O
job O
well O

Nothing O
special O

for O
the O

I O
like O
to O
carry O
my O
MacBook O
like O
an O
attache O
, O
by O
my O
side O
. O

since O
the O
Belkin O
has O
2 O

ports O
? O

And O
, O
if O
they O
look O
good O
, O
all O
the O
better O
. O

The O
item O
works O
as O
described O
and O
has O
not O
had O
ANY O
issues O
. O

I O
can O
not O
comment O
on O
the O
reliability O
of O
the O
product O
because O
I O
just O
got O
it O
today O
. O

do O
nt O
waste O
your O
money O
it O
works O
ok O
to O
start O
with O
then O
goes O
down O
hill O
fast O
and O
is O
to O
slowsave O
your O
money O
and O
get O
a O

upgrade O

I O
tried O
this O
adapter O
in O
win O
7 O
pc O
and O
the O
OS O
did O
nt O
recognize O
it O
, O
then O
I O
left O
it O
... O

The O
wire O
for O
the O
plug O
comes O
out O
the O
side O
and O
can O
block O
whatever O
plug O
is O
next O
to O
it O
. O

but O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
know O
you O
have O
it O
for O
those O
3 O
. O
5 O
occasions O

we O
ordered O
another O
one O
and O
it O
did O
not O
work O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
set O
of O
these O
RAMs O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
to O
replace O
the O
stock O
RAM O
on O
my O
2011 O
MBP O
, O
still O
works O
perfectly O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
any O
happier O
. O

I O
charged O
it O
up O
on O
Friday O
when O
I O
unboxed O
it O
, O
then O
unplugged O
it O
. O

Never O
got O
more O
than O
4 O
bars O
with O
other O
products O
, O
this O
one O
is O
never O
less O
than O
5 O
which O
has O
resulted O
in O
lightning O
quick O
Internet O
browsing O
. O

Large O
enough O
that O
it O
's O
not O
likely O
to O
come O
out O
with O
me O
on O
most O
photo O
trips O
, O
but O
only O
the O
ones O
where O
I O
feel O
a O
need O
to O
take O
my O
whole O
collection O
of O
naturalist O
and O
photo O
gear O
with O
me O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
mouse O
to O
use O
with O
my O
laptop O
as O
the O
finger O
pad O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
butt O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
one O
.... O
which O
i O
guess O
means O
I O
like O
it O
, O
right O
? O

I O
did O
not O
test O
using O
an O
external O
keyboard O
, O
I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
. O

I O
works O
Great O
, O
and O
the O
fans O
are O
pretty O
quiet O
. O

In O
sum O
, O
here O
are O
my O
main O
observations O
about O
the O
Toshiba O
: O

While O
you O
can O
see O
a O
reflection O
, O
we O
found O
it O
not O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

Do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
through O
that O
experience O
again O
EVER O
. O

Have O
had O
2 O
of O
these O
plus O
3 O
Aux O
to O
Aux O
fromMediabridge O
and O
they O
are O
awesome O
. O

I O
got O
it O
very O
quickly O
and O
it O
was O
as O
described O
. O

October O
12 O
, O
2012The O
original O
battery O
in O
my O
HP O
laptop O
had O
a O
sticker O
saying O
, O
" O
REPLACE O
WITH O
HP O
SPARE O
480385 O
- O
001 O
" O
. O

The O
idea O
is O
great O
. O

If O
you O
're O
not O
careful O
, O
you O
could O
burn O
yourself O
while O
its O
charging O
. O

Addendum O
: O
When O
I O
tried O
it O
in O
Argentina O
it O
was O
2 O
months O
old O
, O
tried O
it O
again O
in O
Australia O
- O
New O
Zealand O
and O
still O
did O
n't O
work O
, O
so O
basically O
took O
up O
space O
and O
useless O
. O

but O
, O
the O
Windows O
7 O
language O
is O
only O
in O
english O
and O
there O
are O
no O
way O
to O
change O
. O

Everyone O
who O
is O
into O
electronic O
media O
will O
want O
one O
of O
these O

The O

Just O
what O
I O

There O

Will O
buy O

this O
one O
fails O
. O

Comfort O

, O
they O
are O
not O

not O

You O
'll O
have O

" O

that O

the O
1997 O
slogan O

for O
Apple O

comeback O
to O
the O
world O
of O
serious O
computing O
after O
the O
return O
of O
Steve O

, O
and O
perhaps O
it O
was O
a O
cynical O
reference O
to O
IBM O

famous O
" O

slogan O
. O

At O
full O

, O
I O
can O
hear O

but O
it O
certainly O
is O
n't O
obtrusive O
unless O
you O
are O
in O

I O
would O

This O

This O
feature O
is O
highly O
applauded O
... O
by O
me O
at O
least O
. O

These O
products O
arrived O
as O
promised O
, O
packed O
neatly O
in O
nice O
boxes O
for O
protection O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
I O
will O
have O
to O
return O
the O
battery O
. O

Having O
cables O
like O
this O
one O
custom O
made O
with O
quality O
materials O
is O
prohibitive O
( O
or O
time O
consuming O
, O
if O
your O
schedule O
is O
crammed O
) O
so O

( O
No O
NFC O
testing O
) O

So O
I O
ended O
up O
trying O
some O
drivers O
one O
by O
one O
that O
I O
had O
not O
installed O
. O

I O
like O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
to O
use O
a O
USB O
port O
or O
have O
moving O
fans O
that O
can O
get O
caught O
on O
things O
. O

It O
offers O
several O
little O
pockets O
. O

Let O
me O
first O
start O
off O
by O
telling O
you O
that O
before O
my O
first O
Mac O
, O
which O
was O
this O
mac O
, O
I O
was O
a O
PC O
owner O
because O
that O
was O
what O
was O
available O
for O
my O
budget O
. O

CEVA O
people O
were O
great O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
surge O
protector O
to O
use O
with O
my O
laptop O
, O
which O
comes O
with O
2 O
bonus O
USB O
hook O
up O
for O
charging O
USB O
devices O
( O
some O
mp3 O
player O
, O
and O
cell O
phones O
, O
etc O
) O

We O
got O
this O
for O
a O
heavy O
computer O
that O
does O
n't O
move O
much O
. O

What O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
to O
work O
, O
like O
Microsoft O
Power O
Toys O
RAW O
viewer O
, O
I O
'll O
chalk O
up O
to O
my O
general O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
of O
Windows O
. O

After O
reading O
reviews O
of O
having O
Amazon O
ship O
an O
HDTV O
decided O
to O
go O
that O
way O
. O

I O
just O
let O
this O
device O
be O
alone O
on O
the O
USB O
channel O
now O
. O

I O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
or O
seen O
this O
brand O
before O
, O
but O
I O
was O
immediately O
impressed O
with O
the O
pictures O
of O
it O
, O
the O
specs O
and O
of O
course O
the O
price O
compared O
to O
similar O
models O
from O
more O
recognized O
name O
brands O
. O

This O
causes O
programs O
to O
take O
a O
little O
bit O
longer O
to O
load O
, O
but O
once O
your O
browser O
or O
word O
processor O
boots O
up O
, O
there O
is O
no O
delay O
while O
working O
. O

Whoever O
says O
these O
are O
rich O
in O
bass O
, O
are O
you O
kidding O
? O

I O
play O
my O
games O
on O
FB O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

5V O

So O
you O
get O
sound O
bouncing O
off O
the O
walls O
and O
you O
can O
hear O
it O
from O
all O
directions O
.. O

And O
, O
it O
only O
has O
a O
single O
band O
( O
2 O
. O
4 O
GHz O
) O

I O
did O
n't O
find O
it O
troubling O
. O

It O
came O
out O
of O
the O
box O
with O
the O
backing O
half O
off O
and O
covered O
with O
dust O
that O
would O
prevent O
it O
from O
sticking O
completely O
to O
any O
surface O
. O

If O
you O
want O
THE O
BEST O
, O
this O
is O
it O
. O

this O
is O
mini O
speaker O
, O
but O
sounds O
really O
good O
. O

Just O
be O
sure O
you O
line O
up O
all O
the O
pins O
correctly O
( O
and O
the O
right O
way O
up O
) O
. O

The O
wi O
- O
fi O
internet O
is O
sort O
of O
an O
afterthought O
. O

On O
the O
very O
top O
of O
this O
" O
lid O
" O
is O
another O
zipper O
to O
access O
your O
camera O
and O
other O
gear O
in O
a O
flash O
. O

For O
example O
, O
you O
may O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
grab O
the O
scrollbars O
on O
the O
browser O
, O
or O
read O
small O
text O
. O

Keys O
on O
keyboard O
have O
to O
really O
be O
hit O
to O
make O
work O
, O
this O
would O
be O
something O
Dell O
needs O
to O
improve O
on O
or O
, O
maybe O
the O
reason O
why O
they O
were O
less O
money O
. O

My O
micro O
card O
fits O
, O
the O
transfer O
rate O
is O
nothing O
special O
but O
I O
use O
it O
as O
one O
of O
my O
backup O
drives O
, O
so O
speed O
is O
n't O
really O
important O
. O

Great O
customer O
service O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
of O
quality O
, O
I O
seek O
out O
your O
brand O
name O
over O
all O
others O
at O
Amazon O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
a O
Perfectionist O
! O
! O

Anyways O
, O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
getting O
a O
Macbook O
with O
at O
least O
an O
i5 O
processor O
. O

Even O
now O
, O
whenever O
my O
hand O
hoovers O
over O
the O
mouse O
pad O
, O
the O
typing O
tool O
gets O
navigated O
to O
a O
different O
location O
, O
so O
I O
have O
to O
keep O
putting O
it O
back O
to O
where O
I O
am O
typing O
( O
if O
you O
have O
to O
write O
a O
lot O
, O
this O
keypad O
will O
annoy O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
you O
) O
. O

I O
've O
been O
too O
busy O
and O
to O
sick O
or O
f O
- O
ing O
with O
my O
technology O
to O
fight O
with O
them O
. O

Worked O
great O
for O
us O
. O

BETTER O
LUCK O

This O
is O
a O
repeat O
problem O
with O
every O
one O
of O
their O
cords O
. O

Let O
's O
face O
it O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
buy O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
, O
so O
you O
can O
buy O
a O
huge O
case O
, O
you O
get O
the O
Air O
because O
it O
's O
light O
and O
portable O
. O

A O
VERY O
GOOD O
PRICE O
. O

USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
is O
n't O
slow O
, O
but O
not O
quite O
as O
fast O
as O
firewire O
. O

Easy O
to O
set O
up O
and O
use O
, O
this O
relatively O
small O
speaker O
connects O
either O
through O
Bluetooth O
or O
cable O
( O
included O
) O
. O

and O
I O
really O
like O
the O
two O
, O
larger O
interior O
zippered O
pockets O
that O
keep O
my O
important O
items O
in O
place O
and O
a O
little O
more O
protected O
. O

It O
lasted O
5 O
months O
connecting O
me O
to O
the O
computer O
a O
few O
feet O
away O
. O

They O
are O
all O
going O
to O
cost O
from O
0 O
. O
01 O
to O
$ O
1 O
. O
00 O

I O
use O
this O
everyday O
! O

I O
asked O
for O
just O
the O
headset O
to O
be O
repaired O
, O
and O
they O
sent O
me O
an O
entire O
brand O
new O
headset O
, O
charger O
, O
etc O
.... O

When O
I O
ordered O
the O
pack O
I O
wanted O
something O
to O
carry O
my O
Nikon O
D2X O
with O
a O
Nikkor O
28 O
- O

f/2 O
. O

All O
she O
really O
needs O
. O

Microsoft O
does O
n't O
deserve O
to O
own O
the O
world O
. O

The O
price O
was O
excellent O
, O
the O
shipping O
fast O
, O
and O
the O
set O
- O
up O
easy O
. O

When O
I O
say O
died O
I O
mean O
" O
shattered O
into O
a O
thousand O
tiny O
pieces O
throughout O
the O
entire O
TV O
cabinet O
" O
. O

The O
fans O
do O
n't O
like O
they O
push O
THAT O
much O
air O
, O
but O
it O
does O
feel O
pretty O
cool O
under O
there O
. O

Big O
disappointment O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

I O
love O
it O
but O
a O
bit O
expensive O
. O

It O
does O
everything O
I O
intended O
for O
it O
, O
but O
since O
I O
'm O
starting O
to O
get O
into O
high O
- O
performance O
software O
, O
I O
need O
to O
get O
high O
- O
performance O
hardware O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
full O
size O
keyboard O
too O
small O
to O
type O
with O
but O
great O
to O
hand O
peck O
at O
it O
. O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
difference O
. O

so O
wires O
do O
n't O
get O
in O
your O
way O
. O

does O
n't O
have O
to O
hang O
off O
the O
side O
or O
front O
of O
your O
computer O
. O

This O
may O
be O
because O
they O
take O
longer O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
hoping O
it O
is O
because O
the O
keys O
are O
n't O
actually O
high O
enough O
to O
touch O
the O
screen O
when O
the O
laptop O
is O
closed O

video O
and O
dimmed O
screen O
will O
give O
you O
under O
5 O
hours O
) O
, O
a O
nice O
screen O
, O
a O
palatable O
keyboard O
, O
a O
reasonable O
although O
by O
no O
means O
comprehensive O
set O
of O
ports O
, O
and O
an O
infuriating O
track O
pad O
that O
causes O
your O
typing O
to O
jump O
around O
. O

I O
did O
not O
realize O
it O
myself O
until O
earlier O
today O
when O
I O
visited O
their O
site O
. O

The O
result O
of O
this O
is O
that O
it O
's O
too O
easy O
for O
ones O
palms O
to O
inadvertently O
touch O
the O
pad O
while O
typing O
. O

Disappointed O
and O
wished O
I O
would O
have O
sprung O
for O
the O
original O
HP O
battery O
instead O
. O

It O
's O
frustrating O
that O
even O
though O
you O
do O
due O
diligence O
in O
making O
sure O
that O
the O
product O
you O
take O
the O
trouble O
to O
buy O
ends O
up O
not O
being O
as O
advertised O
and O
YOU O
have O
to O
take O
the O
time O
and O
expense O
to O
return O
it O
. O

The O
weak O
points O
are O
the O
backpack O
straps O
get O
in O
the O
way O
of O
accessing O
the O
laptop O
compartment O
and O
need O
to O
be O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
way O
-- O
not O
a O
big O
problem O
but O
prevents O
a O
5-star O
rating O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
good O
commuting O
backpack O
. O

The O
devices O
believe O
they O
are O
on O
wall O
outlet O
power O
when O
connected O
via O
the O
adapter O
and O
this O
cable O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
really O
great O
for O
the O
price O
- O
not O
only O
HD O
, O
but O
LED O
to O
boot O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
on O
many O
occasions O
to O
hold O
down O
the O
home O
button O
on O
the O
iPhone O
only O
to O
have O
the O
response O
beep O
be O
silent O
or O
come O
through O
the O
Moshi O
handset O
. O

AC O
, O
USB O
, O
and O
vehicle O
cigarette O
lighter O
. O

I O
have O
concerns O
about O
leaving O
the O
' O
clock O
' O
on O
display O
in O
the O
Kindle O
. O

Instead O
of O
weird O
Bluetooth O
earbuds O
with O
heavy O
batteries O
hanging O
in O
my O
ear O
, O
I O
clip O
this O
to O
my O
waist O
and O
wear O
whatever O
headphones O
I O
want O
( O
the O
buds O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
are O
not O
terrible O
) O
. O

I O
have O
a O
17 O
" O
Laptop O
Case O
and O
it O
barley O
fits O
just O
snug O
in O
there O

This O
is O
a O
much O
better O
idea O
for O
transporting O
because O
the O
drive O
is O
protected O
in O
the O
case O
. O

used O
this O
product O
on O
my O
last O
macbook O
. O

I O
had O
no O
issues O
using O
this O
on O
old O
Dell O
. O

I O
have O
2 O
other O
telescopes O
I O
bought O
at O
yard O
sales O
, O
I O
think O
I O
will O
stick O
with O
those O
! O
! O

but O
just O
could O
n't O
make O
it O
work O
. O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
laptop O
with O
a O
super O
bright O
screen O
, O
and O
amazing O
battery O
life O
. O

This O
is O
great O
for O
the O
coffee O
table O
, O
or O
desk O
. O

If O
I O
was O
going O
to O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
keyboarding O
, O
I O
think O
I O
would O
look O
at O
the O
Acer O
or O
Dell O
netbooks O
. O

PS- O
The O
charger O
is O
labeled O
as O
19 O
. O

It O
has O
n't O
failed O
or O
disappointed O
in O
its O
performance O
; O
and O
it O
runs O
considerably O
faster O
, O
even O
loaded O
with O
my O
preferred O
software O
( O
MS O
Office O
suite O
and O
five O
troubleshooting O
/ O
maintenance O
programs O
) O
than O
my O
former O
laptop O
, O
an O
IBM O
R50e O
. O

She O
loves O
using O
the O
Anker O
BT O
keyboard O
too O
and O
like O
the O
& O
# O
34;feel&#34 O
; O
for O
fast O
tough O
typing O
taking O
notes O
at O
meetings O
or O
working O
in O
away O
travel O
situations O
. O

And O
entering O
a O
question O
mark O
is O
even O
more O
difficult O
, O
since O
that O
key O
is O
even O
smaller O
than O
the O
right O
shift O
- O
and O
they O
're O
both O
next O
to O
each O
other O
! O

so O
hopefully O
they O
were O
n't O
so O
necessary O
. O

Tried O
this O
regardless O
of O
the O
negative O
reviews O
. O

there O
are O
some O

, O
even O
with O

I O
use O

it O
works O

It O
keeps O

an O
inch O

off O

I O
can O
definitely O

did O
not O

a O

. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
case O
for O
the O
Mac O
Air O
11 O
. O

it O
works O
with O
my O
Dell O
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
type O
of O
construction O
that O
makes O
me O
wary O
that O
it O
will O
start O
a O
fire O
. O

Decided O
to O
get O
the O
case O
to O
help O
protect O
the O
exterior O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
handles O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
fairly O
sturdy O
shoulder O
strap O
as O
well O
as O
sufficient O
additional O
pocket O
storage O
for O
her O
power O
brick O
and O
accessories O
without O
adding O
unnecessary O
bulk O
nor O
weight O

Some O

ca O
n't O
handle O
one O

Ordered O
by O
mistake O
( O
meant O
to O
get O
the O

it O
ended O
up O

suspect O
this O
is O
more O
a O
problem O
inherent O
to O
this O
make O

if O
you O
are O
a O

and O
using O

Simply O
remove O

put O
this O

over O

Perhaps O
that O
would O
be O
its O
useful O
scenario O
-- O
adding O
slightly O
to O
the O

perhaps O

A O
friend O
told O
me O
to O
look O
into O
the O
chrome O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

I O
used O
this O
cable O
to O
connect O
my O
PC O
to O
the O
TV O
via O
the O
DVI O
port O
from O
my O
intergrated O
graphics O
( O
Intel O

) O
and O
my O
main O
monitor O
via O
my O

. O

Another O
textbook O
of O
similar O
size O
can O
be O
carried O
in O
place O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

The O
two O
deciding O
factors O
for O
me O
were O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
pay O
extra O
for O
bluetooth O

Outlook O
Express O
apparently O
is O
one O
, O
in O
which O
it O
will O
only O
scroll O
vertically O
. O

It O
looks O
terrible O
. O

but O
it O
's O
either O
on O
my O
desk O

After O
testing O
the O
monitor O
on O
monitor O
testing O
sites O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
entirely O
sure O
how O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
the O
advertised O
2ms O
response O
time O
makes O
. O

Pros- O
well O
built O
, O
well O
made O
, O
I O
would O
not O
say O
with O
high O
quality O
materials O
because O
the O
cable O
itself O
has O
some O
generic O
writing O
on O
it O
, O
which O
makes O
looks O
little O
bit O
& O
# O
34;cheap O
- O
ish.&#34;Neutral- O

This O
is O
good O
for O
storing O
the O
laptop O
, O
files O
, O
and O
even O
basic O
necessities O
, O
but O
shoes O
/ O
clothes O
- O
not O
so O
much O
. O

So O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
Sony O
Bravias O
and O
if O
you O
try O
to O
compare O
them O
, O
do O
n't O
bother O
, O
the O
Vizios O
i O
have O
seen O
people O
have O
even O
far O
surpass O
the O
Sony O
, O
and O
even O
though O
i O
'm O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
them O

It O
tracks O
perfectly O
even O
on O
some O
glossy O
surfaces O
that O
gave O
my O
old O
V220 O
and O
another O
Kensington O
mouse O
problems O
. O

This O
was O
certainly O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

The O
USB O
ports O
will O
all O
charge O
your O
phone O
even O
while O
the O
laptop O
is O
sleeping O
or O
shutdown O
, O
although O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
port O
power O
is O
interrupted O
for O
a O
second O
if O
you O
close O
the O
lid O
to O
put O
it O
to O
sleep O
. O

This O
was O
purchased O
for O
our O
Church O
. O

I O
did O
read O
reviews O
of O
the O
product O
and O
figured O
it O
was O
worth O
a O
shot O
. O

I O
could O
get O
some O
reads O
from O
the O
Pogo O
on O
an O
HTC O
G1 O
, O
but O
this O
does O
n't O
even O
remotely O
work O
on O
a O
G1 O
and O
, O
as O
others O
have O
pointed O
out O
, O
barely O
works O
on O
the O
Apple O
devices O
. O

Might O
try O

it O
came O
in O

it O
was O
packed O
in O

which O
only O
had O

then O
went O
up O

The O
best O

I O
've O
seen O
manufactured O
( O
hard O

for O
the O
Macbook O

Sometimes O
a O
little O
laggy O

does O
the O
trick O

Easily O
holds O
5"x7 O
" O
sized O
papers O

cards O
, O
wallet O
, O
small O

It O
takes O
some O
time O
for O
Win O

Media O
to O
configure O
and O
find O
channels O
, O
once O
set O
up O
, O
works O
best O
. O

It O
has O
enough O
room O
in O
the O
main O
compartment O
for O
my O
15 O
. O
6 O

Interesting O
Asus O
design O
decision O
- O
relying O
on O
tape O
to O
ensure O
its O
flagship O
laptops O
power O
on O

I O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
I O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
as O
well O
. O

My O
step O
- O
daughter O
has O
this O
Chromebook O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
. O

Or O
I O
would O
go O
to O
scroll O
the O
scrollbar O
and O
it O
would O
n't O
budge O
and O
you O
'd O
have O
to O
smack O
it O
harder O

it O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
pleased O
with O
the O
combination O
of O
good O

I O
'd O

I O
have O
had O
several O
Acer O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
was O
satisfied O
with O
them O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
product O
because O
I O
needed O
an O
external O
DVD O
re O
- O
writer O
with O
LightScribe O
capabilities O
. O

It O
's O
a O
really O
nice O
case O
, O
but O
that O
's O
the O
trouble O
with O
new O
computers O
and O
fractional O
screen O
sizes O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
just O
a O
plastic O
holder O
with O
holes O
in O
it O
. O

Also O
transfers O
720P O

That O
's O
all O
you O
need O
to O
know O

The O
one O
thing O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
is O
a O
slot O
or O
place O
to O
put O
my O
business O
card O
under O
the O
pouch O
flap O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
color O

Never O
a O
problem O

was O
combined O
with O
a O
new O
battery O
also O
. O

So O
you O
can O
understand O
my O
frustration O
when O
I O
sit O
down O
and O
put O
the O
bag O
leaning O
on O
one O
of O
the O
chair O
's O
legs O
and O
it O
still O
falls O
off O
the O
other O
side O
anyway O
because O
the O
laptop O
and O
the O
books O
are O
too O
heavy O
. O

If O
only O
they O
had O
installed O
high O
quality O
fans O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
nearly O
perfect O
laptop O
stand O
. O

I O
had O
to O
find O
and O
buy O
a O
different O
cable O
. O

So O
I O
kept O
the O
awful O
bottom O
of O
the O
line O
( O
Averatec O
brand O
) O
laptop O
. O

and O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
scratching O
your O
shiny O
macbook O
while O
doing O
it O

Have O
to O
remove O
old O
faceplate O
on O
outlet O
if O
you O
want O
a O
flush O
finish O
. O

This O
exposes O
the O
top O
of O
the O
laptop O
with O
no O
padding O
above O
it O
, O
in O
any O
way O
. O

The O
craftsmanship O
of O
this O
laptop O
looks O
great O
, O
but O
after O
looking O
at O
it O
closely O
( O
after O
having O
it O
for O
couple O
of O
days O
now O
, O
) O
it O
seems O
like O
the O
opposite O
. O

On O
the O
upside O
, O
this O
offers O
a O
lot O
of O
protection O
as O
it O
's O
almost O
like O
an O
air O
sleeve O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
applies O
to O
all O
messenger O
style O
bags O
, O
as O
this O
is O
my O
first O
one O
, O
but O
it O
was O
quite O
annoying O
to O
me O
. O

The O
fit O
and O
finish O
are O
fine O
. O

This O
is O
with O
screen O
brightness O
around O
65 O
% O
which O
for O
me O
is O
adequate O
for O
note O
taking O
/ O
light O
browsing O
. O

lb O
laptop O
I O
have O
. O

Pens O
sit O
horizontal O
rather O
than O
vertical O
which O
avoids O
stress O
on O
them O
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
have O
my O
EQ O
set O
and O
it O
has O
enough O
bass O
to O
not O
be O
overpowering O
and O
the O
mids O
and O
highs O
have O
astonishing O
quality O
. O

There O
are O
n't O
many O
good O
power O
supplies O
that O
offer O
what O
the O
RG630 O
does O
for O
this O
cheap O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
bargain O
. O

but O
I O
prefer O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard O
sans O
cover O
, O
so O
your O
choice O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
actually O
use O
it O

For O
$ O

, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
think O
about O
moving O
a O
charger O
around O
, O
and O
I O
have O
a O
spare O
when O
the O
original O
craps O
out O
, O
which O
it O
did O
after O
a O
year O
. O

I O
've O
strapped O
my O
Slick O
tripod O
on O
, O
but O
it O
made O
the O
bag O
very O
uneven O
. O

Since O
it O
is O
very O
small O
it O
is O
also O
very O
portable O
. O

-- O
that O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
music O
! O
) O
. O

I O
love O
it O
though O
! O

It O
's O
held O
up O
well O
with O
no O
complaints O
. O

the O
pairing O
process O
took O
less O
than O
1 O
minute O
and O
it O
was O
really O
easy O
. O

My O
first O
second O
using O
it O

I O
purchased O
the O
black O
version O
with O
red O
stripes O
on O
the O
sides O
, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
looking O
mouse O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

I O
subtracted O
2 O

for O
that O
. O

So O
far O
the O
case O
has O
been O
very O
rugged O
and O
durable O
, O
with O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

My O
Laptop O
used O
to O
warn O
me O
when O
my O
battery O
was O
down O
to O
13 O
% O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
this O
laptop O
because O
I O
had O
ordered O
one O
for O
myself O
fo O
rschool O
. O

Perfect O
fit O
for O
my O
acer O
notebook O
computer O

What O
's O
strange O
is O
that O
the O
resolution O
in O
VMWARE O
Fusion O
would O
go O
past O
1280x800 O
without O
actually O
having O
to O
scroll O
off O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
with O
an O
ultrabook O
! O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
if O
it O
has O
the O
durability O
for O
daily O
long O
- O
term O
use O
. O

Pros:- O
Good O
simple O
efficient O
design.- O
Substantial O
padding O
and O
good O
quality O

It O
works O
wonderfully O
. O

Pros O
: O
Arrived O
quickly O
. O

There O
are O
two O
dividers O
in O
the O
main O
compartment O
, O
one O
for O
the O
laptop O
, O
and O
one O
for O
papers O
, O
notebooks O
, O
even O
larger O
books O
one O
may O
want O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

I O
used O
it O
on O
a O
Canonet O

which O
take O
a O
PX625 O

, O
the O

on O

and O
very O

, O
i O
mean O
a O

when O
you O
do O
heavy O
stuff O
, O
other O
than O
that O
it O
is O
cool O
below O
and O
on O
the O
keyboard O
, O
so O
hot O
area O
is O

It O
has O
been O
working O
well O
. O

Fits O
perfect O
on O
my O
new O
Macpro O
with O
retina O
display O
. O

Only O
two O
lines O
on O
aux O
jack O
( O
three O
lines O
is O
the O
" O
best O
quality O
" O
but O
I O
'm O
really O
not O
sure O
how O
important O
that O
is O
for O
a O
speaker O
this O
small- O

I O
am O
using O
this O
on O
my O
home O
theater O
to O
convert O
component O
from O
an O
Xbox O
and O
VGA O
from O
a O
laptop O
, O
that O
i O
'm O
using O
with O
Windows O
Media O
Center O
, O
and O
convert O
them O
to O
HDMI O
for O
my O
projector O
. O

For O
it O
's O
size O
, O
it O
is O
a O
decent O
grab O
- O
and O
- O
go O
speaker O
to O
plug O
your O
phone O
or O
mp3 O
player O
into O
, O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
power O
cords O
or O
taking O
up O
much O
space O
. O

A O
nine O
year O
old O
drive O
should O
cost O
less O
than O
$ O
48 O
. O

until O
i O
read O
in O
a O
forum O
. O

The O
SSD O
is O
sliced O
and O
diced O
into O
a O
bunch O
of O
partitions O
. O

It O
started O
looking O
ok O
. O

It O
lasts O
for O
an O
acceptable O
amount O
if O
time O
. O

It O
has O
USB O
and O
an O
SD O
card O
port O
. O

re O
these O
type O
of O
things O
. O

Apricorn O
HDD O
's O
are O
far O
superior O
IMHO O
. O

Just O
something O
to O
use O
the O
Internet O
and O
check O
e O
- O
mail O
. O

I O
replaced O
the O
original O
keyboard O
program O
with O
one O
from O
the O
Amazon O
marketplace O
. O

No O
complaints O
, O
although O
I O
only O
get O
75 O
MBPS O
when O
two O
floors O
above O
the O
router O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
really O
liking O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
clips O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
when O
I O
give O
this O
only O
4 O
stars O
. O

In O
comparison O
the O
Arc O
for O
the O
iPad O
is O
very O
very O
snug O
and O
works O
great O
. O

I O
also O
got O
one O
for O
my O
new O
TV O
to O
extend O
its O
life O
as O
the O
one O
it O
was O
replacing O
wore O
out O

It O
's O
not O
quite O
as O
" O
mini O
" O
as O
you O
might O
think O
, O
but O
it O
's O
still O
small O
and O
you O
could O
surely O
travel O
with O
it O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
( O
although O
you O
very O
well O
could O
still O
need O
a O
travel O
adapter O
. O
) O

It O
worked O
well O
but O
it O
fit O
in O
a O
little O
weird O
. O

The O
case O
is O
not O
as O
snug O
around O
the O
laptop O
as O
I O
would O
prefer O
, O
however O
it O
does O
provide O
adequate O
protection O
from O
minor O
bumps O
and O
bangs O
. O

Seems O
like O
a O
small O
issue O

With O
all O
volume O
all O
the O
way O
up O
, O
it O
was O
very O
loud O
- O
hard O
to O
believe O
from O
such O
a O
small O
speaker O
. O

Update O
2/17/2013:This O
laptop O
is O
garbage O
. O

Pretty O
light O
but O
provides O
reasonable O
padding O
for O
the O
interior O
components O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
camera O
inserto O
Huge O
plus O
that O
the O
camera O
insert O
is O
removableo O

When O
I O
travel O
, O
I O
also O
carry O
the O
US O
three O
- O
prong O
to O
two O
- O
prong O
adapter O
for O
my O
computer O
. O

Those O
nitpicks O
that O
I O
mentioned O
above O
are O
what O
you O
're O
likely O
to O
find O
on O
just O
about O
any O
camera O
you O
choose O
so O
they O
should O
n't O
make O
or O
break O
your O
choice O
on O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
pick O
this O
camera O
up O
. O

Hopefully O
this O
one O
will O
last O
as O
long O
as O
my O
VNV O
Tech O
did O
and O
still O
looks O
fine O
, O
just O
is O
nt O
high O
def O
. O

If O
you O
listen O
to O
music O
at O
low O
volume O
or O
sit O
near O
the O
speaker O
, O
this O
sound O
will O
be O
very O
obvious O
( O
and O
possibly O
quite O
annoying O
) O
. O

Pack O
itself O
weighs O
less O
than O
1 O
lbs O
so O
carrying O
load O
is O
completely O
up O
to O
the O
user O
. O

I O
had O
this O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
, O
and O
find O
it O
very O
disappointing O
for O
a O
supposed O
1W O
dongle O
-- O
not O
worth O
the O
$ O
30 O
price O
. O

A O
few O
things O
worth O
noting:- O

works O
great O
for O
my O
14 O
inch O
laptop O
and O
is O
light O
weight O
enough O
to O
still O
be O
comfy O
in O
the O
lap O
. O

I O
do O
medical O
transcription O
and O
these O
do O
help O
with O
clarity O
, O
enough O
so O
my O
employer O
is O
buying O
them O
for O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Vizio O
has O
chosen O
to O
take O
it O
further O
by O
hiding O
the O
windows O
re O
- O
installation O
partition O
on O
a O
hidden O
HD O
as O
well O
as O
with O
proprietary O
obfuscating O
configurations O
, O
and O
omitting O
tools O
other O
manufacturers O
( O
like O
asus O
and O
lenova O
) O
provide O
which O
allow O
you O
to O
make O
images O
and O
produce O
an O
actual O
installation O
disk O
. O

I O
have O
two O
different O
dongles O
and O
this O
one O
works O
the O
best O
because O
I O
can O
be O
using O
a O
Bluetooth O
keyboard O
mouse O
and O
Bluetooth O
headset O
at O
the O
same O
time O
without O
any O
problem O
unlike O
the O
other O
one O
which O
skips O
. O

( O
Amazon O
unwittingly O
relied O
on O
the O
integrity O
of O
the O
scamster O
dealer O
) O

This O
is O
still O
a O
great O
computer O
nontheless O
. O

Yes O
they O
come O
with O
all O
the O
adapters O
but O
still O
! O

Post O
- O
Antec O
, O
the O
MBP O
runs O
at O
130 O
- O
145F O
on O
average O
. O

Pairs O
quickly O
. O

Happy O
that O
its O
solves O
my O
purpose O
.. O

This O
thing O
is O
going O
back O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
be O
sticking O
with O
the O
Adesso O
ADP O
- O
PU21 O
that O
I O
borrowed O
from O
work O
, O
which O
works O
significantly O
better O
for O
me O

If O
you O
do O
intensive O
graphics O
work O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
display O
resolution O
upgrade O
, O
otherwise O
, O
it O
is O
just O
bragging O
rights O
, O
for O
which O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
pay O
extra O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
a O
friend O
or O
family O
member O
. O

When O
it O
works O
, O
it O
's O
great O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
always O
work O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
quality O
for O
the O
cost O
. O

Overall O
, O
great O
product O

I O
mean O
really O
, O
only O
two O
weeks O

I O
have O
not O
yet O
had O
to O
use O
this O
, O
so O
I O
can O
not O
really O
comment O
on O
it O
. O

I O
am O
connecting O
to O
netgear O
wireless O
G O
router O
downstairs O
and O
about O
3 O
rooms O
away O
. O

Work O
quite O
well O
and O
a O
good O
replacement O
for O
the O
original O
Canon O
cap O
. O

From O
frustration O
to O
the O
sublime O
. O

Happy O
I O
've O
come O
across O
this O
product O
. O

I O
intend O
to O
update O
my O
review O
after O
a O
few O
months O
of O
regular O
use O
. O

This O
camera O
is O
quite O
small O
unlike O
the O
photos O
. O

Great O
value O
, O
and O
fast O
shipping O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
a O
good O
length O
and O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Compact O
when O
folded O
, O
a O
snap O
to O
set O
up O
and O
nice O
looking O
to O
boot O
. O

maybe O
it O
is O
a O
pros O
though O
as O
it O
prevents O
too O
mush O
swaying O
of O
the O
bag O
while O
walkingNo O
shoulder O
pads O
to O
lessen O
the O
weight O
on O
the O
shoulderMain O
zipper O
pouch O
. O

Shame O
those O
rubber O
things O
it O
ships O
with O
come O
off O
so O
easily O
. O

I O
can O
walk O
from O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O

to O
the O

with O
no O
disconnection O
ever O
! O

The O
lack O
of O
pockets O
or O
pouches O
attached O
to O
the O
back O
panel O
contribute O
to O
this O
look O
, O
but O
of O
course O
the O
trade O
- O
off O
is O
that O
there O
are O
n't O
a O

of O

this O
product O
to O
see O
TV O
late O
at O
night O
. O

Still O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
as O
Google O
continues O
to O
update O
and O
optimize O
Chrome O
OS O
it O
will O
become O
faster O
. O

Plays O
games O
way O
better O
than O
equivalent O
machines O
with O
corei5 O
and O
no O
dedicated O
graphics O
card O
( O
Intel O
HD O
chips O
stink O

and O
I O
just O
really O
like O
the O
selections O
they O
carry O
. O

There O
are O
some O
wonderful O
keys O
on O
the O
keyboard O
, O
which O
will O
give O
you O
direct O
actions O
on O
the O
tablet O
. O

Lenovo O
laptops O
are O
the O
only O
ones O
we O
buy O
anymore O
. O

1-Inch O
Laptop O
( O
Black O
) O
is O
very O
cool O
too O
, O
but O
also O
too O
expensive O
for O
me O
to O
take O
seriously O
) O
. O

this O
works O
great O

The O
wiggle O
room O
has O
n't O
been O
an O
issue O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
second O
lens O
but O
would O
imagine O
even O
another O
would O
fit O
in O
nice O
. O

( O
The O
fact O
that O
my O
unit O
has O
T O
- O
mobile O
incorporated O
in O
no O
way O
interferes O
with O
Wi O
- O
fi O
usage O
. O

One O
drawback O
as O
mentioned O
: O
do O
n't O
close O
the O
laptop O
with O
the O
speaker O
attached O
or O
it O
flies O
off O
. O

It O
works O
fine O
if O
you O
install O
the O
OS O
separatelly O
because O
it O
was O
sold O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
software O
that O
just O
slows O
down O
the O
computer O
. O

It O
works O
perfect O
on O
my O
wife O
HP O
NX O
6310 O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
want O
to O
use O
my O
Macbook O
as O
a O
desktop O

First O
things O
first O
: O

so O
I O
did O
not O
need O
a O
top O
of O
the O
line O
laptop O
loaded O
with O
bells O
and O
whistles O
and O
lots O
of O
great O
features O
. O

Amazon O
will O
not O
accept O
returns O
after O
60 O
days O
. O

The O
very O
large O
cloth O
is O
definitely O
the O
best O
, O
I O
prefer O
to O
have O
those O
to O
the O
smaller O
ones O
even O
for O
smaller O
eyeglasses.-D O

The O
audio O
took O
a O
lot O
more O
tinkering O
to O
get O
the O
ports O
configured O
correctly O
on O
both O
my O
desktop O
and O
the O
monitor O
( O
which O
needs O
to O
be O
told O
to O
use O
the O
separate O
audio O
port O
) O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
horrible O
to O
look O
at O
. O

You O
'll O
also O
want O
to O
play O
around O
with O
some O
of O
the O
other O
settings O
in O
this O
dialog O
along O
with O
the O
Bamboo O
settings O
to O
get O
things O
working O
better O
. O

Reported O
ON O
bottom O
problems O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
then O
tried O
using O
a O
USB O
ethernet O
adapter O
, O
and O
my O
phone O
instantly O
went O
dead O
. O

It O
works O
very O
decently O
and O
was O
not O
so O
expensive O
. O

Very O
nice O
micro O
case O
but O

I O
attribute O
that O
to O
a O
temperamental O
touchpad O
more O
than O
anything O
elsei O
bought O
the O
protective O
sleeve O
but O
find O
it O
more O
annoying O
and O
do O
n't O
really O
use O
it O
; O
also O
you O
ca O
n't O
put O
anything O
else O
in O
the O
sleeve O
because O
it O
's O
so O
tightadding O
the O
2nd O
SSD O
was O
easier O
than O
I O
thought O
, O
but O
still O
no O
piece O
of O
cake O
. O

but O
with O
thicker O
dividers O
, O
only O
missing O
tripod O
accessory O
and O
some O
pockets O
infront O
. O

Normal O
Day O
Light O

They O
have O
been O
easy O
to O
contact O
and O
did O
not O
put O
me O
on O
hold O
for O
any O
significant O
length O
of O
time O
. O

Good O
luck O
to O
you O
with O
this O
piece O
o O
' O
mess O
. O

Let O
me O
move O
on O
to O
the O
zippers O
. O

plugged O
into O
a O
win7 O
64 O
bit O
machine O
and O
it O
found O
all O
the O
drivers O
from O
windows O
update O
. O

It O
has O
everything O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

So O
anything O
with O
the O
word O
thin O
is O
a O
plus O
to O
my O
aching O
eyes O
. O

Bass O
/ O
SoundOverall O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
good O

It O
constantly O
moves O
cursor O
and O
tabs O
over O
without O
me O
doing O
so O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
silly O
on O
my O
part- O

From O
a O
materials O
and O
construction O
standpoint O
, O
the O
E6 O
is O
solid O
, O
and O
pretty O
close O
to O
indestructible O
. O

These O
are O
not O
the O
most O
assertive O
connectors O
, O
but O
they O
function O
for O
the O
purpose O
they O
were O
designed O
for O
. O

i O
got O
this O
for O
my O
point O
and O
shoot O
camera O
because O
it O
was O
cheap O
. O

The O
included O
CD O
did O
not O
include O
any O
type O
of O
GUI O
for O
pairing O
devices O
, O
I O
had O
to O
do O
this O
through O
windows O
natively O
. O

I O
can O
fit O
the O
Logitech O
jack O
. O

It O
also O
runs O
my O
must O
- O
have O
regular O
windows O
programs O
on O
the O
desktop O
. O

Deficiency O
in O
design O
: O
Windows O
8 O
would O
be O
made O
more O
tolerable O
if O
the O
screen O
folded O
all O
the O
way O
back O
so O
the O
laptop O
could O
function O
as O
a O
tablet O
. O

They O
're O
sturdy O
, O
well O
- O
made O
, O
and O
keep O
our O
laptops O
well O
protected O
. O

I O
use O
this O
with O
my O
Xbox O
and O
it O
is O
so O
much O
better O
when O
there O
is O
no O
wires O
. O

The O
item O
itself O
does O
exactly O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
... O
and O
that O
's O
really O
it O
. O

so O
if O
you O
are O
thinking O
to O
buy O
this O
little O
dongle O
to O
use O
it O
on O
you O
windows O
8 O
let O

and O
I O
use O
it O
with O
my O
D10 O
underwater O
camera O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
from O
amazon O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
anyone O
that O
needs O
a O
replacement O
battery O
for O
their O
dell O
laptop O
computer O
. O

The O
slightest O
touchand O
it O
's O
off O
and O
running O
. O

This O
sleeve O
fits O
nicely O
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
such O
a O
strong O
chemical O
smell O
to O
it O
, O
that O
I O
had O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
, O
because O
the O
smell O
just O
would O
n't O
go O
away O
. O

MS O
likely O
will O
fix O
this O
with O
Windows O
8 O
. O

However O
, O
the O
typing O
on O
this O
keyboard O
is O
like O
typing O
on O
concrete O
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
does O
what O
it O
says O
it O
will O
do O
. O

This O
repeats O
itself O
again O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

I O
will O
look O
into O
purchasing O
a O
Intel O
6300 O
later O
on O
& O
will O
update O
this O
review O
accordingly O
with O
the O
results O
of O
using O
a O
high O
end O
Intel O
card O
over O
the O
Bigfoot O
Killer O
N-1103 O
. O

Instead O
, O
thecover O
material O
is O
a O
very O
cool O
, O
shimmery O
metallic O
linen O
. O

Why O
is O
this O
my O
third O
one O
? O

I O
understand O
it O
is O
by O
design O
. O

That O
was O
n't O
the O
case O
as O
I O
spent O
the O
next O
hour O
trying O
to O
switch O
the O
device O
on O
and O
pair O
it O
up O
only O
to O
have O
it O
shut O
off O
again O
after O
about O
20 O
seconds O
, O
at O
most O
. O

, O
It O
works O
great O
with O
my O
Helix O
docked O
with O
the O
keyboard O
and O
without O
. O

I O
use O
mine O
with O
older O
iphone O
3s O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
work O
any O
better O
than O
the O
original O
factory O
battery O
that O
only O
held O
a O
charge O
for O
2 O
hours O
or O
so O
. O

Includes O
1 O
year O
of O
crash O
damage O
warranty O
( O
from O
ASUS)- O

You O
click O
on O
anything O
( O
audio O
, O
video O
) O
and O

Thanks O
AMAZON O
, O
you O
did O
it O
again O
with O
quality O
products O
like O
this O
. O

I O
will O
come O
back O
to O
update O
if O
this O
happens O
again O
. O

It O
has O
a O
long O
, O
but O
thin O
cord O
. O

The O
card O
( O
memory O
stick O
pro O
duo O
) O
can O
easily O
be O
wiggled O
in O
the O
slot O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
anything O
bulky O
, O
though O
- O
something O
that O
fits O
in O
my O
purse O
or O
small O
backpack O
, O
sounds O
good O
, O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
are O
all O
requirements O
. O

Wishlist O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
bag O
had O
a O
tripod O
holder O
and O
a O
water O
bottle O
holder O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Excellent O
in O
all O
respects O
. O

If O
you O
are O
careful O
with O
it O
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
. O

I O
most O
especially O
love O
the O
backlit O
keyboard O
becuz O
I O
am O
a O
nite O
owl O
, O
I O
like O
to O
type O
in O
the O
dark O
and O
this O
is O
just O
great O
for O
me O
. O

I O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
this O
laptop O
is O
last O
year O
's O
model O
, O
because O
it O
was O
way O
behind O
on O
firmware O
/ O
bios O
updates O
, O
Windows O
updates O
, O
etc O
. O

Even O
though O
Windows O
7 O
is O
the O
biggest O
software O
product O
of O
all O
time O
, O
once O
you O
install O
Windows O
8 O
, O
there O
's O
no O
going O
back O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
run O
Visio O
2013 O
, O
but O
ultimately O
had O
to O
revert O
back O
to O
a O
Windows O
XP O
VM O
with O
Visio O
2010 O
. O

That O
is O
my O
recommendation O
to O
anyone O
reading O
this O
review O
. O

NO O
LONGER O
CHARGES O
BATTERY O
after O
less O
than O
TWO O
months!!!. O
Immediately O
compatible O
with O
Dell O
Inspiron O
E1705 O
. O

My O
LCD O
looked O
like O
a O
water O
down O
version O
of O
what O
I O
was O
seeing O
on O
QNIX O
. O

This O
is O
, O
without O
a O
doubt O
, O
a O
very O
important O
point O
. O

Innergie O
sounds O
like O
a O
company O
interested O
in O
making O
us O
happy O
with O
their O
power O
supply O
items O
and O
I O
commend O
them O
for O
doing O
so O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
build O
quality O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
add O
a O
sub O
you O
should O
look O
at O
theLogitech O

but O
when O
you O
put O
it O
into O
the O
laptop O
it O
looks O
beautifully O
black O
. O

Aside O
from O
a O
different O
appearance O
, O
which O
of O
course O
does O
n't O
matter O
, O
it O
works O
as O
it O
should O
. O

But O
, O
so O
cheap O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
product O
even O
if O
it O
only O
runs O
6 O
months O
MTBF O
. O

Samsung O
's O
recovery O
told O
me O
to O
hold O
volume O
up O
and O
then O
power O
in O
order O
to O
get O
into O
recovery O
mode O
. O

As O
of O
the O
date O
of O
this O
review O
, O
Disneyland O
does O
n't O
offer O
free O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
while O
you O
're O
waiting O
in O
line O
for O
a O
ride O
or O
for O
a O
parade O
. O

I O
think O
originally O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
hours O
out O
of O
the O
thing O
with O
a O
fairly O
intense O
workload O
. O

, O
it O
pulls O
all O
of O
the O
appropriate O
drivers O
and O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

The O
blue O
LED O
lights O
are O
pleasant O
to O
the O
eye O
without O
being O
distracting O
and O
are O
constant O
, O
not O
flashing O
with O
the O
sound O
. O

Surprisingly O
enough O
It O
comes O
with O
win O
office O
, O
albeit O
, O
an O
older O
version O
, O
but O
it O
works O
. O

Great O
PC O
on O
paper O
and O
hp O
definitely O
has O
a O
winning O
combination O
here O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
save O
your O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
will O
keep O
it O
from O
small O
scratches O
and O
dings O
while O
its O
being O
transported O
. O

, O
I O
would O
strongly O
suggest O
buying O
a O
few O
. O

It O
is O
very O
thought O
less O
product O
. O

Great O
camera O
bag O
for O
this O
price O
. O

Just O
something O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
when O
deciding O
to O
purchase O
this O
battery O
as O
a O
spare O
because O
$ O
110 O
is O
not O
a O
small O
chunk O
of O
change O
. O

This O
one O
was O
much O
less O
than O
it O

I O
did O
not O
return O
the O
item O
because O
as O
useless O
as O
the O
cable O
is O
it O
is O
more O
expensive O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
back O
than O
to O
get O
the O
refund O
. O

I O
originally O
picked O
up O
the O
newer O
[ O
basic O
] O
840 O
model O
from O
recommendation O
at O
MicroCenter O
, O
but O
after O
some O
research O
decided O
to O
go O
with O
this O
tried O
, O
tested O
, O
and O
true O
830 O
offering O
. O

I O
like O
this O
so O
much O
that O
in O
the O
spring O
time O
I O
just O
might O
have O
to O
change O
my O
Chromebook O
's O
& O
# O
34;outfit&#34 O
; O
to O
a O
nice O
spring O
color O
! O

No O
issues O
at O
all O
in O
hooking O
it O
up O
between O
a O
rMBP O
and O
also O
a O
MBA O
to O
multiple O
24 O
' O
Dell O
and O
HP O
monitors O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
have O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
original O
power O
supply O
to O
a O
Dell O
Latitude O
D620 O
( O
the O
power O
cable O
on O
the O
original O
is O
starting O
to O
fray O
near O
the O
coax O
jack O
going O
into O
the O
PC O
) O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
a O
Bluetooth O
remote O
control O
app O
with O
my O
Android O
phone O
. O

I O
suspect O
a O
Class O
Action O
Lawsuit O
may O
be O
needed O
if O
Apple O
wo O
nt O
take O
care O
of O
their O
customers O

The O
little O
flanges O
on O
the O
earbuds O
tend O
to O
accumulate O
gunk O
, O
but O
are O
easy O
to O
clean O
. O

All O
I O
have O
left O
to O
do O
now O
is O
add O
another O
2 O
G O
of O
RAM O
, O
and O
put O
Windows O
7 O
on O
it O
, O
and O
it O
'll O
beat O
any O
of O
those O
garbage O
Windows8 O
laptops O
available O
in O
stores O
right O
now O
:P O

Machine O
shut O
down O
and O
could O
not O
repair O
itself O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
good O
deal O
especially O
with O
the O
20 O
$ O
rebate O
. O

Its O
small O
, O
easy O
to O
carry O
, O
and O
goes O
through O
airport O
security O
quicker O
than O
I O
can O
get O
through O
the O
metal O
detector O
. O

More O
scratch O
resistance O
of O
the O
actual O
case O
itself O
. O

Either O
do O
n't O
buy O
one O
, O
or O
pray O
your O
battery O
lasts O
forever O
. O

Not O
a O
big O
con O
. O

So O
why O
not O
have O
two O
sets O
-- O
if O
you O
have O
to O
take O
your O
computer O
home O
and O
do O
your O
work O
and O
then O
back O
to O
work-- O
keep O
it O
simple O
that O
's O
my O
dealio O
! O
! O

First O
thing O
I O
did O
after O
installing O
the O
ram O
was O
run O
apple O
hardware O
test O
to O
ensure O
the O
ram O
was O
good O
. O

Let O
me O
just O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
only O
read O
one O
review O
... O
all O
I O
needed O
to O
see O
were O
the O
number O
of O
reviews O
and O
the O
average O
number O
of O
stars O
I O
saw O
with O
it O
( O
4 O
. O

what O
ever O
your O
configuration O
is O
. O

It O
does O
the O
job O
well O

Then O
games O
configured O
to O
run O
with O
the O
540 O
M O
will O
do O
so O
. O

Both O
worked O
well O
together O
. O

The O
telescopic O
handle O
is O
pretty O
unsteady O
, O
and O
some O
of O
its O
screws O
on O
top O
are O
coming O
loose O
easily O

The O
only O
complaint O
I O
have O
about O
this O
product O
. O

it O
works O
fine O
, O
no O
problems O
. O

The O
Tab O
works O
well O
as O
a O
hot O
spot O
, O
and O
is O
very O
slick O
toggling O
between O
Wifi O
and O
3 O
G O
with O
the O
latest O
upgrade O
. O

I O
gave O
this O
4 O
stars O
versus O
5 O
because O
it O
was O
n't O
free O
. O

Buy O
the O
U810 O
knowing O
that O
you O
will O
be O
learning O
a O
new O
( O
but O
easily O
adapted O
) O
way O
to O
type O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
my O
mom O

Lost O
my O
last O
one O
, O
bought O
one O
here O
as O
a O
replacement O
. O

My O
wireless O
router O
recently O
broke O
and O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
conveniently O
use O
the O
Chromebook O
without O
going O
to O
a O
coffee O
shop O
. O

They O
are O
small O
and O
lightRequire O
no O
external O
powerWork O
well O
in O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
lighting O
conditionsCost O
very O
little O
compared O
to O
traditional O
camerasCan O
be O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
traditional O
cameras O
for O
your O
in O
- O

, O
YouTube O
or O
Live O
Streaming O

for O
yourself O
. O

Since O
2003 O
they O
have O
delivered O
on O
their O
near O
6 O
hour O
promise O
as O
I O
usually O
get O
around O
5 O
. O

the O
notebook O
that O
I O
newly O
got O
( O
a O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
5105-S701 O
) O
gets O
hot O
pretty O
fast O
at O
the O
bottom O
that O
I O
wonder O
that O
I O
can O
boil O
water O
with O
such O
heat O
. O

The O
basic O
claim O
is O
that O
you O
can O
access O
this O
drive O
via O
the O
internet O
, O
but O
they O
fail O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
you O
need O
to O
purchase O
this O
application O
( O
MIONET O
) O
. O

I O
actually O
have O
n't O
checked O
it O
yet O
) O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
I O
've O
been O
pretty O
impressed O
with O
this O
Case O
Logic O
bag O
. O

It O
literally O
just O
arrived O
in O
the O
mail O
and O
i O
already O
have O
it O
on O
. O

Most O
homes O
users O
will O
be O
fine O
with O
Win O
7 O
Premium O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
old O
software O
you O
may O
consider O
getting O
a O
notebook O
with O
Win O
7 O
Pro O
( O
which O
will O
add O
a O
little O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
notebook).Optical O
Drive O
: O

Or O
buy O
a O
programmable O
remote O
and O
spend O
two O
days O
setting O
it O
up O
to O
run O
all O
my O
devices O
and O
teach O
it O
to O
change O
video O

I O

The O
most O
annoying O
thing O
is O
not O
having O
the O

My O

I O
ca O
n't O
compare O
it O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
could O
be O
any O
happier O
with O
anything O
else O
. O

Unlike O
the O
European O

the O

not O

for O

. O

I O
'm O
not O
doing O
any O
major O

so O
I O
can O
not O
comment O
on O

. O

The O
Kindle O
is O
more O
loosely O
held O
in O
this O
case O
than O
my O
other O
; O
it O
seems O
to O
slip O
around O
a O
bit O
more O
( O
in O
the O
more O
rigid O
corner O

) O
than O
in O
my O

with O

I O
am O
still O
getting O

the O

If O
you O
want O
a O
decent O

, O
this O
is O
it O

This O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
, O
for O
a O
low O

There O
was O
absolutely O
no O

, O
this O

much O
better O

The O
benefits O
of O

outweigh O
the O
benefits O
of O

GOOD O
BOTHGuess O

That O
aside O
, O
this O
is O
a O
high O
quality O
backpack O
for O
all O
your O
electronic O
gear O
. O

this O
was O
a O
replacement O
and O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
more O
money O
will O
get O
you O
a O
better O
camera O
, O
but O
this O
is O
an O
awesome O
balance O
of O
quality O
, O
value O
, O
and O
versatility O
for O
any O

and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
trouble O
with O
it O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O

Then O
I O
started O
coiling O
the O
cord O
and O
putting O
it O
flat O
in O
my O
computer O

was O

I O
finally O
had O
to O
burn O
it O
onto O
a O
regular O
size O
CD O
on O
another O
conputer O
to O
use O
it O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
absolutely O
amazing O
sound O
this O
small O
system O
produces O
, O
I O
can O
forgive O
this O
small O
lapse O
. O

My O
airport O
card O
in O
my O
mac O
died O
so O
I O
got O
this O
as O
a O
cheap O
alternative O
. O

Crapped O
out O
on O
me O
after O
about O
a O
year O
. O

I O
chose O
these O
in O
order O
to O
know O
where O
my O
cables O
where O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
different O
wooden O
pieces O
of O
furniture O
. O

I O
picked O
up O
my O
Macbook O
to O
move O
it O
, O
and O
found O
the O
metal O
plate O
covering O
the O
battery O
packs O
was O
just O
laying O
there O
. O

With O
the O
number O
of O
places O
to O
put O
things O
in O
various O
pockets O
and O

, O
one O
challenge O
is O
to O
remember O
where O
you O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
put O
something O
in O
the O
past O
so O
you O
can O
find O
it O
again O

I O
could O

ask O
for O

13 O
- O
13:I O
ended O
up O
connecting O
this O
to O
the O
stereo O
in O
the O
living O
room O
instead O
of O
to O
a O
set O
of O
speakers O
in O
the O
bedroom O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
excellent O
and O
rivals O
full O
sized O
stereo O
systems O
. O

Plugged O
in O
, O
set O
up O
& O
away O
she O
went O
. O

This O
version O
, O
designed O
to O
run O
Linux O
, O
does O
not O
. O

The O
video O
image O
was O
horrible O
, O
dark O
and O
grainy O
even O
when O
using O
the O
LED O
lights O
. O

So O
, O
cold O
boot O
works O
great O
. O

all O
my O
devices O
are O
connected O
without O
any O
problems O
, O
its O
really O
nice O
, O
portable O
( O
light O
) O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
its O
slides O
out O
of O
the O
base O
, O
very O
affordable O
and O
got O
here O
in O
one O
piece O
. O

So O
far O
, O
it O
's O
working O
as O
expected O
. O

Hard O
to O
believe O
how O
cool O
this O
little O
thing O
is O
I O
love O
it O
.. O

I O
like O
having O
outside O
pockets O
. O

But O
this O
one O
just O
did O
n't O
make O
the O
cut O
. O

I O
will O
say O
that O
this O
notebook O
is O
n't O
for O
everyone O
. O

This O
cooling O
pad O
was O
okay O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
made O
out O
of O
cheap O
materials O
, O
though O
. O

Switch O
to O
a O
different O
brand O
of O
card O
, O
same O
WAP O
, O
same O
VPN O
configuration O
, O
same O
laptop O
-- O
and O
things O
are O
fine O
. O

After O
iTunes O
this O
feels O
almost O
like O
cheating O
it O
is O
so O
easy O
. O

This O
product O
works O
with O
minor O
glitches O
. O

IT O
IS O
RIGHT O
SMACK O
IN O
THE O
CENTER O

Now O
I O
just O
need O
to O
select O
one O
of O
my O
pens O
in O
the O
desktop O
software O
and O
I O
can O
see O
all O
the O
notebooks O
for O
that O
pen O
. O

but O
it O
's O
well O
built O
and O
stylish O
looking O
. O

My O
review O
is O
based O
solely O
on O
that O
model O
. O

Really O
like O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
am O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
finding O
some O
kind O
of O
replacement O
for O
them O
-- O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
my O
laptop O
will O
slip O
off O
of O
a O
desk O
if O
it O
is O
jarred O
or O
someone O
knocks O
into O
me O
because O
my O
laptop O
has O
absolutely O
NO O
traction O
now O
. O

" O
yes O
speakerS O
, O
it O
is O
just O
one O
. O

Within O
just O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
of O
comparing O
the O
V450 O
with O
a O
Microsoft O
3000 O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
3000 O
simply O
feels O
more O
natural O
, O
more O
substantial O
, O
and O
more O
supportive O
in O
my O
large O
paw O
than O
the O
V450 O
. O

I O
m O
totally O
happy O
.. O

While O
I O
'd O
stop O
short O
of O
saying O
it O
can O
do O
" O
anything O
" O
, O
as O
long O
as O
you O
're O
not O
looking O
to O
watch O
high O
- O
definition O
video O
or O
play O
high O
- O
end O
3D O
games O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
do O
what O
you O
want O
it O
to O
do O
. O

Immediately O
when O
I O
received O
this O
cable O
I O
noted O
that O
the O
connections O
were O
reinforced O
better O
, O
the O
shielding O
of O
the O
cable O
was O
more O
robust O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
connectors O
themselves O
was O
better O
. O

8 O
sata O
plugs O

on O
two O
lines O
. O

After O
installing O
the O
freeware O
in O
the O
system O
start O
tray O
, O
the O
background O
noise O
was O
greatly O
reduced O
and O
is O
now O
OK O
. O

These O
netbooks O
are O
made O
to O
be O
cheap O
and O
short O
lived O
. O

Also O
, O
as O
another O
reviewer O
noted O
, O
the O
speaker O
does O
have O
a O
tendency O
to O
vibrate O
itself O
out O
of O
position O
if O
played O
at O
high O
volume O
with O
bass O
. O

If O
you O
plan O
to O
carry O
an O
ultra O
portable O
or O
netbook O
with O
an O
11 O
. O
6 O
" O
screen O
and O
carry O
the O
AC O
adapter O
with O
it O
, O
this O
wo O
n't O
work O
for O
you O
. O

A O
handy O
size O
, O
reasonable O
price O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
snyc O
with O
all O
my O
devices O
. O

I O
ordered O
it O
for O
my O
second O
work O
monitor O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Creative O
T40 O
's O
had O
the O
bass O
and O
treble O
controls O
and O
no O
big O
brick O
transformer O
unit O
to O
power O
them O
. O

When O
it O
first O
started O
playing O
music O
I O
just O
sat O
there O
with O
it O
in O
the O
palm O
of O
my O
hand O
, O
marveling O
at O
the O
technology O
that O
produces O
so O
much O
sound O
from O
this O
cute O
little O
gadget O
. O

Unboxing O
: O
Box O
opening O
, O
and O
product O
layout O
was O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
. O

I O
like O
it O
, O
but O
the O
flash O
card O
does O
n't O
slide O
in O
easily O
. O

at O
+ O
$ O
400 O
price O
rage O
, O
I O
'd O
advise O
looking O
into O
14 O
" O
notebooks O
options O
listed O
below O
, O
to O
get O
more O
for O
your O
money O
. O

ft O
length O
limits O
the O
distance O
to O
a O
stationary O
object O
under O
a O
desk O
to O
wrap O
the O
cable O
around O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
them O
on O
cloth O
as O
name O
tags O
and O
on O
plastic O
as O
labels O
and O
they O
stick O
well O
, O
even O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

The O
build O
and O
sound O
have O
a O
solid O
feel O
you O
definitely O
do O
n't O
find O
in O
those O
$ O
20 O
speakers O
. O

This O
is O
a O
second O
/ O
backup O
computer O
for O
us O
, O
and O
has O
the O
ideal O
price O
and O
capabilities O
for O
that O
, O
plus O
featured O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
first O
computer O
if O
the O
other O
one O
goes O
out O
. O

Apparently O
one O
of O
my O
daughters O
tried O
to O
insert O
a O
flashdrive O
into O
one O
of O
the O
USB O
ports O
upside O
down O
( O
like O
all O
of O
us O
have O
many O
times O
before O
) O
. O

Good O
item O
, O
depending O
on O
where O
your O
USB O
ports O
are O
it O
can O
get O
in O
the O
way O
of O
your O
screen O
. O

But O
I O
personally O
like O
the O
blue O
backlight O
on O
the O
keyboard O

Then O
the O
next O
day O
I O
got O
home O
and O
my O
power O
had O
gone O
out O
, O
so O
when O
I O
turned O
all O
of O
the O
computers O
back O
on O
once O
again O
I O
had O
Internet O
on O
all O
of O
them O
, O
but O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
see O
each O
other O
on O
the O
network O
. O

Low O
level O
formatting O
of O
the O
card O
allowed O
for O
very O
acceptable O
rapid O
- O
fire O
sequential O
still O
photo O
shooting O
speeds O
when O
light O
levels O
were O
bright O
enough O
that O
the O
flash O
was O
not O
needed O
/ O
used O
. O

The O
straps O
are O
thick O
and O
comfy O
, O
though O
they O
can O
feel O
a O
little O
like O
they O
're O
going O
to O
slide O
off O
your O
arms O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
them O
cinched O
a O
little O
in O
toward O
your O
shoulders O
. O

First O
time O
vie O
used O
a O
device O
like O
this O
, O
but O
let O
me O
say O
- O
the O
install O
( O
Windows O
Vista O
32 O
bit O
) O
was O
super O
simple O
, O
just O
plugged O
the O
little O
base O
station O
into O
the O
PC O
's O
USB O
port O
, O
plugged O
the O
Adapter O
in O
the O
base O
, O

It O
could O
have O
a O
touch O
more O
padding O

Highly O
recommend O
! O

The O
touch O
sensitive O
volume O
controls O
and O
mute O
button O
are O
right O
next O
to O
the O
One O
Key O
Theater O
Button O
, O
and O
there O
is O
also O
an O
on O
- O
screen O
display O
that O
pops O
up O
when O
you O
touch O
one O
of O
these O
buttons O
, O
similar O
to O
what O
you O
would O
see O
on O
your O
television O
. O

USB O
cable O
seems O
to O
fit O
snugly O
. O

The O
blacks O
are O
deep O
and O
dark O
the O
XBox O
360 O
games O
are O
incredible O
on O
this O
unit O
. O

-The O
mouse O
has O
just O
one O
button O
- O
umm O
..... O

The O
stutter O
in O
the O
voice O
( O
which O
some O
other O
reviews O
go O
on O
and O
on O
about O
) O
is O
silly O
but O
not O
that O
annoying O
. O

I O
also O
use O
it O
on O
my O
desk O
and O
find O
the O
adjustable O
angle O
makes O
the O
laptop O
more O
comfortable O
. O

The O
XPad O
is O
far O
more O
unobtrusive O
than O
the O
products O
you O
'll O
find O
at O
most O
office O
supply O
or O
department O
stores O
for O
laptop O
cooling O
, O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
trade O
mine O
for O
any O
other O
product O
. O

it O
was O
5 O
years O
old O
though O
, O
so O
time O
to O
upgrade O
anyways."DON'T O

After O
all O
as O
I O
mentioned O
if O
Asus O
comes O
with O
a O
good O
price O
tag O
maybe O
I O
will O
re O
consider O
it O

There O
is O
some O
issue O
which O
Sonic O
Impact O
failed O
to O
notice.[- O
] O

The O
quiet O
keyboard O
also O
feels O
nice O
and O
the O
touchpad O
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

Multi O
- O
tasking O
: O
Easily O
work O
with O
2 O
- O
3 O
programs O
. O

Very O
light O
, O
stylish O
, O
and O
powers O
up O
quickly O
. O

This O
item O
showed O
up O
FAST O
for O
us O
! O

So O
, O
after O
contacting O
their O
support O
, O
they O
have O
notified O
me O
that O
several O
customers O
have O
had O
my O
issue O
and O
offered O
the O
following O
fix O
: O

I O
used O
to O
store O
my O
digital O
camera O
and O
other O
big O
items O
in O
those O
side O
pockets O
. O

This O
Medialink O
bluetooth O
antenna O
is O
very O
userfriendly O
and O
intuitive O
to O
use O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
laptop O
, O
do O
n't O
keep O
the O
battery O
in O
the O
laptop O
. O

They O
are O
great O
for O
laptop O
use O
and O
are O
rather O
compact O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
return O
this O
unit O
and O
see O
if O
my O
next O
one O
yield O
the O
same O
results O
and O
I O
will O
update O
once O
I O
do O
, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
from O
prior O
reviews O
, O
its O
just O
the O
adapter O
has O
A O
) O
incompatability O
with O
certain O
tvs O
to O
yield O
power O
to O
power O
the O
adapter O
and O
the O
monitor O
at O
the O
same O
timee O
. O

Why O
it O
did O
n't O
occur O
to O
me O
that O
it O
was O
my O
new O
computer O
, O
I O
wil O
never O
know O
. O

It O
has O
tons O
of O
pockets O
, O
well O
thought O
out O
design O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
item O
to O
connect O
my O
creative O
wireless O
D80 O
via O
Bluetooth O
, O
it O
seem O
to O
work O
just O
fine O
for O
now O
. O

it O
get O
stuck O
on O
the O
charger O
. O

wow O
its O
just O
fantastic O
, O
it O
works O
great O
! O
! O
! O
! O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
usb O
powered O
lamp O
, O
check O
this O
one O
out O
5 O

The O
upgrade O
will O
try O
to O
corner O
you O
into O
creating O
a O
Windows O
cloud O
account O
in O
order O
to O
login O
to O
your O
computer O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
take O
my O
video O
card O
out O
of O
my O
old O
Dell O
and O
put O
it O
in O
this O
one O
. O

and O
then O
I O
had O
to O
get O
out O
the O
windex O
. O

This O
amp O
now O
boosts O
up O
the O
volume O
and O
is O
perfect O
! O

The O
key O
is O
to O
configure O
it O
for O
the O
setting O
you O
are O
in O
. O

so O
he O
simply O
opened O
the O
package O
and O
checked O
the O
contents O
with O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
where O
no O
damages O
to O
the O
set O
. O

because O
it O
is O
so O
balky O
, O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
using O
it O
after O
a O
while O
because O
the O
benefit O
of O
organizing O
a O
few O
items O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
bulk O
and O
extra O
weight O
. O

Nice O
way O
to O
keep O
me O
going O
. O

After O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
I O
built O
up O
my O
speed O
. O

I O
'm O
comparing O
these O
two O
monitors O
to O
an O
HP O
w2207 O
, O
a O
relatively O
expensive O
monitor O
i O
purchased O
two O
years O
ago O
. O

Since O
most O
displays O
come O
with O
both O
analog O
and O
digital O
cables O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
solution O
to O
support O
two O
external O
displays O
if O
your O
laptop O
has O
a O
DisplayPort O
( O
instead O
of O
HDMI O
) O
. O

It O
has O
the O
same O
resolution O
as O
my O
Sony O
, O
but O
I O
can O
clearly O
see O
the O
grid O
lines O
between O
the O
pixels O
. O

The O
Acer O
access O
was O
consistently O
10 O
Mbps O
and O
I O
tried O
everything O
in O
software O
to O
up O
the O
speed O
with O
no O
luck O
. O

I O
shopped O
around O
and O
tried O
several O
different O
coolers O
/ O
pads O
. O

IT O
would O
be O
nice O
that O
you O
could O
choose O
which O
programs O
or O
apps O
should O
be O
given O
the O
priority O
setting O
of O
using O
the O
highest O
processor O
speed O
. O

I O
am O
much O
happier O
. O

so O
I O
could O
give O
a O
full O
and O
accurate O
review O
of O
my O
experiences O
. O

I O
always O
loved O
IBM O
/ O
Lenovo O
products O
because O
they O
make O
solid O
and O
reliable O
computers O
. O

With O
this O
cord O
( O
which O
is O
the O
perfect O
length O
to O
attach O
to O
my O
TV O
and O
keep O
the O
laptop O
within O
reach O
) O
I O
am O
able O
to O
hookup O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
and O
stream O
anything O
on O
my O
TV O
that O
I O
can O
stream O
on O
my O
computer O
. O

Toshiba O
KIRA O
i7 O
is O
a O
sleek O
, O
fast O
, O
and O
light O
computer O
that O
is O
aesthetically O
beautiful O
but O
has O
a O
powerful O
operating O
system O
. O

It O
is O
thin O
and O
the O
screen O
size O
it O
perfect O
not O
too O
big O
but O
not O
too O
small O
. O

I O
use O
a O
laptop O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
. O

It O
works O
quickly O
and O
setup O
was O
no O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

There O
's O
no O
cord O
, O
making O
it O
more O
compact O
, O
and O
the O
plug O
swivels O
so O
you O
can O
position O
the O
unit O
up O
, O
down O
, O
or O
sideways O
. O

The O
product O
description O
is O
inaccurate O
because O
the O
poor O
reception O
is O
not O
acceptable O
. O

Worked O
like O
a O
champ O
- O
customer O
is O

But O
they O
only O
worked O
about O
half O
the O
time O
. O

Looking O
forward O
to O
taking O
it O
on O
a O
trip O
in O
lieu O
of O
my O
old O
Palm O
Pilot O
or O
buying O
a O
big O
, O
heavy O
laptop O
. O

Its O
clumsy O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
it O
keeps O
the O
laptop O
charging O
for O
a O
decent O
price O
, O
plus O
gives O
you O
6 O
more O
USB O
ports O
and O
other O
media O
inputs O
. O

All O
is O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
two O
, O
but O
then O
bulbs O
start O
to O
flicker O
and O
die O
. O

I O
read O
a O
few O
reviews O
and O
they O
were O
saying O
that O
this O
is O
a O
professional O
camera O
. O

If O
you O
scroll O
over O
them O
they O
say O
HF O
200 O
terrible O
camera O
? O

I O
purchased O
this O
card O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
concern O
after O
having O
read O
reviews O
indicating O
that O
it O
fit O
too O
tightly O
and O
that O
removing O
it O
might O
be O
an O
issue O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
multi O
port O
hub O
to O
remedy O
that O
. O

I O
tried O
checking O
the O
write O
- O
protect O
tab O
, O
reinserting O
it O
, O
and O
using O
a O
different O
computer O
. O

Now O
I O
feel O
better O
about O
the O
protection O
of O
my O
macbook O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
dog O
jumped O
on O
it O
this O
morning O
. O

UPDATE!!Its O
been O
a O
little O
over O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
since O
I O
purchased O
this O
product O
and O
it O
has O
held O
up O
well O
. O

the O
grip O
support O
makes O
it O
feel O
really O
solid O
, O
there O
are O
teflon O
pads O
underneath O
which O
let O
it O
glide O
even O
on O
an O
unpolished O
wood O
desk O
, O
and O
the O
buttons O
have O
a O
satisfying O
click O
to O
them O
. O

Decent O
try O
but O
by O
no O
means O
great O
. O

I O
needed O
the O
connector O
to O
complete O
the O
insulation O
of O
my O
speaker O
system O
so O
if O
I O
needed O
to O
move O
the O
receiver O
I O
could O
easily O
disconnect O
the O
wire O
and O
move O
it O
. O

I O
've O
found O
that O
most O
of O
the O
USB O
adapters O
do O
better O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
use O
their O
software O
, O
let O
Windows O
have O
control O
. O

It O
fits O
perfectly O

got O
my O
Prime O

after O
preordering O

Dec. O

and O
i O
must O
say O
its O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

That O
's O
what O
prompted O
me O
to O
notice O
the O
make O
of O
the O
product O
. O

cools O
better O
than O
the O
double O
fan O
any O
way O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
the O
original O
software O
on O
the O
thing O
added O
/ O
subtracted O
to O
it O
's O
performance O
. O

I O
am O
guessing O
that O
the O
USB O
power O
draw O
from O
the O
Kinamax O
cooling O
pad O
caused O
temps O
to O
increase O
, O
a O

a O
lot O
of O

and O
this O
battery O
holds O
it O

own O
. O

It O
was O
cheap O
and O
it O
works O
, O
just O
what O
you O
want O
. O

6 O
variant O
of O
this O
case O
for O
my O
Asus O
t100 O
tablet O
and O
its O
attached O
keyboard O
. O

Not O
the O
case O
with O
the O
2 O
. O
4 O
Ghz O
MBP O
with O
2 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
it O
with O
two O
different O
cell O
phones O
and O
it O
works O
much O
better O
with O
one O
than O
the O
other O
. O

Anyway O
, O
my O
final O
thought O
about O
this O
ultrabook O
is O
that O
this O
is O
a O
decent O
ultrabook O
and O
pretty O
good O
one O
for O
the O
pricing O
. O

I O
took O
the O
headphones O
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
was O
immediately O
impressed O
with O
the O
build O
quality O
and O
overall O
style O
. O

It O
does O
a O
great O
job O
keeping O
my O
lenovo O
y550 O
cooler O
and O
my O
keeping O
my O
lap O
cooler O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
this O
Acer O

The O
only O
caveat O
is O
that O
I O
see O
inconsistent O
performance O
with O
my O
Windows O
8 O
. O

The O
charger O
cable O
took O
about O
3 O
days O
to O
arrive O
& O
when O
it O
did O
, O
I O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
test O
it O
out O
. O

The O
product O
arrived O
here O
quickly O
, O
and O
was O
a O
simple O
plug O
and O
play O
. O

Everything O
runs O
smoothly O
and O
quickly O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
quality O
knockoff O
especially O
considering O
the O
fact O
that O
Apple O
has O
decided O
to O
torture O
its O
customers O
by O
having O
to O
buy O
a O
thousand O
connectors O
for O
the O
new O
versions O
of O
its O
gadgets O
! O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
tight O
for O
a O
10 O
" O
netbook O
with O
all O
the O
accessories O
, O
but O
perfect O
for O
travel O
without O
the O
cords O
. O

Once O
I O
opened O
the O
package O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
item O
was O
bent O
at O
one O
of O
the O
corners O
. O

Choose O
to O
save O
certain O
messages O
and O
attachments O
locally O
, O
etc O
. O
that O
I O
may O
need O
later O
or O
offline O
. O

I O
'm O
wearing O
shorts O
. O

If O
you O
're O
using O
a O
mouse O
with O
a O
trackpad O
or O
ergonomic O
mouse O
with O
a O
trackball O
, O
that O
'll O
also O
fit O
fine O
. O

But O
it O
works O
for O
now O
until O
I O
get O
an O
external O
flash O
and O
then O
no O
problem O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
still O
standing O
up O
to O
carrying O
both O
laptops O
approximately O
3 O
times O
per O
week O
with O
no O
signs O
of O
failure O
. O

I O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
I O
am O
going O
to O
be O
elsewhere O
for O
any O
extended O
period O
. O

Thank O
you O
Amazon O
for O
bringing O
this O
to O
me O
for O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O

I O
find O
Windows O
8 O
is O
better O
suited O
for O
tablets O
and O
phones O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
product O
and O
recommended O
it O
strongly O
. O

They O
even O
called O
me O
back O
a O
few O
days O
later O
to O
make O
sure O
everything O
was O
going O
O. O
K O
.. O

There O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
fabric O
so O
that O
these O
full O
length O
compartments O
can O
take O
something O
a O
bit O
thicker O
than O
a O
magazine O
such O
a O
light O
windbreaker O
or O
even O
a O
book O
. O

I O
think O
mac O
has O
greatly O
improved O
their O
OS O
since O
the O
90s O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
NotePal O
laptop O
cooling O
device O
that O
I O
have O
bought O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
case O

This O
one O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

That O
said O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
know O
the O
dimensions O
before O
buying O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
buy O
it O
as O
flash O
memory O
for O
my O
computer O
, O
however O
. O

I O
had O
no O
problem O
typing O
on O
it O
and O
missing O
keys O
. O

I O
have O
it O
plugged O
in O
charging O
on O
my O
desk O
right O
now O
while O
I O
read O
it O
. O

The O
interior O
of O
the O
case O
has O
the O
space O
for O
a O
laptop O
and O
five O
small O
compartments O
- O
one O
zipper O
mesh O
and O
two O

but O
it O
just O
would O
n't O
go O
completely O
into O
the O
slot O
. O

Only O
other O
thing O
I O
can O
think O
to O
add O
here O
is O
that O
the O
package O
is O
very O
well O
done O
and O
really O
presents O
the O
product O
to O

A O
single O
press O
of O

the O

it O

Ca O
n't O
see O
any O
reason O
to O
spend O
so O
much O
more O
on O
the O
LaCie O

I O
will O
be O
ordering O
more O

I O
took O

This O
item O
is O
great O
for O
most O
charging O
and O
power O
applications O
but O
the O
USB O
charger O
is O
only O
sufficient O
to O

small O

i O
had O
it O
set O
up O
on O
a O

The O
instructions O
say O
you O
need O
to O
remove O
the O
whole O
case O
once O
a O
month O
and O
clean O
it O
so O
the O
dirt O
that O
gets O
inside O
wo O
nt O
scratch O
up O
your O

In O
other O
words O
they O
are O
strong O
inside O

and O
not O
exposed O
... O

Hope O
this O
helps O
! O

Bought O
this O
for O
an O
older O
laptop O
, O
no O
issues O
so O
far O
.. O

Overall O
, O
for O
what O
they O
are O
-- O
portable O
, O
small O
speakers O
-- O
they O
do O
the O
job O
, O
just O
do O
n't O
crank O
the O
volume O
up O
too O
much O
or O
you O
will O
certainly O
get O
distortion O
. O

This O
battery O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
just O
as O
well O
as O
an O
original O
Apple O
battery O
, O
for O
about O
one O
sixth O
of O
the O
cost O
( O
$ O
20 O
vs O
$ O
130 O
) O

I O
have O
a O
Nikon O
d5200 O
and O
multiple O
lenses O
and O
accessories O
. O

I O
use O
my O
MacBook O
in O
my O
home O
- O
based O
business O
and O
need O
to O
protect O
it O
when O
I O
travel O
. O

This O
lens O
cap O
is O
perhaps O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
in O
40 O
+ O
years O
of O
photography O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
defective O
or O
I O
must O
have O
freakishly O
small O
ears O
. O

The O
top O
of O
the O
speaker O
is O
completely O
interactive O
, O
having O
a O
convenient O
touch O
screen O
control O
panel O
for O
controlling O
volume O
, O
play O
/ O
pause O
and O
moving O
to O
the O
next O
track O
or O
the O
previous O
track O
. O

Maybe O
those O
complaining O
about O
volume O
did O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
PC O
volume O
controls O
all O
the O
way O
up O
. O

My O
4 O
brothers O
all O
have O
a O
pair O
now O
, O
as O
well O
as O
my O
cousin O
, O
who O
were O
jealous O
of O
my O
system O
after O
hearing O
the O
quality O
and O
seeing O
the O
price O
. O

How O
they O
could O
n't O
produce O
this O
in O
initial O
testing O

Did O
n't O
find O
it O
did O
much O
for O
my O
Zip O
Clip O
with O
any O
ear O
phones O
or O
head O
phones O
. O

So O
far O
we O
are O
30 O
days O
into O
usage O
and O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
replacement O
. O

I O
was O
recently O
upgraded O
to O
Comcast O
105 O
Mbs O
service O
download O
and O
with O
20 O
Mbs O
service O
upload O
. O

I O
also O
do O
not O
think O
the O
battery O
holds O
near O
as O
long O
as O
a O
charge O
. O

On O
1 O
GB O
it O
was O
hopeless O
, O
but O
this O
2 O
GB O
kit O
did O
the O
trick O
! O

Asus O
, O
I O
really O
love O
your O

typing O
this O
on O
my O

My O
OS O
is O
Windows O
XP O
SP3 O
. O

This O
is O
not O
, O
however O
, O
my O
primary O
application O
for O
them O
. O

Why O
pay O
10 O
% O
of O
that O
price O
for O
a O
hood O
? O

Unless O
you O
laptop O
is O
grossly O
thick O
, O
there O
is O
also O
room O
in O
that O
compartment O
for O
papers O
or O
folders O
but O
there O
is O
not O
a O
separator O
such O
as O
a O
nylon O
barrier O
that O
would O
keep O
any O
additional O
items O
from O
rubbing O
against O
your O
laptop O
. O

you O
should O
n't O
add O
this O
weight O
to O
your O
mac O
book O
air O
... O
its O
really O
a O
nonsense O
that O
I O
made O
... O
and O
by O
the O
way O
it O
fells O
and O
looks O
terrible O

Do O
n't O
buy O
coolers O
for O
MBP O
that O
stick O
close O
to O
the O
ground O
since O
they O
trap O
heat O
and O
may O
not O
help O
in O
heat O
dissipation O
. O

Either O
way O
I O
uninstalled O
the O
Bing O
toolbar O
and O
the O
anti O
- O
virus O
software O
, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
the O
garbage O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
. O

For O
those O
things O
, O
it O
is O
just O
what O
was O
needed O
. O

USB O
adapter O
- O

super O
easy O
to O
install O
( O
i O
did O
it O
myself O
with O
no O
instructions O
) O
. O

so O
they O
're O
not O
loose O
and O
are O
easy O
to O
find O
. O

120hz O
samples O
at O
4 O
times O
and O
will O
make O
it O
look O
even O
smoother O
.. O
but O
you O
would O
need O
a O
giant O
screen O
to O
note O
the O
difference O
. O

It O
DOES O
make O
the O
music O
louder O
and O
has O
a O
built O
- O
in O
EQ O
, O
but O
I O
do O
nt O
need O
my O
next O
door O
neighbors O
to O
hear O
what O
s O
playing O
on O
my O
headphones O
so O
this O
really O
did O
nt O
help O
me O
at O
all O
. O

Being O
able O
to O
see O
the O
quality O
, O
the O
fit O
, O
color O
, O
has O
definitely O
created O
interest O
. O

but O
so O
far O
the O
only O
problem O
I O
'm O
having O
is O
that O
if O
I O
use O
the O
AVi O
file O
( O
the O
native O
format O
it O
uses O
) O
I O
can O
play O
it O
on O
my O
mac O
but O
there O
is O
no O
sound O
. O

I O
am O
writing O
this O
from O
my O
second O
V7 O
- O

--- O
not O
by O
choice O
. O

The O
charger O
itself O
accepts O
12V O
input O
. O

Installing O
the O
Squeezebox O
server O
and O
some O
of O
the O
other O
apps O
was O
straightforward O
and O
easy O
, O
as O
is O
updating O
firmware O
. O

Save O
the O
money O
and O
order O
this O
one O
! O

I O
thought O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
nice O
option O
in O
case O
if O
I O
will O
have O
to O
work O
on O
some O
bluetooth O
- O
less O
box O
. O

That O
I O
can O
live O
with O
because O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
I O
have O
access O
to O
an O
electrical O
outlet O
. O

There O
is O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
padding O
on O
the O
front O
and O
back O
of O
the O
main O
compartment O
for O
protection O
. O

What O
really O
set O
this O
over O
the O
top O
for O
me O
is O
the O
speakers O
. O

Here O
's O
what O
I O
've O
discovered O
: O
Before O
, O
if O
I O
started O
to O
get O
download O
speeds O
upward O
of O
1Mb O
/ O
s O
, O
the O
fans O
would O
spin O
up O
and O
I O
'd O
get O
worried O
it O
might O
explode O
. O

Removed O
the O
2 O
GB O
and O
put O
the O
new O
memory O
in O
. O

Other O
than O
these O
two O
points O
, O
however O
, O
the O
VX-6000 O
one O
of O
the O
best O
webcams O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O

I O
simply O
put O
the O
transparent O
protective O
film O
that O
came O
with O
it O
over O
the O
edges O
to O
smooth O
it O
so O
it O
does O
not O
catch O
on O
something O
and O
scratch O
the O
surface O
under O
my O

It O
's O
a O

to O
review O
a O

which O
actually O
simplifies O

owns O
up O
to O
the O
promise O
which O
computer O

offered O
us O

rarely O

I O
need O

a O
few O

later O

But O
I O
cracked O
it O
open O
like O
an O
egg O
after O
I O
called O
the O
company O
. O

The O
same O
reviewer O
also O
stated O
that O
the O
usb O

was O
too O
long O

I O
found O
it O
just O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
was O
the O

This O
is O
a O
really O
impressive O
product O

That O
then O
brought O
up O

Even O
if O

I O
would O

this O
rotation O
home O
. O

I O
prefer O
to O
use O
the O
pen O
and O
switch O
it O
between O
mouse O
and O
pen O
mode O
( O
there O
's O
lots O
of O
ways O
how O
you O
can O
customize O
the O
tablet O
's O
functions O
) O
. O

I O
left O
it O
on O
overnight O
to O
see O
if O
they O
'd O
go O
away O
but O
no O
luck O
. O

Every O
one O
of O
these O
complaints O
are O
traits O
of O
many O
other O
laptops O
. O

There O
are O
many O
other O
items O
that O
you O
can O
use O
in O
place O
of O
a O
zipper O
. O

With O
a O
high O
quality O
gaming O
headset O
you O
hear O
the O
ambiance O
of O
the O
game O
that O
you O
did O
not O
realize O
you O
were O
missing O
until O
you O
use O
a O
high O
quality O
headset O
. O

I O
have O
had O
almost O
NO O
Apple O
experience O
in O
the O
last O
10 O
years O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
volume O
needed O
to O
be O
adjusted O
way O
down O
, O
so O
I O
recommend O
installing O
with O
your O
stereo O
/ O
amp O
/ O
headset O
turned O
way O
down O
or O
off O
. O

I O
've O
got O
a O
couple O
keyboard O
cases O
that O
save O
the O
day O
in O
that O
respect O

Functional O
use O

I O
've O
heard O
walky O
talkies O
with O
more O
range O
. O

the O
unit O
will O
need O
some O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
to O
have O
the O
patience O
to O
modify O
prfiles O
. O

I O
said O
what O
the O
heck O
and O
tried O
this O
stuff O
. O

My O
only O
tiny O
complaint O
is O

because O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
the O
length O
, O
I O
needed O
the O
volume O
- O
reduction O
to O
balance O
out O
the O
speakers O
) O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
relatively O
large O
and O
after O
some O
practice O
is O
relatively O
easy O
to O
type O
on O
. O

Shipping O
was O
amazingly O
fast O
. O

One O
of O
the O
features O
I O
liked O
of O
the O
first O
pack O
I O
ordered O
was O
the O
adjusters O
on O
the O
shoulder O
straps O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
apply O
this O
perfectly O
almost O
effortlessly O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
must O
have O
in O
your O
laptop O
bag O
. O

but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
flimsy O
, O

So O
have O
this O
in O
mind O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
plug O
such O
energy O
hunger O
devices O
to O
buy O
the O
5V O
Adapter O
. O

is O
a O
good O
think O
. O

from O
my O
experience O
buying O
a O
monitor O
screen O
this O
seller O
was O
great O
. O

.... O
there O
is O
the O
exact O
image O
of O
my O
Nexus O
on O
the O
large O
screen O
. O

One O
hint O
: O

if O
they O
are O
n't O
already O
. O

First O
of O
all O
screen O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
complain O
with O
the O
resolution O
but O
with O
the O
quality O
, O
The O
pictures O
wash O
away O
with O
slightest O
angle O
, O
Picture O
quality O
not O
even O
close O
to O
the O
$ O
350 O
Acer O
laptop O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
do O
heavy O
duty O
computing O
, O
I O
would O
get O
more O
memory O
but O
for O
email O
, O
letters O
, O
excel O
etc O
it O
is O
just O
fine O
. O

This O
backpack O
is O
indeed O
a O
great O
way O
to O
carry O
around O
a O
laptop O
and/or O
tablet O
. O

Worked O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
have O
used O
an O
HDMI O
cable O
to O
stream O
ESPN O
and O
Netflix O
on O
a O
TV O
while O
doing O
homework O
on O
my O
laptop O
and O
it O
handles O
it O

But O
when O
I O
am O
on O
the O
go O
, O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry O
and O
so O
lightweight O
. O

The O
zipper O
is O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
very O
sturdy O
and O
high O
quality O
. O

I O
charge O
my O
blackberry O
, O
a O
playbook O
and O
my O
fiances O
2 O
phones O

You O
can O
upload O
videos O
to O
YouTube O
, O
and O
email O
as O
well O
to O
your O
family O
and O
friends O
! O

nothing O
really O
came O
in O
the O
protective O
little O
baggies O
, O
but O
as O
long O
as O
everything O
works O
, O
i O
am O
happy O
. O

Firm O
enough O
to O
type O
comfortably O
, O
with O
a O
solid O
, O
no O
- O
flex O
backing O
. O

When O
I O
say O
a O
perfect O
fit O
, O
I O
also O
mean O
that O
there O
is O
no O
further O
space O
in O
the O
sleeve O
for O
the O
laptop O
peripherals O
, O

You O
have O
to O
turn O
it O
off O
pressing O
the O
blue O
button O
. O

Perfect O
fit O
of O
course O
and O
does O
not O
scratch O
your O
laptop O
as O
one O
user O
noted O

Usage O
is O
breeze O
and O
smooth;(4 O
) O

( O
but O
I O
have O
a O
microSD O
USB O
reader O

This O
works O
well O
with O
ipad O
, O
macbook O
pro O
, O
and O
iphone O
. O

but O
I O
guess O
they O
have O
to O
put O
something O
there O
because O
of O
the O
large O
screen O
. O

This O
is O
a O
well O
made O
cord O
with O
heavy O
duty O
connections O
. O

Now O
the O
wiring O
inside O
is O
exposed O
. O

It O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
, O
as O
little O
as O
it O
cost O
. O

You O
have O
full O
control O
. O

The O
velocity O
is O
the O
expected O
. O

Vista O
seems O
to O
be O
problemaic O
with O
many O
of O
these O
speakers O
, O
not O
so O
with O
the O
Sound O
Bite O
. O

Sound O
is O
average O
in O
class O
; O
you O
'll O
want O
headphones O
if O
you O
care O
about O
music O

but O
it O
's O
fine O
for O
YouTube O

, O
games O
, O
etc O
. O

much O

useless O
for O
audio O
? O
) O
, O
and O
even O
then O
ca O
n't O
get O
fully O
functional O
display O
due O
to O
some O
Mac O
technicality O
, O
according O
to O
Sirius O
techs O
. O

The O
one O
negative O
is O
that O
the O
great O
, O
swiveling O
jack O
form O
factor O
gets O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
the O
plug O
on O
my O
Magellan O
GPS O
because O
it O
's O
a O
little O
recessed O
such O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
plug O
it O
in O
all O
the O
way O
, O
so O
it O
's O
loose O
. O

The O
forward O
and O
pause O
buttons O
on O
the O
remote O

for O
Pandora O

The O
Mpeg4 O
movies O
look O
great O
when O
played O
on O
the O
11 O
. O
6 O
in O
screen O
. O

It O
's O
only O
OK O
because O
the O
strap O
kept O
falling O
off O
. O

I O
suspect O
this O
is O
the O
location O
of O
the O
video O
card O
and O
pushing O
1080 O
res O
. O

, O
I O
think O
this O
a O
very O
high O
quality O
product O

The O
Nabi O
was O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
, O
but O
all O
adults O
involved O
had O
reservations O
regarding O
a O
movement O
away O
from O
traditional O
learning O
as O
well O
as O
questioning O
the O
versatility O
of O
this O
tablet O
. O

Finding O
the O
BIOS O
menu O
on O
this O
thing O
for O
the O
Toshiba O
/ O
Asus O
uninitiated O
is O
a O
confirmation O
that O
someone O
is O
just O
trying O
to O
piss O
me O
off O
, O
Toshiba O
's O
instructions O
on O
BIOS O
access O
is O
as O
helpless O
as O
herpes O
with O
a O
single O
web O
page O
for O
" O
all O
systems O
made O
after O
XP/ O
/ O
... O
whelp O
hells O
bells O
Martha O
, O
that O
means O
for O
the O
last O
~10 O
years O
and O
they O
have O
at O
least O
six O
different O
ways O
to O
try O
regardless O
if O
you O
provide O
your O
hardware O
ID O
. O

I O
'm O
currently O
connected O
to O
a O
usb O
3 O
. O
0 O
hub O
so O
when O
I O
undock O
the O
hub O
, O
everything O
is O
left O
behind O
. O

, O
dvd O
eject O
button O

I O
am O
easily O
getting O
four O
hours O
plus O
of O
use O
out O
of O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

With O
music O
listening O
on O
the O
side O
, O
its O
3 O
hours O
. O

I O
hardly O
ever O
use O
the O
device O
and O
it O
has O
become O
and O
expensive O
toy O
for O
my O
10 O
year O
old O
instead O
of O
it O
's O
intended O
use O
as O
Daddy O
's O
toy O
! O

I O
had O
4 O
GB O
onboard O
& O
Apple O
wanted O
an O
insane O
amount O
of O
money O
for O
8 O
GB O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
your O
laptop O
, O
you O
get O
glare O
off O
of O
the O
screen O
, O
or O
in O
your O
eyes O
, O
or O
both O
. O

So O
I O
re O
- O
booted O
the O
laptop O
.. O

While O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
sling O
the O
bag O
into O
position O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
difficult O
to O
put O
back O
on O
your O
back O
with O
any O
real O
weight O
in O
the O
bag O
. O

I O
waited O
a O
while O
and O
sure O
enough O
this O
product O
hit O
the O
market O
and O
its O
GREAT O
! O

It O
gives O
the O
bag O
a O
sleeker O
feel O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
the O
Inspiron O
Duo O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
the O
perfect O
combination O
of O
both O
-- O
and O
it O
is O
-- O
with O
some O
catches O
. O

I O
chose O
the O
flat O
finish O
to O
eliminate O
reflections O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
adapter O
, O
so O
I O
can O
use O
it O
to O
see O
videos O
that O
I O
downloaded O
in O
my O
Eee O
PC O
on O
my O
TV O
. O

none O
of O
the O
others O
even O
compare O
. O

Nice O
design O
. O

And O
since O
the O
tablet O
can O
not O
take O
a O
hit O
for O
nuthin O
, O
it O
also O
provides O
extra O
layer O
of O
protection O
of O
sorts O
. O

I O
did O
install O
extra O
RAM O
right O
away O

I O
have O
heard O
Gateway O
will O
not O
do O
anything O
either O
but O
will O
try O
. O

It O
was O
so O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
it O
works O
as O
good O
as O
my O
other O
computer O
hooked O
up O
to O
the O
modem O
which O
is O
downstairs O
. O

The O
ASUS O
software O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
is O
a O
little O
funky O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
it O
next O
to O
me O
to O
compare O
, O
but O
that O
would O
be O
the O
only O
machine O
that O
may O
have O
equaled O
or O
surpassed O
this O
one O
for O
performance O
. O

Note O
that O
all O
other O
devices O
in O
the O
hub O
were O
working O
just O
fine O
. O

it O
does O
nt O
get O
hot O
at O
all O
. O

I O
've O
been O
a O
nature O
and O
wildlife O
photographer O
for O
about O
30 O
years O
and O
have O
traveled O
extensively O
with O
large O
amounts O
of O
camera O
gear O
. O

For O
$ O
10 O
this O
thing O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

It O
fits O
a O
little O
loose O
but O
it O
does O
not O
fall O
out O
or O
pull O
out O
too O
easily O
. O

I O
have O
a O
couple O
sitting O
around O
that O
worked O
fine O
, O
I O
think O
they O
are O
from O
an O
m14x O

and O
I O
was O
back O
up O
and O
running O
. O

The O
battery O
lasts O
around O
7 O
hours O
when O
I O
run O
the O
Mac O
OS O
( O
9600 O
graphics O
card O
turned O
off O
) O
. O

give O
it O
to O
my O
wife O

Most O
are O
painfully O
slow O
. O

e. O
uninstall O
Microsoft O
ACPI O
, O
clear O
all O
power O
, O
start O
laptop O
with O
AC O
power O
then O
install O
battery O
) O

Other O
than O
the O
packaging O
I O
am O
pleased O
. O

The O
speed O
and O
signal O
strength O
to O
my O
router O
are O
great O
. O

The O
feel O
of O
the O
touchpad O
is O
weird O
, O
because O
it O
's O
textured O
. O

It O
has O
elastic O
at O
the O
four O
corners O
to O
hold O
in O
the O
Kindle O
. O

Keyboard O
has O
also O
a O
good O
feel O
. O

It O
provides O
a O
nice O
, O
snug O
fit O
and O
is O
well O
made O
. O

It O
has O
a O
few O
shortcomings O
for O
those O
of O
you O
who O
need O
a O
bit O
more O
performance O
, O
but O
this O
laptop O
( O
nor O
any O
of O
the O
ultrabooks O
) O
is O
designed O
for O
super O
high O
- O
performance O
. O

I O
would O
have O
ordered O
a O
regular O
replacement O
battery O

Only O
complaint O
was O
not O
with O
the O
product O

WinTV O
is O
very O
cumbersome O
and O
slow O
, O
I O
notice O
a O
slightly O
better O
picture O
with O
it O
at O
this O
point O
, O
versus O
WMC O
, O
but O
WMC O
's O
functionality O
make O
it O
the O
preferred O
application O
. O

Good O
tactile O
feel O
when O
typing O
on O
the O
keys O
. O

It O
is O
compact O
and O
easy O
to O
cary O
as O
it O
has O
a O
very O
small O
usb O
connector O
that O
is O
actually O
stored O
within O
it O
. O

And O
for O
all O
the O
size O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
quite O
small O
and O
fiddly O
in O
feel O
, O
and O
off O
- O
center O
, O
because O
they O
've O
added O
a O
numeric O
keypad O
. O

This O
little O
guy O
has O
big O
sound O
for O
a O
small O
speaker O
and O
it O
does O
run O
for O
long O
periods O
on O
a O
single O
charge O
, O

Once O
a O
while O
, O
the O
charge O
LED O
on O
my O
laptop O
will O
keep O
flashing O
, O
I O
need O
to O
take O
out O
the O
battery O
and O
put O
back O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

I O
am O
super O
happy O
I O
bought O
the O
3 O
year O
no O
fault O
warranty O
. O

Rounding O
out O
the O
compliment O
of O
ports O
( O
on O
the O
left O
side O
only O
) O
is O
Gb O
ethernet O
, O
FireWire O
800 O
, O

I O
could O
n't O
play O
it O
on O
my O
dell O
with O
a O
core2duo O
and O
intergrated O
graphics O
, O
this O
one O
plays O
it O
on O
high O
. O

Recommend O
for O
reading O
those O
old O
disks O
so O
you O
can O
retrieve O
the O
data O
before O
it O
is O
lost O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
plug O
in O
my O
wireless O
G930 O
headset O
from O
Logitech O
. O

I O
only O
noticed O
the O
heavy O
bass O
in O
songs O
that O
have O
a O
noticeable O
bass O
anyways O
, O
but O
it O
was O
more O
noticeable O

great O
way O
to O
get O
power O
to O
all O
your O
devices O
on O
the O
go O
. O

The O
lid O
does O
not O
scratch O
easily O
. O

Their O
new O
policy O
severely O
limits O
streaming O
video O
and O
downloads O
. O

so O
we O
searched O
2 O
find O
a O
replacement O
& O
i O
was O
sceptical O
about O
not O
getting O
teh O
brands O
i O
knew O

This O
little O
device O
is O
very O
good O
. O

Have O
had O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

At O
least O
as O
good O
as O
the O
one O
it O
replaced O
( O
when O
it O
was O
new O
) O

So O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
into O
thinking O
that O
a O
DDR3 O
version O
of O
the O
same O
Netbook O
will O
outperform O
the O
DDR2 O
version O
. O

Constantly O
Windows O
7 O
would O
want O
to O
update O
this O
and O
if O
it O
did O
it O
would O
make O
it O
stop O
working O
. O

Installation O
is O
very O
easy O
. O

Only O
thing O
you O
need O
a O
dark O
to O
black O
mouse O
pad O
will O
not O
work O
good O
on O
anything O
light O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
mentioned O
a O
blue O
light O
, O
but O
my O
pad O
does O
not O
have O
a O
blue O
light O
.. O

It O
sets O
up O
easily O
in O
Skype O
but O
unfortunately O
, O
Skype O
requires O
a O
subscription O
of O
$ O
10 O
per O
month O
or O
$ O
5 O
for O
one O
session O
, O
which O
ended O
that O
idea O
. O

: O
Will O
definitely O
feel O
weird O
the O
first O
time O
you O
type O
with O
it O
on O
, O
trust O
me O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
a O
laptop O
and O
monitor O
and O
it O
works O
wonderfully O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
backpack O
I O
tried O
for O
my O
Alienware O
MX18 O
. O

If O
the O
bottom O
ends O
up O
cracking O
more O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
hesitate O
purchasing O
another O
from O
Kuzy O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
two O
that O
with O
two O
bays O
some O
users O
might O
even O
opt O
for O
more O
storage O
( O

good O
quality O
and O
very O
nice O
fit O
. O

6 O
x O
2 O
. O
2 O
inches O
provided O
by O
Amazon O
are O
totally O
wrong O
. O

Worked O
for O
two O
months O
, O
then O
died O
. O

It O
holds O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
's O
also O
useful O
if O
you O
need O
to O
glance O
at O
an O
old O
archive O
drive O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
PSU O
. O

Again O
, O
not O
as O
loud O
as O
the O
Belkin O
I O
had O
. O

Turn O
on O
the O
speaker O
with O
the O
on O
/ O
off O
switch O
in O
the O
back O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
well O
designed O
, O
with O
a O
minor O
quirk O
that O
there O
is O
some O
light O
bleed O
on O
the O
bright O
blue O
LEDs O
. O

If O
you O
were O
to O
throw O
this O
in O
a O
book O
bag O
, O
or O
accidentally O
sit O
on O
it O
, O
it O
wouldbe O
crushed O
in O
an O
instant O
. O

The O
bezel O
is O
a O
direct O
replacement O
part O
for O
the O
one O
installed O
on O
the O
Inspiron O
1545 O
, O
and O
indistinguishable O
from O
it O
after O
fitting O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
music O
listening O
goes O
, O
that O
's O
why O
I O
have O
earphones O
or O
headphones O
and O
this O
thing O
has O
a O
convenient O
audio O
jack O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
waterproof O
, O
but O
can O
take O
some O
water O
without O
any O
problem O
. O

I O
've O
added O
another O
500 O
gb O
to O
my O
Pogo O
storage O
with O
this O
little O
enclosure O
and O
I O
'm O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
this O
product O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
took O
the O
battery O
out O
reset O
the O
laptop O
and O
would O
n't O
you O
know O
it O
, O
all O
was O
well O
. O

It O
means O
you O
can O
bump O
up O
the O
performance O
for O
$ O
25 O
bucks O
with O
another O
stick O
of O
4 O
gb O
ram O
. O

One O
important O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
updates O
are O
required O
. O

Would O
buy O
again O
! O
! O

Oh O
this O
laptop O
was O
excellent O
. O

Windows O

appears O
to O
be O
finally O
relatively O
debugged O
for O
a O
first O

much O
better O
than O

that O

) O

The O
Bad O
: O
Windows O

. O

The O
battery O
which O
came O
with O
my O
unit O
would O
not O
keep O
a O
charge O
and O
was O
very O
unpredictable O
. O

What O
an O
AWESOME O
deal O

After O
switching O

on O
, O
I O
must O
also O
un O
- O

, O
then O
re O

the O
device O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
you O
notice O
about O
the O
Acer O
AS5810TZ-4274 O
is O
it O
's O
weight O
. O

With O
this O
little O
device O
you O
can O
expand O
your O
USB O
ports O
on O
your O

or O

The O
2 O
main O
glitches O
: O
first O
, O
the O
speaker O
does O
n't O
really O

when O
you O

that O

Usually O
the O

and O
my O

Talk O
about O
good O

I O
tried O
installing O
an O
updated O
version O
of O
BlueSolieil O
and O
that O
could O
n't O
find O
the O
device O
. O

Faced O
with O
either O
buying O
this O
or O
a O
fan O
speed O
controller O
, O
I O
elected O
to O
get O
this O
. O

Overall O
this O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
, O
long O
battery O
life O
, O
solid O
build O
and O
very O
stylish O
! O

I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
give O
it O
1 O
star O
although O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
. O

As O
good O
as O
the O
original O
. O

have O
continued O
to O

the O
more O
I O
use O

the O
more O

( O
I O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
the O
product O
worked O
well O
for O

, O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
extra O
couple O
bucks O
for O

I O
LOVE O
ITWhich O
explains O
my O
5 O
star O
rating O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

I O
have O
a O
7870 O
graphics O
card O
and O
it O
's O
long O
been O
my O
dream O
to O
run O
4 O
- O
5 O
monitors O
off O
of O
it O
. O

I O
got O
sick O
of O
it O
and O
since O
it O
's O
to O
late O
to O
return O
it O
I O
decided O
to O
open O
it O
up O
. O

After O
2 O
months O
, O
I O
gave O
up O
and O
threw O
it O
in O
the O
gargabe O

I O
am O
absolutely O
impressed O
and O
you O
will O
be O
too O
. O

- O
it O

only O
for O
AC O
wall O
current O
, O
and O
the O
number O
and O
type O
of O
tips O
out O
of O
the O
box O
varies O
depending O
on O
when/ O
where O
it O
was O
bought O
. O

but O
I O
'll O
round O
up O
because O
I O
do O
like O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
drive O
right O
after O
the O
tsunami O
wiped O
out O
many O
flash O
memory O
factories O
in O
Japan O
. O

I O
've O
used O
these O
for O
months O
and O
they O
all O
arrived O
in O
great O
working O
order O
& O
work O
just O
as O
they O
should O
. O

However O
, O
I O
should O
note O
there O
are O
many O
reviews O
warning O
the O
MD O
83612 O
adapter O
wiring O
breaks O
easily O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
enough O
to O
have O
an O
opinion O
on O
that O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
is O
a O
very O
hansome O
piece O
. O

So O
, O
I O
contacted O
Amazon O
and O
they O
promptly O
shipped O
a O
replacement O
. O

The O
mode O
indicators O
are O
well O
thought O
out O
. O

11 O

, O
it O
'll O
be O
like O
10 O
times O
faster O
than O
the O

. O

. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
no O
major O
problems O
here O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
is O
n't O
completely O
invisible O
- O
but O
it O
will O
look O
better O
in O
the O
end O
than O
a O
device O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
scratches O
on O
the O
glass O
. O

For O

If O
so O
, O
maybe O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
trackpad O
is O
also O
a O
turn O
- O
off O
. O

It O
never O
gets O
uncomfortable O
. O

but O
I O
've O
never O
been O
great O
with O
reading O
installation O
instructions O
, O
they O
're O
all O
nearly O
incomprehensible O
to O
me O
. O

This O
adapter O
mostly O
solved O
my O
problems O
although O
the O
Router O
still O
frequently O
goes O
down O
. O

When O
prompted O
to O
download O
an O
upgrade O
, O
I O
was O
hit O
with O
repeated O
error O
boxes O
. O

I O
like O
having O
an O
actual O
power O
button O
. O

is O
the O
fact O
they O
changedthe O
key O
board O
and O
removed O
the O
PageUP O
, O
Down O
, O
Home O
and O
End O
keys O
fromthe O

Grab O
your O
phone O
with O
the O
Chrome O
browser O
installed O
and O
you O
can O
pull O
that O
exact O
search O
tab O
right O
up O
. O

You O
can O
not O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

Otherwise O
a O
very O
nice O
little O
table O
with O
beautiful O
color O
. O

I O
usually O
just O
place O
it O
on O
the O
cabin O
top O
. O

but O
I O
am O
guessing O
the O
crop O
factor O

Lenovo O
makes O
great O
keyboards O
and O
this O
one O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
attach O
the O
stylus O
to O
your O
iPhone O
( O
into O
the O
headphone O
plug O
) O
, O
thus O
keeping O
it O
where O
needed O
. O

Holds O
my O
tablet O
good O
, O
looks O
good O
, O
feels O
sturdy O
. O

but O
I O
did O
nt O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
so O
loud O
. O

Yes O
VERBATIN O
! O
! O
! O

internet O
connections O
are O
very O
good O
and O
screen O
resolution O
is O
good O
too O
. O

First O
off O
, O
Amaon O
Basics O
just O
get O
the O
good O
stuff O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
plug O
? O

also O
no O
shutter O
lockup O
position O
for O
long O
exposure O
. O

This O
has O
been O
my O
main O
bag O
for O
a O
year O
now O
. O

I O
was O
told O
I O
might O
encounter O
this O
type O
of O
plug O
in O
Hong O
Kong O

I O
never O
seen O
a O
blue O
screen O
since O
my O
K53 O
or O
had O
a O
AsusTek O
product O
fail O
- O
that O
speaks O
to O
me O
about O
their O
quality O
, O
since O
I O
had O
PCs O
that O
showed O
me O
nothing O
but O
errors O
in O
the O
past).Every O
product O
has O

I O
am O
also O
able O
to O
get O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
gear O
in O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

Last O
about O
25 O
% O
less O
than O
my O
O. O
E. O
battery O
but O
for O
less O
than O
half O
who O
cares O
. O

I O
stand O
the O
iPod O
up O
in O
it O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
wobble O
at O
all O
unlike O
any O
other O
adapter O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
for O
an O
iPod O
speaker O
system O
including O
BOSE O
. O

Given O
that O
my O
express O
card O
slot O
was O
previously O
empty O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
, O
but O
I O
wish O
it O
worked O
at O
the O
right O
speed O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
far O
better O
solution O
than O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
terrible O
Xbox O
wireless O
connection O
or O
a O
50 O
' O
cable O
strung O
through O
the O
house O
between O
Xbox O
and O
router O
. O

Nice O
to O
not O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
cord O

Bought O
this O
adapter O
based O
upon O
feedback O
of O
others O
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
imminent O
new O
releases O
of O
both O
Adobe O
programs O
are O
supposed O
to O
rectify O
this O
problem O

I O
have O
several O
of O
these O
drives O
of O
various O
sizes O
and O
ages O
. O

It O
arrived O
within O
a O
few O
days O
and O
works O
great O
! O

I O
might O
as O
well O
just O
pay O
significantly O
less O
money O
and O
get O
a O
netbook O
/ O
laptop O
rather O
than O
a O
tablet O
if O
that O
were O
the O
case O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
often O
take O
my O
laptop O
with O
me O
home O

Turns O
out O
, O
Vista O
has O
a O
certain O
built O
- O
in O
newer O
protocol O
for O
such O
networking O
, O
which O
XP O
/ O
SP3 O
does O
not O
. O

If O
this O
is O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
you O
this O
battery O
is O
a O
good O
option O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Small O
screen O
is O
actually O
pretty O
usable O
. O

And O
erase O
built O
in O
OS O
. O

Good O
product O
that O
's O
very O
reliable O
so O
far O
. O

I O
do O
like O
this O
cover O
and O
the O
orange O
. O

The O
" O
low O
" O
price O
I O
paid O
no O
longer O
seems O
so O
low O
. O

The O
two O
front O
pockets O
on O
the O
bag O
, O
which O
expand O
generously O
, O
have O
Velcro O
flaps O
and O
the O
main O
flap O
then O
covers O
those O
pockets O
. O

The O
rip O
- O
stop O
fabric O
is O
well O
made O
and O
put O
together O
. O

The O
big O
thing O
that O
changed O
it O
all O
for O
me O
is O
VMWare O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
I O
would O
give O
this O
a O
4 O
out O
of O
5 O
stars- O

The O
instructions O
are O
simple O
, O
well O
- O
written O
and O
clear O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
laptop O
that O
uses O
an O
HP O

, O
this O
is O
NOT O
what O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
. O

, O
it O
only O
came O
with O
1 O
harddrive O
, O
but O
I O
added O
a O
second O
one O
immediately O
after O
I O
got O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
reverse O
polarity O
indicator O
does O
not O
work O
( O
it O
used O
to O
light O
up O
) O
. O

With O
an O
anticipated O
use O
for O
travel O
and O
possibly O
no O
access O
to O
a O
laptop O
for O
recharging O
, O
and O
for O
hotel O
and O
car O
travel O
, O
this O
item O
fits O
the O
bill O
perfectly O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
cooler O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
it O
would O
help O
extend O
my O
hp O
laptop O
's O
screen O
life O

in O

I O

able O
to O
move O
another O
screw O
inside O
the O
unit O
to O
make O
it O
work O
though O
. O

My O
son O
has O
a O
very O
old O
shuffle O
, O
he O
also O
has O
it O
filled O
with O
music O

This O
is O
a O
well O
made O
, O
sturdy O
, O
good O
- O
looking O
stylish O
cover O
. O

An O
improvement O
to O
the O
onboard O
Sony O
speakers O
( O
which O
is O
saying O
something O
) O
. O

is O
, O
for O
me O
photography O
is O
turning O
into O
a O
full O

hobby O
/ O
obsession O
and O

ExpressCard O

I O
had O
no O
way O
to O
benefit O
from O

Gives O
you O
too O
much O
to O
think O
about O
VIZIO O
quality O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
I O
will O
buy O
it O

I O

And O
its O
a O

Only O
complaint O
is O
that O
its O
a O
little O
short O
. O

It O
ends O
up O
being O
a O
little O
lumpy O
, O
but O
it O
works O

And O
if O
you O
can O
bring O
some O
of O
your O
own O
DVD O

to O
a O
place O
like O

and O
try O
the O
A650 O

, O
you O
will O
see O
how O
great O
the O
picture O
quality O
is O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
pretty O
unique O
and O
are O
actually O
integrated O
into O
the O
laptop O
's O
battery O
and O
produce O
a O
fantastic O
range O
of O
sound O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

Autofocus O
makes O
using O
it O
very O
pleasant O
Resolution O
is O
much O
higher O
that O
Skype O
and O
other O
Internet O
video O
applications O
require O
therefore O
digital O
zoom O
can O
be O
used O
without O
deterioration O
of O
picture O

Simple O
design O
. O

especially O
when O
I O
'm O
using O
photoshop O
to O
zoom O
in O
and O
out O
( O
or O
other O
quick O
key O
function O
) O
, O
it O
would O
freeze O
and O
lose O
control O
over O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
buying O
another O
router O
with O
proper O
usb O
access O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
think O
there O
are O
3 O
or O
4 O
presets O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
because O
there O
is O
nothing O
visual O
to O
denote O
that O
a O
change O
has O
been O
made O
. O

It O
has O
a O
nice O
thickness O
and O
feel O
to O
it O
. O

I O
am O
a O
computer O
god O
. O

The O
price O
is O
over O
a O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
2 O
years O
of O
3 O
g O
service O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
little O
brother O
of O
this O
machine O
( O
11 O
" O
X202E O
) O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
served O
me O
well O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
tried O
tweaking O
the O
settings O
, O
because O
so O
far O
, O
I O
am O
totally O
satisfied O
. O

If O
you O
want O
an O
easy O
to O
use O
camera O
with O
pro O

for O
less O
than O
$ O
400 O
used O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
better O
than O
the O
Canon O
VIXIA O
HF10 O
, O

It O
provides O
2560x1440 O
resolution O
only O
with O
certain O
input O
types O
. O

Samsungs O
sound O
is O
very O
tinny O
, O
and O
you O
really O
ca O
nt O
exceed O
the O
volumn O
level O
, O
as O
it O
will O
cause O
distortion O
. O

It O
works O
exactly O
as O
I O
expected O
. O

These O
USB O
extension O
cables O
can O
NOT O
be O
used O
for O
power O
; O

I O
do O
have O
typically O
have O
the O
treble O
control O
turned O
" O
down O
" O
a O
tiny O
bit O
( O
perhaps O
5 O
- O
10 O
degrees O
to O
the O
left O
) O
, O
to O
take O
the O
edge O
off O
of O
the O
slight O
brightness O
of O
the O
tweeters O
. O

and O
it O
put O
on O
about O
6 O
garbage O
programs O
that O
i O
ca O
nt O
delete O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
glad O
I O
got O
this O
on O
sale O

Does O
n't O
make O
sense O
to O
stick O
a O
thin O
, O
stylish O
iPad O
into O
this O
bulky O
, O
unstylish O
bag O
. O

They O
include O
a O
small O
USB O
cord O
so O
you O
can O
locate O
the O
receiver O
unit O
in O
a O
convenient O
spot O
for O
a O
desk O
top O
also O
. O

Fortunately O
they O
work O
just O
fine O
for O
audiobooks O
, O
which O
is O
about O
half O
of O
my O
headphone O
use O
. O

I O
only O
noticed O
it O
when O
I O
'm O
alone O
in O
my O
room O
, O
and O
even O
then O
it O
never O
bothers O
me O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
more O
expensive O
bags O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
one O
is O
more O
compact O
, O
yet O
allows O
ample O
space O
for O
plenty O
of O
equipment O
. O

The O
only O
criteria O
they O
have O
to O
meet O
is O

Include O

Chromebook O
comes O
with O
only O
a O

re O

encoding O
each O
and O
every O
video O
in O

friendly O

, O
you O
will O
find O
a O
very O
sporadic O
support O
. O

It O
does O
provide O
power O
, O
not O
very O
clean O
though O
, O
to O
the O
laptop O
which O
does O
function O
off O

it O

or O
you O
'll O
have O
two O
installed O
on O
your O
PC O
. O

I O
have O
not O
tried O
connecting O
the O
infolink O

It O
certainly O
has O
the O
power O
to O
drive O
every O
headphone O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

At O
the O
time O
there O
were O
n't O
many O
options O
at O
this O
native O
resolution O
. O

I O
've O
only O
tried O
this O
on O
myself O
, O
not O
with O
multiple O
user O
accounts O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
6 O
foot O
single O
extender O
and O
plugged O
the O
Monster O
in O
and O
have O
it O
sitting O
on O
my O
bed O
side O
table O
. O

Just O
a O
reminder O
that O
you O
need O
to O
plug O
it O
in O
after O
you O
boot O
up O
and O
everything O
is O
running O
. O

The O
first O
cover O
I O
purchased O
lasted O
8 O
months O
, O
then O
the O
leather O
cracked O
on O
the O
side O
. O

The O
HE O
is O
pretty O
fast O
( O
provided O
you O
increase O
the O
RAM O
to O
2Gb O
) O
, O
the O
screen O
is O
bright O
, O
storage O
is O
surely O
adequate O
for O
this O
type O
of O
machine O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
astonishing O
. O

I O
also O
use O
iTunes O

over O

for O
my O
iPhone O

and O
battery O
life O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
affected O

section O

The O
one O
I O
got O
seemed O
well O
- O
made O
, O
but O
would O
not O
take O
a O
charge O
at O
all O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
good O
quality O
item O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
have O
very O
fine O
construction O
, O
I O
anticipate O
that O
this O
Messenger O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O

i O
have O
nt O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
monster O
yet O
as O
a O
customer O
. O

The O
plugs O
are O
made O
of O
blue O
metal O
, O
which O
adds O
to O
the O
feeling O
of O
heft O
. O

it O
has O
tons O
of O
varying O
compartments O
for O
all O
your O
computer O
needs O
- O
I O
use O
it O
to O
carry O
my O
laptop O
which O
is O
a O
Dell O
Inspiron O
, O
a O
mouse O
, O
charger O
, O
a O
few O
computer O
games O
in O
dvd O
cases O
, O
and O
some O
pads O
and O
pens O
. O

If O
this O
AB O
sleeve O
is O
n't O
perfect O
, O
well O
close O
enough O
. O

The O
fan O
is O
noisy O
and O
runs O
continuously O
. O

She O
loves O
it O
for O
her O
macbook O
, O
and O
bought O
another O
one O
for O
her O
hubby O
. O

Good O
looking O
. O

, O
It O
allowed O
me O
to O
make O
quick O
changes O
, O
it O
loaded O
really O
fast O
, O
Explorer O
or O
Firefox O
loaded O
just O
as O
fast O
, O
normally O
Firefox O
is O
quicker O
. O

I O
have O
wiggled O
and O
jiggled O
it O
and O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
loosening O
up O
. O

Another O
issue O
with O
Bluetooth O
are O
the O
potential O
interferences O
from O
other O
wireless O
devices O
. O

The O
fan O
works O
good O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
! O

Great O
product O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
the O
histogram O
of O
the O
photo O
I O
was O
printing O
was O
too O
far O
to O
the O
left O
. O

I O
would O
hit O
tjMax O
( O
100 O
C O
) O
during O
games O
and O
get O
auto O
- O
power O
off O
. O

I O
have O
an O
iPhone O
with O
a O
bulky O
otter O
case O

If O
you O
're O
still O
unsure O
, O
go O
to O
Best O
Buy O
or O
Circuit O
City O
and O
see O
it O
for O
yourself O
, O
just O
make O
sure O
they O
have O
it O
adjusted O
right O
. O

i O
purchased O
this O
product O
on O
september O
19th O
, O
and O
it O
is O
now O
october O
26th O
.. O
and O
the O
charger O
has O
ceased O
to O
function O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
no O
denying O
that O
the O
resolution O
on O
this O
machine O
is O
far O
superior O
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
budget O
model O
that O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

So O
instead O
I O
'd O
purchase O
a O
nicely O
built O
desktop O
, O
for O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
price O
. O

This O
is O
a O
product O
that O
I O
'm O
figuring O
I O
can O
hang O
on O
to O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
through O
multiple O
cell O
phones O
. O

but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
take O
several O
HD O
pics O
during O
a O
trip O
I O
would O
recommend O
buying O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
or O
just O
buy O
a O
bigger O
card O
. O

I O
'm O
kind O
of O
a O
hard O
- O
ass O
like O
that O
. O

Has O
n't O
exploded O
yet O
, O
does O
n't O
get O
OVERLY O
hot O
, O
and O
keeps O
my O
computer O
running O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
Beats O
Edition O
HP O
for O
about O
six O
months O
now O
. O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
lug O
my O
power O
gear O
when O
I O
am O
playing O
at O
a O
friend O
's O
place O
. O

The O
charge O
time O
is O
short O
.. O
less O
than O
60 O
minutes O

I O
used O
a O
little O
canned O
air O
to O
blow O
off O
the O
junk O
under O
the O
keys O
. O

It O
worked O
great O
for O
the O
docking O
station O
. O

The O
item O
description O
should O
clearly O
state O
that O
the O
unit O
only O
works O
on O
120v O
current O
and O
is O
not O
usable O
in O
Europe O
or O
most O
of O
the O
world O
. O

My O
life O
's O
not O
THAT O
busy O
. O

I O
had O
this O
router O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
it O
is O
running O
great O
. O

When O
I O
first O
turned O
the O
laptop O
on O
, O
it O
did O
its O
usual O
loading O
for O
the O
first O
time O
thing O
, O
and O
having O
to O
make O
an O
account O
for O
it O
and O
such O
. O

But O
this O
works O
very O
well O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O

Although O
it O
is O
charged O
by O
USB O
it O
is O
charged O
by O
mini O
USB O
instead O
of O

SD O
card O
sticks O
out O
when O
installed O

, O
for O

model O
: O

It O
is O
very O
well O
made O
. O

YOU O
MAY O
NOT O
KNOW O
THIS O

It O
skips O
around O
some O
, O
and O
is O
inconsistent O
in O
sensitivity O
. O

The O
wide O
angle O
is O
n't O
wide O
. O

also O
the O
lenovo O
logo O
on O
the O
cover O
has O
started O
to O
fall O
off O
. O

This O
is O
a O
small O
thing O
, O
but O
I O
have O
gotten O
several O
things O
from O
them O
and O
they O
are O
all O
a O
little O
better O
than O
what O
they O
replaced O
. O

I O
wound O
up O
repairing O
the O
strap O
holder O
because O
I O
like O
the O
design O
of O
the O
bag O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
case O
is O
great O
for O
2 O
+ O
kids O
to O
view O
one O
TV O
. O

Playing O
DVDs O
at O
1080p O
is O
an O
amazing O
experience O
for O
me O
who O
is O
stepping O
up O
from O
a O
27inch O
720p O
set O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
surprisingly O
short O
even O
with O
advanced O
power O
saving O
features O
. O

Best O
laptop O
so O
far O
. O

I O
never O
promise O
or O
even O
hint O
that O
accepting O
a O
free O
item O
for O
review O
will O
result O
in O
a O
' O
good O
' O
review._________________________________________Many O
of O
us O
, O
I O
imagine O
, O
are O
short O
of O
USB O
ports O
these O
days O
or O
wished O
they O
had O
more O
. O

Incredible O
display O
. O

but O
I O
find O
it O
bewildering O

It O
can O
do O
extremely O
simple O
tasks O
like O
cropping O
and O
brightness O
adjustment O
, O
and O
that O
's O
it O
. O

He O
has O
been O
of O
great O
help O
in O
my O
understanding O
of O
a O
MAC O
Computer O
vs O
the O
PC O
I O
have O
always O
used O
. O

Very O
easy O
to O
setup O
using O
the O
supplied O
drivers O
. O

TRUE O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
speeds O
. O

The O
video O
appears O
choppy O
at O
times O
. O

There O
was O
no O
break O
up O
with O
the O
Blue O
Tooth O
and O
that O
accounts O
for O
the O
4 O
stars O
but O
all O
and O
all O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
unit O
. O

I O
purchased O
Sandisk O
because O
they O
are O
a O
trusted O
name O
in O
the O
memory O
market O
. O

I O
final O
positive O
on O
this O
product O
is O
that O
it O
has O
multiple O
Howard O
USB O
ports O
which O
are O
nice O
for O
recharging O
. O

I O
do O
believe O
though O
all O
the O
reviews O
for O
the O
kick O
ass O
speakers O
should O
be O
erased O
and O
not O
used O
for O
this O
panda O
speaker O
. O

I O
just O
had O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
was O
aligned O
correctly O
. O

The O
orange O
interior O
makes O
finding O
things O
easy O
( O
which O
is O
great O
) O
, O
especially O
compared O
to O
finding O
things O
in O
black O
- O
lined O
bags O
. O

new O
computers O
come O
with O
these O
days O
. O

the O
shipping O
was O
very O
fast O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
a O
cheap O
( O
but O
still O
sorta O
sturdy O
... O
) O

Fujitsu O
has O
essentially O
pushed O
past O
them O
and O
others O
including O
the O
OQO O
. O

so O
far O
all O
I O
see O
are O
a O
128 O
GB O
SSD/4 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
version O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O
there O
's O
a O
top O
front O
pocket O
, O
by O
the O
handle O

There O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
pins O
to O
the O
computer O
so O
you O
can O
just O
jump O
to O
one O
place O
or O
another O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
my O
little O
daughter O
also O
sometimes O
uses O
it O
and O
because O
I O
tend O
to O
resell O
my O
Macs O
when O
the O
warranty O
runs O
out O
. O

Finally O
, O
disturbing O
that O
frequently O
plugging O
and O
unplugging O
will O
trip O
something O
to O
make O
it O
shut O
down O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
try O
getting O
further O
away O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
at O
the O
sturdy O
aluminium O
construction O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
requires O
no O
tools O
is O
a O
definite O
plus O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
as O
to O
why O
this O
works O
for O
some O
1505 O
's O
and O
not O
for O
others O
. O

My O
two O
designers O
say O
they O
'd O
buy O
this O
system O
again O
if O
they O
needed O
a O
new O
computer O
, O
where O
I O
'm O
still O
holding O
out O
for O
a O
super O
new O
21 O
. O

It O
is O
very O
well O
made O
, O
sturdy O
and O
appears O
to O
be O
well O
suited O
for O
some O
rugged O
use O
. O

and O
I O
meet O
new O
friends O
who O
need O
to O
plug O
in O
as O
well O
. O

Ca O
n't O
give O
it O
a O
higher O
score O
or O
I O
would O
. O

now O
, O
its O
at O
0 O
and O
ca O
n't O
keep O
a O
charge O
so O
its O
no O
better O
than O
a O
desktop O

Upon O
initial O
start O
- O
up O
you O
should O
create O
restore O
discs O
or O
a O
driver O
disc O
if O
you O
plan O
on O
doing O
a O
clean O
Windows O
7 O
install O
. O

Stable O
performance O
and O

1 O
surround O
only O
lets O
its O
limitations O
become O
more O
prominent O
. O

It O
worked O
well O
, O
and O
I O
could O
enter O
notes O
from O
my O
keyboard O
into O
MIDI O
applications O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
card O
last O
December O
. O

Thanks O
though O

three O
stars O
for O
purely O
personal O
view O
not O
performance O
of O
product O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
if O
you O
hit O
the O
keys O
vertically O
. O

So O
now O
we O
have O
a O
traveling O
speaker O
that O
is O
small O
, O
portable O
and O
able O
to O
go O
anywhere O
we O
do O
for O
music O
or O
ambient O
sounds O
. O

It O
has O
56 O
watts O
of O
power O
total O
has O
a O
surprising O
amount O
of O
bass O
. O

Each O
one O
was O
screwed O
into O
my O
outlets O
to O
keep O
them O
from O
falling O
out O
. O

Made O
my O
wife O
's O
laptop O
work O
again O
! O
! O

I O
made O
one O
call O
to O
Lenovo O
Tech O
Support O
and O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
my O
hold O
time O
was O
brief O
, O
and O
the O
support O
person O
was O
very O
knowledgeable O
and O
polite O
. O

Peace O
of O
mind O
from O
the O
manufacture O
warranty O
and O
certification O
specification O
. O

If O
you O
're O
really O
anti O
- O
Chromebook O
, O
just O
remember O
that O
the O
more O
these O
devices O
are O
purchased O
and O
used O
by O
consumers O
, O
the O
better O
your O
Windows O
or O
Apple O
OS O
machines O
should O
get O
. O

Next O
, O
to O
the O
hp O
dv9000 O

And O
, O
the O
fiber O
optic O
backlighting O
( O
when O
ambient O
lighting O
is O
down O
) O
has O
been O
a O
pleasure O
. O

but O
I O
ca O
n't O
be O
bothered O
to O
get O
a O
replacement O
again O
. O

7 O
anyways O
, O
but O
so O
far O
this O
tablet O
has O
been O
amazing O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
almost O
a O
year O

UPDATEThere O
is O
a O
well O
known O
trick O
for O
changing O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
ported O
woofer O
. O

This O
is O
so O
small O
it O
would'nt O
fit O
a O
14 O
" O
laptop O
..... O

when O
it O
comes O
to O
my O
gadget O
and O
accessories O
, O
I O
recently O
brought O
this O
sleeve O
for O
mac O
book O
pro O
13 O
' O
retina O
display O
. O

Give O
it O
5 O
years O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
every O
camera O
will O
have O
this O
capability O
, O
but O
for O
now O
, O
this O
WiFi O
SD O
Memory O
card O
is O
a O
wonderful O
bridge O
device O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O
FiiO O
E5 O
amplifier O
after O
reading O
other O
reviews O
of O
it O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
Laptop O
cover O
for O
the O
Sony O
Vaio O
laptop O
and O
its O
a O
perfect O
fit O
for O
the O
Laptop O
size O
specified O
. O

It O
's O
a O
special O
need O
. O

This O
is O
a O
real O
Apple O
MagSafe O
power O
adapter O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
to O
use O
the O
dual O
USB O
plugs O
on O
any O
system O
so O
far O
. O

it O
's O
still O
super O
portable O
, O
and O
can O
be O
used O
as O
both O
an O
office O
computer O
, O
and O
a O
home O
media O
center O
. O

It O
's O
nicely O
padded O
and O
there O
are O
convenient O
zip O
- O
pockets O
for O
all O
the O
accessories O
which O
come O
with O
the O
player O
along O
with O
space O
for O
DVDs O
inside O
their O
cases O
. O

Should O
have O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
experience O
with O
using O
a O
Wireless O
adapter O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
HTC O
One O
M8 O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
gigabit O
Ethernet O
card O
for O
two O
years O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
back O
in O
early O
2012 O
and O
it O
works O
on O
my O
dv5 O
t O
laptop O
nicely O
as O
It O
was O
needed O
because O
I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
image O
editing O
and O
3d O
sculpting O
but O
too O
bad O

Solidly O
built O
. O

This O
cam O
is O
so O
good O
, O
I O
received O
it O
on O
2 O
- O
30 O
- O
2013 O
, O
and O
my O
brother O
made O
me O
order O
him O
one O
on O
2 O

- O
2013,(the O
next O

Be O
sure O
that O
you O
read O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
connect O
( O
anything O
that O
has O
red O
and O
white O
audio O
output O
) O
into O
a O
3 O
. O
5 O
audio O
in O
, O
then O
this O
is O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
you O
. O

This O
can O
speed O
up O
the O
process O
of O
install O
should O
your O
computer O
need O
to O
install O
any O
necessary O
drivers O
. O

Since O
about O
10 O
years O
ago O
when O
a O
friend O
who O
works O
for O
IBM O
's O
corporate O
storage O
solutions O
department O
gave O
me O
a O
8 O
MB O
Flash O
Drive O
, O
I O
've O
purchased O
a O
few O
hundred O
USB O
drives O
by O
dozens O
of O
manufacturers O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
seems O
longer O
than O
the O
previous O
model O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
even O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
with O
this O
item O
. O

The O
package O
came O
bundled O
with O
a O
mini O
CD O
that O
included O
bluesoleil O
6 O
. O

It O
blends O
perfectly O
with O
most O
receivers O
and O
looks O
like O
an O
AV O
component O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
cheap O
desktop O
PC O
case O
. O

I O
can O
definitely O
have O
it O
for O
a O
backup O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
those O
situations O
where O
the O
price O
and O
fact O
that O
this O
worked O
out O
so O
well O
make O
you O
say O
WOW O
. O

We O
live O
about O
50 O
miles O
from O
the O
closest O
station O
. O

( O
The O
ejection O
process O
is O
annoying O
because O
my O
external O
hard O
drive O
sometimes O
does O
not O
stop O
immediately O
) O
. O

so O
it O
SEEMS O
to O
be O
an O
issue O
. O

When O
the O
general O
public O
finds O
out O
more O
about O
it O
, O
it O
will O
spread O
like O
wildfire O
. O

For O
school O
as O
of O
yet O
I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
, O
with O
every O
program O
I O
have O
needed O
so O
far O
runs O
smoothly O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
numberpads O
, O
so O
I O
sacrificed O
the O
keypad O
and O
assigned O
a O
slew O
of O
non O
- O
character O
keys O
to O
it O
using O
a O
freeware O
app O
called O
KeyTweak O
. O

At O
first O
she O
was O
n't O
too O
excited O
about O
it O
because O
it O
looks O
kinda O
chunky O

like O
I O
did O
on O
this O
one O
. O

I O
carry O
my O
15 O
. O
6 O
" O
laptop O
, O
fluke O
test O
set O
, O
fiber O
light O
meter O
, O
volt O
meter O
, O
an O
assortment O
of O
power O
/ O
telemtry O
wire O
/ O
fibers O
, O
and O
work O
folders O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

You O
may O
be O
tempted O
to O
buy O
an O
external O
optical O
drive O
to O
install O
additional O
software O
, O
but O
that O
may O
not O
be O
necessary O
. O

... O
that O
turns O
this O
gorgeous O
tablet O
into O
a O
powerful O
notebook O
. O

I O
do O
agree O
with O
the O
reviewer O
who O
said O
it O
would O
n't O
work O
well O
in O
bed O
: O

The O
USB O
cord O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
either O
right O
or O
left O
side O
depending O
on O
the O
location O
of O
your O
USB O
port O
on O
the O
laptop O
. O

Just O
in O
case O
people O
do O
n't O
realize O
, O
this O
system O
is O
a O
Chromebook O
, O
not O
a O
Windows O
system O
. O

Power O
- O
wise O
, O
this O
system O
does O
just O
fine O
. O

Have O
not O
had O
to O
use O
this O
yet O
and O
hopefully O
will O
not O
have O
to O
. O

That O
resets O
the O
speaker O
then O
I O
can O
play O
my O
audible O
audio O
book O
. O

overall O
, O
I O
liked O
it O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
cable O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Your O
typing O
might O
slow O
down O
a O
tad O
bit O
as O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
... O
also O
because O
your O
fingers O
will O
stick O
to O
the O
silicon O
more O
so O
than O
the O
actual O
keys O
... O
but O
overall O
it O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

It O
feels O
secure O
in O
my O
hands O
without O
adding O
a O
lot O
of O
bulk O
. O

Best O
, O
it O
's O
made O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
use O
the O
netbook O
without O
removing O
it O
from O
the O
case O
- O
at O
least O
for O
short O
times O
. O

Excellent O
lens O
caps O
. O
. O
. O
as O
good O
as O
or O
better O
than O
the O
originals O
that O
come O
with O
most O
lenses O
. O

The O
straps O
have O
excellent O
padding O
and O
are O
very O
comfy O
on O
the O
wearer O
; O
I O
like O
and O
use O
the O
chest O
strap O
too O
, O
which O
is O
something O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
backpacks O
lack O
as O
well O
. O

6 O
" O
samsonite O
bag O
comfortably O
without O
feeling O
large O
or O
bulky.- O

and O
I O
saw O
his O
back O
lighted O
keyboard O
, O
I O
knew O
my O
other O
laptop O
was O
going O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

BTW O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
any O
software O
. O

This O
adapter O
allowed O
me O
to O
utilize O
the O
mSATA O
slot O
for O
my O
Sandisk O
( O
Model O
830 O
) O

You O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
, O
sort O
of O
. O

Also O
the O
bulk O
of O
this O
item O
makes O
it O
a O
poor O
choice O
for O
travel O
with O
a O
netbook O
. O

All O
tests O
were O
done O
with O
the O
Class O
6 O
Speed O
SD O
Cards O
that O
were O
brand O
new O
. O

It O
is O
also O
suppose O
to O
have O
voltage O
on O
the O
center O
pin O
and O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
sleeve O
connector O
. O

The O
third O
expandable O
pocket O
is O
the O
roomiest O
and O
includes O
a O
fabric O
divider O
so O
that O
you O
can O
organize O
books O
, O
file O
folders O
or O
papers O
. O

It O
's O
saving O
me O
60 O
dollars O
a O
month O
in O
internet O
fees O
..... O

Infact O
the O
adapater O
does O
have O
HP O
label O
and O
part O
number O
on O
it O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
this O
LaCie O
HDD O
came O
with O
a O
2 O
year O
manufacturer O
's O
warranty O
. O

Asked O
for O
help O
but O
got O
none O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
had O
to O
send O
this O
product O
back O
. O

The O
cord O
is O
a O
great O
length O
to O
cover O
your O
whole O
keyboard O
! O

Some O
plastic O
bags O
can O
create O
up O
to O
70 O
, O
000 O
Volts O
of O
static O
electricity O
when O
items O
are O
removed O
from O
them O
. O

However O
, O
very O
nice O
for O
when O
presenters O
have O
their O
own O
laptops O
. O

will O
not O
hold O
an O
11 O
. O
6 O
netbook O
! O

Arrived O
on O
time O
, O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
BIOS O
excepted O
. O

I O
now O
actually O
get O
four O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
on O
a O
single O
charge O
. O

If O
there O
are O
any O
alternatives O
, O
I O
'd O
look O
at O
them O
first O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
item O
to O
others O
and O
think O
the O
price O
is O
reasonable O
. O

For O
this O
price O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
's O
looking O
for O
something O
descent O
to O
protect O
their O
iPad O
. O

1 O
, O
together O
with O
a O
custom O
- O
built O
kernel O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
process O
scheduling O
with O
the O
stock O
kernel O
. O

The O
form O
factor O
is O
great O
and O
they O
are O
not O
lying O
about O
the O
battery O
life O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
how O
in O
the O
world O
it O
's O
going O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Reliability O
was O
the O
biggest O
problem O
. O

but O
this O
one O
is O
perfect O
I O
have O
a O
hp O
pavilion O
g6 O
and O
it O
fits O
perfectly O

and O
I O
have O
to O
walk O
up O
this O
gigantic O
hill O
to O
class O
everyday O
. O

Received O
functional O
. O

Download O
speed O
: O

It O
is O
completely O
playable O
at O
medium O
details O
. O

I O
had O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
, O
but O
this O
does O
not O
charge O
the O
battery O
on O
my O
Dell O
Inspiron O
1525 O
, O
so O
it O
must O
be O
plugged O
in O
at O
all O
times O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O
original O
adapter O
behind O
while O
travelling O
. O

It O
also O
boasts O
major O
cool O
factor O
colors O
, O
including O
red O
, O
blue O
and O
Black O
! O

External O
Optical O
Drive O

and O
I O
love O
the O
touch O
screen O
. O

It O
cut O
my O
charging O
time O
by O
more O
than O
a O
half O
. O

Great O
price O
! O
! O
! O

Overall O
I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
HD O
..... O

Highly O
recommend O
. O

No O
problems O
since O
. O

I O
am O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
putting O
it O
in O
the O
laptop O
! O

Trying O
to O
have O
basicly O
the O
same O
speed O
, O
and O
RAM O
. O

Under O
this O
evidence O
finally O
she O
stopped O
asking O
for O
information O
about O
the O
problem O

Why O
you O
ask O
, O
well O
if O
you O
turn O
the O
PC O
off O
and O
go O
to O
bed O
the O
GPS O
recognizes O
that O
it O
is O
pluged O
in O
and O
stays O
ON O
until O
its O
battery O
is O
dead O
. O

an O
ultrabook O
should O
be O
as O
thin O
as O
possible O
! O

I O
'd O
advise O
being O
patient O
and O
waiting O
to O
give O
the O
LiveScribe O
time O
to O
mature O
the O
software O
. O

so O
I O
've O
been O
using O
that O
exclusively O
. O

The O
remote O
control O
is O
not O
terribly O
useful O
due O
to O
poor O
range O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
satisfying O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

I O
agree O
the O
caselogics O
ones O
might O
be O
more O
sleek O
, O
but O
then O
hey O
, O
this O
bag O
is O
pretty O
sleek O
based O
off O
the O
design O
they O
gave O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
thought O
the O
flap O
will O
close O
and O
there O
will O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
zipper O
of O
velcro O
to O
keep O
it O
shut O
. O

I O
then O
tested O
the O
adapter O
with O
an O
Oyen O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
, O
2 O
. O

And O
16 O
GB O
memory O
in O
my O
tiny O
NUC O
makes O
that O
baby O
PURRRR O
! O

Also O
do O
not O
imagine O
you O
will O
be O
backpacking O
with O
it O
. O

I O
got O
the O
package O
in O
the O
right O
time O
as O
estimated O
. O

, O
size O
- O
keyboard O
not O
cut O
down O
to O
fit O
laptop O
, O
but O
feels O
just O
like O
typical O
desktop O
keyboards O
( O
very O
comfortable)-Dual O
cooler O
. O

no O
water O
bottle O
holder O
. O

Welp O
, O
it O
is O
cheap O
. O

I O
have O
runs O
about O
55 O
- O
60 O
Mbps O
download O
and O
6 O
- O
8 O
Mbps O
upload O
according O
to O
Cisco O
's O
own O
software O
, O
over O
standard O
Charter O
cable O
. O

It O
has O
sturdy O
clasps O
at O
the O
ends O
, O
with O
a O
nice O
shoulder O
pad O
, O
and O
is O
adjustable O
. O

I O
've O
reformatted O
these O
drives O
many O
times O
. O

Now O
my O
all O
of O
my O
friends O
can O
see O
my O
friendly O
face O
! O

When O
a O
review O
is O
written O
, O
it O
should O
use O
the O
following O
( O
or O
similar O
) O
standards;1 O
. O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
pixel O
issues O
or O
bleeding O
. O

and O
I O
hope O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
use O
it O
again O
but O
for O
the O
value O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
even O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
collect O
on O
the O
warranty O
. O

Until O
Apple O
fixes O
this O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
less O
graphics O
functionality O
than O
you O
had O
with O
previous O
generation O

You O
can O
safely O
carry O
three O
filters O
around O
. O

At O
one O
point O
I O
had O
to O
move O
the O
TiVo O
and O
the O
drive O
. O

One O
of O
the O
quietest O
fans O
as O
well O
. O

So O
, O
why O
the O
4 O
star O
rating O
? O

This O
is O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
me O
and O
does O
not O
take O
up O
much O
real O
estate O
on O
my O
small O
desk O
. O

If O
you O
expect O
lightening O
read O
- O
writes O
, O
you O
are O
not O
going O
to O
get O
it O
any O
faster O
than O
any O
USB O
attached O
drive O
. O

Works O
and O
fit O
into O
laptop O
great O
, O
now O
to O
replace O
the O
screen O
and O
a O
few O
other O
odds O
and O
ends O
and O
the O
machine O
should O
be O
peachy O
again O
. O

I O
am O
really O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
of O
this O
backpack O
. O

It O
arrived O
in O
a O
timely O
fashion O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
well O
made O
and O
fit O
perfectly O
. O

Compare O
with O
stands O
/ O
cases O
with O
keyboards O
, O
this O
is O
a O
much O
less O
expensive O
, O
lighter O
, O
and O
more O
flexible O
system O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
2nd O
dongle O
as O
well O
and O
the O
device O
ca O
nt O
keep O
any O
signal O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
the O
option O
to O
buy O
the O
older O
, O
better O
version O
. O

There O
is O
an O
external O
pocket O
that O
has O
a O
barely O
visible O
zipper O
. O

The O
nice O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
plug O
in O
and O
the O
station O
transmitter O
glows O
red O
when O
the O
car O
is O
on O
and O
since O
my O
dashboard O
is O
red O
led O
colored O
it O
compliments O
it O
nicely O
. O

It O
's O
no O
big O
deal O
, O
but O
the O
Dell O
case O
wins O
. O

It O
's O
fantastic O
other O
than O
the O
very O
difficult O
to O
use O
mousepad O
. O

This O
happened O
to O
be O
my O
first O
Anker O
purchase O
, O
I O
'm O
rather O
certain O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
the O
last O
. O

adapter O
I O
used O
prior O
to O
my O
Jabra O
. O

The O
M505 O
is O
very O
comfortable O
, O
has O
a O
slide O
- O
switch O
on O
bottom O
to O
make O
battery O
compartment O
easier O
to O
access O
, O
a O
low O
battery O
indicatoe O
LED O
on O
top O
, O
and O
the O
smallest O
USB O
receiver O
on O
the O
market O
. O

I O
had O
no O
issues O
pairing O
with O
my O
computer O
. O

8 O
GB O
even O
after O
reformatting O

Pretty O
hard O
to O
run O
an O
electronic O
device O
without O
power O
. O

This O
is O
so O
small O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
have O
bitten O
on O
it O
at O
this O
full O
price O
, O
but O
after O
using O
it O
I O
feel O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
it.-A O
bit O
on O
the O
heavy O
feeling O
side O
. O

I O
've O
never O
considered O
myself O
to O
have O
very O
large O
hands O

and O
it O
fits O
my O
printer O
absolutely O
perfectly O
without O
the O
single O
sheet O
feeder O
guide O
attached O
. O

3-Inch O
Laptop O
( O
Cobalt O
Blue O
Aluminum O
) O
. O

It O
is O
pretty O
light O
- O
weight O
for O
a O
bag O
this O
size O
. O

The O
cable O
is O
working O
well O
. O

She O
loves O
it O
, O
and O
after O
3 O
months O
it O
still O
spends O
every O
second O
on O
her O
Air O
. O

I O
will O
update O
if O
i O
find O
anything O
out O
. O

Its O
light O
and O
small O
netbook O
in O
comparision O
to O
my O
17 O
" O
notebook O
. O

The O
ONLY O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
other O
than O
the O
bending O
of O
the O
keyboard O
( O
which O
is O
n't O
a O
lot O
) O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
offline O
compatibility O
. O

I O
also O
added O
a O
scroll O
mouse O
, O
the O
touch O
pad O
was O
a O
bit O
clunky O
and O
the O
buttons O
did O
n't O
work O
the O
best O
. O

But O
, O
I O
think O
you O
'll O
feel O
better O
about O
purchasing O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
pay O
full O
retail O
. O

Connects O

The O
Vertex O
100 O
has O
a O
very O
good O
padded O
waist O
belt O
and O
the O
bag O
is O
long O
enough O
that O
the O
load O
can O
be O
supported O
in O
part O
by O
the O
hips O
on O
anyone O
of O
medium O
to O
small O
height O
- O
not O
going O
to O
work O
for O
someone O
6 O
' O
2 O
" O
for O
example O
. O

It O
does O
an O
awesome O
job O
and O
sounded O
to O
us O
like O
we O
were O
listing O
to O
an O
actual O
CD O
playing O
in O
the O
system O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
know O
what O
I O
like O
more O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
its O
really O
just O
a O
cisco O
product O
underneith O
or O
that O
it O
was O
manufactured O
by O
Asus O
. O

I O
was O
only O
getting O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
hours O
on O
the O
original O
. O

I O
booted O
the O
phone O
and O
connected O
it O
to O
my O
computer O
, O
and O
again O
to O
my O
pleasant O
surprise O
, O
the O
cable O
allowed O
me O
to O
retrieve O
my O
important O
files O
from O
the O
phone O
before O
it O
gets O
recycled O
. O

The O
manufacturers O
should O
be O
more O
conscious O
of O
people O
's O
sentiments O
before O
approving O
such O
designs O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
adapter O
was O
heating O
up O
more O
quickly O
than O
the O
laptop O
. O

So O
now O
i O
have O
purchased O
3 O
so O
far O
and O
will O
come O
back O
for O
more O
when O
needed O
. O

Does O
not O
" O
snap O
" O
into O
place O
quite O
as O
well O
as O
the O
stock O
cable O
end O
but O
the O
difference O
is O
minimal O
. O

If O
you O
do O
any O
picture O
editing O
and O
like O
making O
videos O
out O
of O
your O
pictures O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
the O
processor O
works O
well O
enough O
although O
rendering O
the O
pan O
and O
zoom O
features O
makes O
the O
playback O
a O
bit O
jerky O
. O

We O
bought O
this O
for O
a O
colleague O
who O
needed O
a O
replacement O
. O

Samsung O
seem O
to O
make O
things O
WORSE O
over O
time O
as O
they O
try O
and O
drop O
the O
price O
. O

As O
I O
wrote O
in O
a O
different O
review O
as O
to O
WHY O

Overall O
this O
headset O
is O
great O
. O

" O
for O
some O
reason O
that O
bugged O
me O
my O
pc O
laptop O
does O
not O
do O
that O
i O
beleive O
because O
of O
the O
thin O
size O
of O
this O
notebook O

I O
have O
an O
ASUS O
tablet O
, O
which O
I O
love O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
replace O
my O
old O
Compaq O
with O
this O
one O
. O

I O
love O
the O
concept O
of O
this O
and O
it O
works O
even O
after O
the O
ground O
prong O
broke O
off O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
LOVE O
it O
if O
the O
prong O
did O
n't O
break O
off O
in O
an O
outlet O
when O
I O
unplugged O
it O
. O

) O
maximum O

upgrade O
isCorsair O
8 O
GB O
( O
2x O
4 O
GB O
) O

It O
would O
make O
a O
delightful O
gift O
for O
a O
child O
or O
young O
teen O
. O

It O
was O
delivered O
quickly O
, O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
has O
been O
reliable O
. O

This O
Acer O
has O
a O
plastic O
body O
. O

The O
only O
deficiency O
that O
remains O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
short O
battery O
run O
time O
on O
a O
fully O
charged O
battery O
. O

The O
sound O
out O
of O
the O
speakers O
is O
very O
crisp O
, O
it O
is O
also O
pretty O
loud O
if O
need O
be O
. O

Only O
takes O
a O
second O
. O

When O
I O
first O
got O
the O
phone O
, O
the O
screen O
was O
damaged O
down O
one O
side O
with O
black O
lines O
in O
the O
screen O
itself O
, O
this O
then O
grew O
along O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
screen O
, O
and O
then O
miraculously O
healed O
itself O
. O

But O
still O
its O
about O
the O
only O
place O
to O
be O
able O
to O
store O
the O
stylus O
on O
the O
iPad O
besides O
maybe O
data O
jack.-it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
tip O
that O
was O
about O
as O
narrow O
as O
a O
pen O
, O
but O
that O
's O
just O
not O
possible O
on O
the O
iPad O
. O

This O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
crap O
. O

There O
was O
even O
a O
class O
action O
lawsuit O
over O
it O
( O
which O
is O
now O
closed O
, O
but O
if O
you O
google O
it O
, O
you O
'll O
find O
it O
) O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
manufacturer O
has O
provided O
exceptional O
support O
. O

These O
cons O
may O
not O
bother O
you O
, O
but O
be O
aware O
that O
you O
might O
get O
a O
vastly O
different O
messenger O
bag O
than O
that O
shown O
or O
presented O
on O
the O
product O
page O
. O

Have O
a O
few O
1 O
tb O
laptop O
drives O
and O
this O
case O
is O
the O
perfect O
match O
! O

Toshiba O
stands O
behind O
their O
products O
as O
I O
have O
bought O
from O
them O
before O
. O

I O
initially O
bought O
it O
for O
$ O
35 O

They O
must O
fill O
out O
form O
info O
on O
the O
caller O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
thing O
and O
installed O
it O
to O
my O
new O
gaming O
computer O

But O
it O
is O
under O
two O
- O
year O
warranty O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
, O
so O
they O
do O
have O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

I O
have O
not O
used O
it O
too O
much O
yet O

out.**update**not O
sure O
why O
but O
its O
worked O
fine O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

It O
was O
an O
excellent O
purchase O
for O
the O
money O
for O
the O
one O
that O
worked O
, O
so O
I O
give O
it O
3 O
stars O
( O
deducting O
2 O
for O
the O
one O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
) O
. O

On O
the O
road O
the O
combo O
of O
the O
iphone O
and O
chromebook O
gives O
me O
all O
the O
power O
and O
flexibility O
I O
need O
and O
with O
the O
remote O
desktop O

It O
allows O
me O
to O
use O
the O
feet O
while O
getting O
perfect O
ventilation O
. O

and O
i O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
price O
. O

Love O
all O
the O
pockets O
and O
organizers O
. O

This O
messenger O
bag O
has O
a O
huge O
capacity O
and O
is O
very O
light O
weight O
. O

I O
've O
never O
seen O
a O
laptop O
that O
you O
could O
n't O
turn O
off O
the O
bluetooth O
separately O
from O
the O
wi O
- O
fi O
. O

I O
really O
can O
not O
find O
any O
simple O
words O
to O
show O
my O
feeling O
to O
apple O
's O
design O
. O

But O
for O
the O
price O
what O
was O
I O
going O
to O
lose O
? O

It O
's O
the O
same O
product O
that O
you O
'd O
get O
in O
the O
more O
expensive O
packages O
and O
does O
the O
same O
job O
! O

so O
I O
have O
to O
ding O
the O
score O
. O

This O
soles O
my O
problem O
. O

When O
you O
are O
done O
putting O
dvd O
drive O
in O
make O
sure O
to O
secure O
it O
from O
back O
with O
2 O
small O
screws O
provided O
. O

The O
pin O
orientation O
of O
the O
connector O
end O
that O
fits O
the O
netbook O
's O
adapter O
is O
sometimes O
known O
as O
" O
mickey O
mouse O
" O
, O
as O
I O
suppose O
there O
is O
some O
likeness O
to O
the O
character O
. O

4GHz O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
cards O
in O
their O
portables O
. O

so O
I O
purchased O
a O
new O
one O
. O

You O
think O
that O
iHome O
could O
have O
found O
enough O
material O
to O
add O
one O
more O
inch O
in O
the O
Smart O
Sleeve O
. O

You O
need O
fast O
, O
WiFi O
connectivity O
to O
make O
it O
worth O
your O
while O
. O

If O
a O
solid O
- O
performing O
, O
ever O
- O
reliable O
online O
connections O
are O
high O
priorities O
, O
then O
the O
Toshiba O
is O
a O
standout O
. O

BETTER O
follow O
omgchrome O
's O
guide O
to O
add O
swap O
memory O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
manage O
about O
1 O
. O
5 O
times O
as O
many O
tabs O
. O

Could O
be O
much O
better O
- O
but O
my O
data O
plan O
is O
" O
pay O
as O
you O
go O
" O
, O
which O
I O
like O
a O
lot O
. O

Recently O
I O
purchased O
a O
' O
scratch O
n O
' O
dent O
' O
HP O
Chromebook O
14 O
" O
for O
my O
husband O
who O
has O
never O
made O
friends O
with O
Windows O
. O

I O
had O
a O
dell O
workstation O
w/ O
docking O
and O
the O
docking O
station O
was O
big O
, O
clunky O
to O
use O
, O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
connected O
till O
after O
the O
laptop O
was O
plugged O
in O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
looked O
pretty O
clean O
, O
the O

cleaner O
came O
off O
with O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
dust O
which O
was O
easily O
removed O
from O
the O
device O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
clear O
and O
crisp O
. O

This O
one O
WORKS O
.... O
so O
far O
. O

I O
have O
returned O
the O
item O
. O

It O
had O
too O
much O
distortion O
. O

Flashlighting O

None O
of O
the O
others O
really O
compare O
to O
this O
in O
terms O
of O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O
. O

Cons:*Travelers O
will O
find O
the O
headphones O
to O
be O
quite O
large O
, O
even O
when O
folded O
up.*If O
the O
noise O
cancelling O
is O
not O
turned O
on O
, O
the O
headphones O
sound O
terrible O
. O

This O
thing O
charges O
almost O
everything O

The O
top O
part O
of O
the O
case O
( O
on O
the O
lid O
) O
can O
stay O
on O
the O
Mac O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
full O
coverage O
, O
so O
decided O
to O
return O
this O
. O

No O
compatibility O
problems O
, O
size O
is O
correct O
and O
it O
fits O
properly O
. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
online O
help O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
did O
n't O
screw O
up O
my O
hard O
drive O
. O

The O
direction O
never O
mentioned O
this O

The O
bundled O
PCMCIA O
adapter O
for O
a O
laptop O
was O
up O
and O
running O
immedaitely O
on O
a O
Toshiba O
laptop O
.. O

This O
would O
be O
acceptable O
if O
it O
snapped O
in O
to O
place O
firmly O
, O
unfortunately O
it O
is O
easily O
dislodged O
, O
not O
to O
the O
point O
that O
it O
loses O
contact O

Wireless O
USB O
Adapter O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
yet O
used O
it O
for O
transferring O
media O
between O
the O
phone O
and O
computer O
- O
and O
actually O
do O
n't O
expect O
to O
- O
as O
that O
's O
not O
what O
I O
wanted O
it O
for O
. O

They O
work O
up O
to O
25 O
feet O
away O
. O

The O
right O
side O
has O
only O
the O
DVD O

. O

If O
you O
use O
Outlook O
( O
not O
Express O
) O
heavily O
, O
or O
use O
Powerpoint O
, O
Excel O
, O
and O
Word O
a O
lot O
and O
like O
XP O
, O
then O
the O
Mac O
is O
a O
snoozer O
. O

My O
desktop O
is O
more O
powerful O
, O
but O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
my O
games O
with O
me O
when O
I O
travel O
and O
even O
just O
when O
visiting O
friends O
and O
this O
laptop O
has O
done O
all O
of O
that O
for O
me O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
my O
phone O
and O
iPad O

After O
doing O
some O
research O
, O
I O
found O
that O
other O
people O
have O
the O
same O
noise O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
guessing O
its O
just O
normal O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

I O
'd O
say O
this O
is O
more O
of O
a O
" O
soft O
briefcase O
" O
than O
most O
laptop O
carrying O
cases O
. O

Just O
cut O
a O
piece O
long O
enough O
to O
cover O
the O
logo O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
replacement O
power O
adapter O
for O
my O
HP O
laptop O
. O

No O
refunds O
on O
those O
either O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
need O
the O
stripped O
screw O
to O
install O
the O
OWC O
bracket O
since O
it O
comes O
with O
its O
own O
screws O
. O

The O
speakers O
sound O
surprisingly O
good O
considering O
how O
thin O
and O
small O
the O
body O
is O
. O

Replaced O
my O
1 O
stick O
ram O
with O
this O
and O
have O
no O
problems O
. O

Those O
drives O
have O
the O
vent O
hole O
positioned O
in O
exactly O
a O
location O
that O
is O
COVERED O
by O
the O
swing O
door O
of O
the O

I O
solved O
this O
by O
also O
ordering O
a O
6 O
' O
usb O
cable O
extender O
. O

; O
-)This O
is O
not O
really O
a O
gripe O
, O
just O
a O
" O
heads O
up O
" O
: O
Heat O
! O

I O
'd O
prefer O
that O
the O
power O
cord O
be O
hardwired O
in O
, O
but O
this O
is O
ok O
. O

So O
it O
's O
fine O
for O
regular O
hard O
drives O
, O
but O
when O
I O
need O
to O
move O
data O
fast O
from O
my O
desktop O
SSD O
to O
carry O
with O
me O
to O
my O
portable O
SSD O
, O
this O
enclosure O
was O
definitely O
not O
the O
answer O
. O

To O
remedy O
this O
issue O
, O
you O
can O
deactivate O
the O
self O
adjusting O
screen O
lighting O
, O
or O
just O
slightly O
change O
the O
angle O
of O
your O
screen O
. O

Because O
I O
have O
it O
now O
my O
desktop O
gets O
to O
stay O
off O
more O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
some O
big O
adapter O
to O
charge O
my O
idevices O
, O
nor O
anything O
else O
that O
requires O
USB O
power O
. O

Although O
the O
adapter O
was O
advertised O
with O
the O
power O
cord O
, O
it O
was O
not O
delivered O
with O
one O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
packaging O
for O
this O
mouse O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
change O
about O
the O
Cooler O
Master O
is O
to O
have O
the O
power O
cord O
either O
in O
the O
center O
, O
or O
to O
be O
able O
to O
attach O
it O
on O
either O
end O
. O

If O
you O
need O
a O
RELIABLE O
laptop O
that O
works O
ever O
bit O
as O
fast O
as O
anything O
on O
the O
market O
with O
a O
great O
webcam O
for O
Skype O
, O
and O
great O
quality O
sound O
fo O
rmusic O
and O
movies O

It O
comes O
with O
a O
mini O
USB O
charging O
cable O
which O
is O
pretty O
useless O
to O
me O
since O
all O
my O
devices O
have O
a O
micro O
USB O
port O
, O
but O
I O
do O
nt O
care O
since O
I O
have O
my O
own O
cables O

For O
a O
carrying O
case O
, O
this O
will O
hold O
a O
lot O
of O
items O
that O
you O
need O
to O
bring O
along O
for O
your O
work O
day O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
the O
price O
since O
it O
is O
exquisitely O
made O
and O
quite O
solid O
. O

It O
not O
only O
worked O
flawlessly O
with O
WEP O
enabled O
, O
but O
it O
gave O
a O
stronger O
signal O
, O
and O
is O
about O
half O
the O
size O
of O
the O
WAP11 O
. O

You O
could O
carry O
it O
around O
in O
a O
large O
backpack O
, O
but O
for O
students O
a O
better O
plan O
would O
be O
to O
leave O
this O
one O
on O
your O
desk O
and O
carry O
a O
lighter O
, O
cheaper O
laptop O
in O
your O
bookbag O
. O

am O

in O
this O
bag O

notes O
app O
. O

, O
I O
'm O
pretty O
satisfied O
with O
it O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
this O
product O
works O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
boost O
the O
signal O
of O
your O
wireless O
network O
, O
live O
in O
an O
apartment O
or O
out O
in O
the O
open O
country O
, O
and O
have O
the O
patience O
to O
get O
it O
working O
. O

Would O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
as O
it O
is O
compact O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
recharge O
. O

When O
I O
gave O
my O
case O
number O
, O
there O
was O
silence O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
then O
I O
was O
asked O
if O
my O

was O
and O
Eee O

. O

: O
it O
wo O
n't O

have O
become O
a O
necessity O
. O

In O
conjunction O
with O
the O
Bluetooth O
GPS O
Android O
app O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work O

and O
I O
have O
been O
throughly O
impressed O
by O
the O
performance O

Bought O
this O

about O

overall O

, O
this O
device O
is O
completely O
useless O
in O
Linux O
as O
it O
does O
n't O
register O
as O
a O
Bluetooth O
device O
in O
any O
way O
whatsoever O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
U3 O
software O
and O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
password O
protect O
your O
data O
- O
which O
you O
'll O
need O
if O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
at O
greater O
risk O
for O
loss O
due O
to O
the O
aforementioned O
attachment O
issue O
. O

Everything O
works O
as O
it O
should O
, O
software O
installs O
and O
uninstalls O
without O
a O
hitch O
, O
and O
there O
does O
n't O
appear O
to O
be O
an O
overabundance O
of O
bloatware O
pre O

installed O
. O

The O
Bose O
QC O
headphones O
fit O
like O
a O
glove O
in O
the O
front O
pocket O
, O
and O
everything O
is O
easy O
to O
get O
at O
once O
on O
the O
plane O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
, O
and O
it O
has O
tons O
of O
RAM O
and O
hard O
drive O
space O
. O

I O
notice O
that O
quite O
a O
few O
Amazon O
reviewers O
like O
to O
end O
their O
review O
by O
saying O
" O
All O
in O
all O
" O
or O
" O
Overall O
. O
. O
. O
" O

Do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
buy O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
navigating O
menus O
with O
SLR O
cameras O
, O
this O
should O
be O
a O
cakewalk O
. O

I O
was O
blown O
away O
by O
this O
speaker O
dock O
. O

It O
took O
me O
about O
2 O
days O
to O
put O
a O
scratch O
on O
my O
new O
MacBook O
. O

pro O
perfectly O
. O

I O
called O
CineRAID O
's O
tech O
support O
and O
received O
a O
call O
back O
within O
fifteen O
minutes O
( O
very O
impressed O
) O
and O
spoke O
to O
someone O
who O
said O
that O
I O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
hear O
the O
fan O
over O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
drives O
. O

There O
is O
already O
a O
crack O
in O
the O
plastic O
, O
used O
it O
only O
once O
, O
and O
orginally O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
scratch O
. O

I O
had O
a O
Mini O
to O
DVI O
previously O
but O
it O
would O
not O
work O
with O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Air O
. O

The O
thing O
is O
, O
when O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
big O
and O
powerful O
truck O
, O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
dumb O
to O
criticize O
it O
for O
being O
hard O
to O
park O
. O

so O
I O
can O
hook O
it O
up O
to O
a O
monitor O
for O
movies O
and O
TV O
shows O
. O

At O
normal O
viewing O
distance O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
out O
pixels O
like O
you O
can O
on O
a O
1920x1080 O
or O
1920x1200 O
monitor O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
weight O
of O
your O
computer O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
be O
very O
discerning O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

Cons O
: O
Fan O
is O
louder O
than O
Asus O
G O
series O
, O
Warranty O
Void O
sticker O
on O
expansion O
bays O
, O
touchpad O
is O

, O
that O
s O
the O
one O
that O
goes O
with O
me O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

It O
's O
a O
huge O
touchpad O
, O
nicely O
placed O
, O
and O
could O
have O
been O
perfect O
if O
they O
had O
used O
an O
Elan O
pad O
or O
even O
a O
Synaptics O
pad O
. O

I O
ve O
tried O
installing O
Windows O
7 O
and O
Ubuntu O
, O
both O
show O
horrible O
CPU O
/ O
video O
performance O
. O

so O
I O
can O
copy O
one O
to O
another O
without O
changing O
discs O
. O

Unfortunately O
it O
took O
me O
about O
3 O
to O
4 O
hours O
with O
all O
the O
troubleshooting O
to O
get O
the O
answer O
. O

Bought O
this O
to O
connect O
my O
thumbdrive O
mp3 O
player O
to O
my O
milwaukee O
v28 O
radio O
. O

What O
I O
recommend O
over O
this O
case O
? O

Have O
used O
Corsair O
memory O
in O
two O
other O
PC O
's O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

after O
I O
realized O
this O
is O
not O
a O
booster O
, O
just O
a O
wireless O
remote O
, O

Now O
both O
of O
them O
have O
good O
padding O
for O
a O
slim O
sleeve O
and O
good O
strap O
but O
no O
padding O
for O
the O
strap O
so O
long O
term O
use O
will O
be O
tough O
on O
your O
shoulder O
. O

When O
hitting O
the O
range O
, O
I O
can O
quickly O
just O
pull O
out O
my O
laptop O
or O
some O
of O
the O
other O
junk O
the O
main O
compartment O
and O
slip O
in O
my O
pistol O
case O
, O

protection O
, O
glasses O
and O
ammo O
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
a O
unibody O
design O
that O
is O
cut O
from O
a O
solid O
piece O
of O
aluminum O
. O

so O
I O
decided O
I O
may O
as O
well O
continue O
the O
trend O
with O
this O
one O
. O

Very O
Nice O
looking O
case O
. O

Requires O
a O
mike O
stand O
and O
lots O
of O
snapping O
parts O
together O
to O
assemble O
the O
first O
time O
. O

i O
am O
now O
waiting O
for O
this O
tray O
, O
so O
I O
can O
use O
the O
included O
HDD O
as O
external O
on O
USB O

0 O
, O
It O
's O
supposed O
to O

I O
bought O
this O
memory O
card O
so O
that O
a O
friend O
would O
have O
a O
memory O
car O
to O
go O
with O
the O
camera O
that O
I O
sold O
to O
her O
. O

No O
complaints O
whatsoever O
here O
. O

HP O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
themselves O
offering O
up O
such O
a O
staff O
of O
idiots O
. O

As O
you O
do O
this O
maintain O
counter O
tension O
on O
the O
free O
edge O
of O
the O
film O
and O
firm O
consistent O
forward O
& O
down O
pressure O
with O
the O
PVC O
pipe O
. O

and O
I O
told O
my O
colleagues O
that O
I O
wanted O
this O
for O
the O
holidays O
, O
and O
when O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
loved O
it O

I O
am O
not O
someone O
who O

It O
's O

how O
HP O
will O
shoot O

putting O
so O
much O

Of O
course O
, O
the O

is O
somewhat O

and O
certainly O
not O
meant O

plan O
on O
connecting O
your O

you O

ThoughtsThe O
reason O
why O

The O

all O
the O
things O
I O
need O
for O
a O

its O
battery O
life O
is O
amazing O
! O

I O
have O
installed O
those O
throughout O
the O
house O
, O
so O

Just O
wanted O
a O
little O
more O
protection O
for O
my O
computer O
since O
my O
kids O
use O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
've O
been O
reading O
of O
other O
Netbook O
manufacturers O
beginning O
to O
sell O
10 O

with O
a O
more O
comfortable O
1366x768 O

.... O

First O
of O
all O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
price O
, O
I O
was O
expecting O
to O
pay O
much O
more O
than O
I O
did O
. O

The O
price O
on O
this O
battery O
is O
also O
much O
less O
than O
the O
replacement O
batteries O
you O
can O
purchase O
directly O
from O
Dell O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
router O
to O
be O
able O
to O
stream O
netflix O
to O
my O
living O
room O
( O
20 O
feet O
away O
) O
without O
it O
buffering O
and O
the O

quality O
being O
poor O

which O
is O
pretty O

I O
Turned O
this O

back O
on O

now O
it O
's O
fine O
. O

The O

I O
do O

how O
I O

The O
display O
is O
amazing O
, O
the O
back O
light O
keyboard O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

The O
i5 O
processor O
and O
Windows O

is O
a O
good O
match O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
manufactures O
have O
moved O
all O
the O
ports O
to O
the O
left O
and O
right O
sides O
of O
laptops O
, O
but O
Acer O
pushed O
them O
to O
the O
rear O
side O
like O
the O
good O
old O
days O
. O

This O
is O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
my O
writing O
this O
review O
. O

The O
stand O
feels O
sturdy O
too O
. O

This O
is O
now O
going O
to O
be O
my O
little O
workhorse O
computer O
. O

I O
end O
up O
using O
the O
inner O
compartment O
for O
stuff O
like O
USB O
cords O
and O
the O
sort O
that O
can O
be O
arranged O
in O
a O
some O
- O
what O
flat O
manner O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
keyboard O
. O

so O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
see O
wires O
, O
but O
still O
have O
quick O
access O
to O
the O
two O
additional O
ports O
in O
the O
front O
for O
quick O
tasks O
like O
plugging O
in O
the O
USB O
flash O
drive O
. O

It O
probably O
is O
n't O
the O
cheapest O
solution O
for O
my O
situation O
, O
however O
. O

To O
set O
the O
computer O
was O
a O
real O
breeze O
and O
immediately O
i O
found O
the O
same O
bookmarks O
and O
application O
I O
have O
on O
chromebox O
. O

Ok O
, O
yes O
it O
does O
slightly O
darken O
the O
screen O
but O
it O
does O
not O
make O
your O
laptop O
unusable O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
for O
me O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
do O
not O
like O
Android O
ANYTHING O
because O
that O
system O
is O
flat O
- O
out O
an O
ILLUSION O
of O
having O
a O
full O
computer O
. O

The O

comes O
with O
a O

over O

since O
I O

it O

Works O
great O

as O
well O
as O

, O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
other O
comes O
with O
a O
nice O
long O
cable O
and O
is O
weather O
proofed O
and O
mast O
ready O
, O
so O
you O
still O
have O
to O
add O
some O
to O
this O
.. O

Apple O
is O
renowned O
for O
its O
trackpads O
and O
this O
is O
no O
exceptions O
. O

The O
receiver O
beeps O
very O
loudly O
, O
easily O
enough O
to O
be O
heard O
under O
a O
pile O
of O
blankets O
. O

Strong O
radio O
stations O
will O
overwhelm O
the O
Tunecast O

and O
decrease O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
you O
hear O
. O

Thinking O
I O
may O
have O
bought O
the O
wrong O
PSU O
, O
it O
took O
a O
while O
for O
me O
to O
realize O
one O
of O
the O
6 O
block O
cables O
is O
actually O
a O
4 O
block O
and O
a O
2 O
block O
clipped O
together O
with O
tiny O
black O
plastic O
clips O
which O
are O
VERY O
difficult O
to O
see O
. O

less O
functional!)Cons:-The O
6-cell O
battery O
is O
larger O
and O
does O
not O
sit O
flush O
with O
laptop O
case O
so O
it O
makes O
the O
laptop O
sit O
at O
an O
angle O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
travel O
with O
this O
laptop O
much O

I O
think O
most O
of O
the O
bad O
reviews O
revolve O
around O
the O
confusing O
way O
this O
thing O
turns O
on O
and O
off O
. O

There O
was O
too O
much O
play O
in O
the O
plug O
which O
caused O
the O
connection O
to O
be O
intermittent O
. O

I O
make O
use O
of O
external O
harddrives O
( O
and O
the O
cloud O
) O
as O
it O
is O
, O
both O
for O
convenience O
and O
archival O
/ O
redundancy O
purposes O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
anticipate O
having O
any O
real O
space O
constraint O
. O

I O
used O
the O
battery O
right O
away O

Easy O

my O

, O
and O
assorted O

and O

, O
and O
having O
them O
in O
this O
pocket O
keeps O
them O
from O
ending O
up O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bag O
with O
everything O
else O
on O
top O
of O
them O
. O

Currently O
have O
to O
use O
my O
laptop O
which O
provides O
a O
max O
of O
500mAh.*Only O
allows O
for O

. O

As O
usual O
case O
logic O
brings O
great O
quality O

price O
relation O
. O

We O
still O
have O
to O
sign O
back O
in O
after O
a O
timeout O

Once O
you O
upgrade O
the O

how O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
anything O
more O
for O
the O
money O
? O

Sadly O
, O
this O

did O

handle O

I O
was O

for O
( O

but O
just O
a O

the O

is O
good O

A O
weak O
cell O

is O
a O
common O
problem O
with O
concrete O
and O
metal O
buildings O
shielding O
those O
signals O
out O
. O

Few O
flaws O
I O
've O
found O
. O

There O
are O
four O
ports O
on O
the O
hub O
, O
but O
three O
of O
them O
are O
a O
bit O
close O
together O
, O
which O
is O
normally O
not O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
still O
something O
to O
consider O
when O
purchasing O
. O

I O
continually O
experienced O
jammed O
CDs O
, O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
mechanical O
ejector O
is O
a O
major O
negative O
. O

there O

( O
again O
, O
I O
expected O
this O
thougH O
) O

. O

Really O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

The O

release O
and O
unreleased O
by O
a O
simple O
twist O
turn O
on O
the O
rubber O
knobs O
though O
the O
legs O
do O
n't O
slide O
out O
all O
that O
readily O
. O

Finally O
I O
purchased O
one O
for O
my O
teenage O
son O
for O
Christmas O
. O

I O
was O
at O
work O
when O
I O
received O
the O
package O
and O
several O
colleagues O
who O
were O
near O
had O
some O
very O
creative O
things O
to O
tell O
me O
once O
they O
saw O
the O
colorful O
strap O
. O

I O
would O
now O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
based O
on O
the O
product O
and O
support O
provided O
! O

and O
it O
locked O
right O
in O
. O

The O
widescreen O
HD O
is O
great O
and O
really O
improves O
the O
quality O
of O
calls O
on O
Skype O
tremendously O
. O

No O
additional O
pockets O
or O
anything O
, O
just O
a O
sleeve O
for O
it O
with O
some O
padding O
, O
but O
that O
was O
all O
we O
wanted O
. O

But O
great O
for O
daily O
use O
browsing O
, O
email O
, O
desktop O
apps O
, O
many O
games O
, O
chat O
/ O
skype O
etc O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
afraid O
that O
the O
zipper O
will O
scratch O
and O
wear O
down O
the O
corners O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
solid O
( O
around O
5 O
hours O
using O
a O
slightly O
dimmed O

) O
and O
the O
thing O
boots O
quickly O
. O

let O
me O

you O
that O

it O

just O
say O
tech O

sucks O

is O
near O

This O
would O
have O
saved O
the O
day O
many O

in O

It O
is O
more O
powerful O
than O
the O
original O

at O
a O
very O
reasonable O

The O

hold O

the O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
better O

the O

Unfortunately O
, O
when O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Apple O
site O
to O
review O
and O
price O
their O
batteries O
, O
the O

were O
very O
poor O

no O
better O
, O
if O
not O
worse O

than O
the O

on O
the O

If O

for O

I O
bought O
this O
battery O
in O
mid O
- O
Oct O
2013 O
for O
my O
Dell O
D630 O
laptop O
. O

The O
zippered O
compartment O
in O
the O
front O
is O
big O
enough O
for O
my O
external O
drive O
, O
my O
multicard O
reader O
, O
minimouse O
, O
charger O
, O
and O
little O
SD O
cards O
if O
I O
desire O
. O

There O
is O
one O
, O
more O
expensive O
, O
that O
will O
fit O
and O
screws O
will O
align O
and O
fit O
as O
well O
. O

Also O
I O
usually O
just O
pull O
the O
flash O
drive O
out O
without O
going O
through O
the O
" O
safely O
remove O
" O
steps O
and O
have O
NEVER O
lost O
data O
. O

I O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
any O
other O
device O
in O
the O
house O

, O
I O
love O
to O
carry O
my O
tripod O

The O
plastic O
is O
thinner O
than O
you O
would O
believe O
. O

It O
fits O
my O
15/12&#34 O
; O
lap O
top O
perfectly O
. O

If O
I O
press O
the O
built O
- O
in O
indicator O
on O
the O
battery O
, O
it O
shows O
no O
illuminated O
LEDs O
. O

Great O
screen O
, O
moderately O
fast O
browser O
and O
all O
software O
working O
well O
. O

An O
unintentional O
child O
proof O
feature.-Mouse O
pad O

Practical O
, O
attractive O
, O
and O
a O
great O
conversation O
- O
starter O
. O

I O
would O
have O
never O
believed O
it O
was O
possible O
since O
my O
original O
6-cell O
battery O
barely O
made O
it O
past O
an O
hour O
... O

and O
I O
'm O
hoping O
it O
stays O
this O
way O
. O

You O
never O
know O
what O
you O
'll O
get O
when O
you O
buy O

I O
strongly O
advice O
using O
MacBook O
on O
a O
open O
bottom O
surface O
, O
such O
as O
laptop O
stand O
with O
an O
open O
bottom O
surface O
area O
for O
ventilation O
, O
when O
using O
Vista O
. O

I O
recently O
got O
a O
macbook O
pro O
13 O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
take O
to O
plane O
trips O
to O
clients O
. O

So O
much O
for O
the O
newest O
version O
. O

Horrible O
, O
it O
never O
held O
a O
charge O
from O
day O
1 O
! O

it O
's O
no O
problem O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
drives O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
nightmare O
. O

This O
one O
does O
n't O
and O
is O
nicer O
. O

have O
iTunes O
installed O
, O
few O
games O
, O
and O
also O
connect O
my O
Nike+ O
watch O
amongst O
other O
things O
) O

I O
had O
not O
asked O
them O
to O
do O
this O
, O
as O
it O
was O
my O
error O
. O

Bass O
is O
tighter O
& O
features O
clean O
decay O
; O
it O
feels O
like O
going O
from O
a O
ported O
to O
a O
sealed O
- O
enclosure O
sub O
. O

If O
you O
are O
used O
to O
a O
larger O
screen O
, O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
to O
look O
at O
one O
in O
person O
and O
surf O
the O
web O
a O
bit O
to O
see O
if O
you O
can O
live O
with O
it O
. O

I O
've O
gotten O
compliment O
after O
complament O
on O
this O
back O
pack O
. O

Maybe O
this O
company O
should O
make O
custom O
covers O
for O
laptops O
. O

It O
works O
just O
fine O
that O
way O
( O
despite O
having O
to O
learn O
things O
like O
going O
to O
upper O
right O
to O
power O
down O
or O
find O
start O
menu O
instead O
of O
lower O
left O
) O
. O

Quality O
is O
decent O

Love O
that O
it O
has O
Windows O
7 O

Dell O
Inspiron O
and O
all O
of O
its O
accessories O
fit O
nicely O
into O
this O
more O
- O
than O
- O
adequate O
carrier O
. O

If O
you O
ignore O
the O
idiots O
rating O
this O
item O
poorly O
on O
Amazon O
( O
how O
about O

so O
I O
can O
remotely O
access O
my O

, O
but O
since O

was O
a O

slow O

I O
checked O
about O

, O
it O

been O

persistent O

I O

there O
are O
enough O

the O
things O

use O
with O
my O

I O
barely O
hear O

It O
would O
be O
cool O
to O

able O
to O
run O

it O
wo O
nt O
- O
again O
, O
it O

not O
meant O
to O
be O
an O
Android O

is O
great O

Do O
n't O
believe O
their O
numbers O
about O
it O
lasting O
for O
4 O
hours O
, O
as O
in O
real O
life O
use O
( O
somewhat O
conservative O

running O

You O
get O

Other O
than O

Anyone O
considering O
buying O
this O
bag O
should O
test O
fit O
their O
equipment O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
bag O
can O
be O
returned O
before O
buying O
. O

just O
feel O
stupid O
with O
it O
in O
the O
back O
. O

Many O
people O
say O
that O
you O
should O
get O
this O
device O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
computers O
for O
everybody O
to O
use O
AIM O
. O

Caselogic O
nailed O
it O
again O

Just O
has O
never O
made O
sense O
to O
me O
have O
a O
bag O
any O
taller O
/ O
wider O
than O
the O

and O

. O

( O
I O
've O
never O
liked O
the O
glossy O
screen O
my O
MacBook O
came O
with O
and O
wish O
I O
'd O
paid O
extra O
for O
the O
traditional O
matte O
screen O
) O
. O

Good O
job O
on O
this O
one O
. O

( O
They O
have O
one O
built O
in O
) O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
frequently O
uses O
multiple O
computers O
( O
i. O
e. O
students O
) O
or O
needs O
to O
move O
files O
across O
operating O
systems O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
product O
for O
two O
reasons O
: O
1 O
) O
one O
of O
my O
kids O
pulled O
my O
original O
charging O
cord O
out O
by O
the O
cord O
and O
it O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
head O
and O
2 O
) O
I O
use O
my O
tablet O
a O
lot O
and O
wanted O
a O
cord O
that O
would O
reach O
from O
my O
power O
strip O
on O
the O
floor O
to O
where O
I O
sit O
on O
the O
couch O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
very O
small O
to O
carry O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

Adding O
Users O
is O
as O
simple O
as O
clicking O
a O
new O
account O
button O
, O
typing O
in O
their O
name O
and O
a O
password O
. O

If O
Cisco O
Connect O
decides O
it O
can O
not O
talk O
to O
the O
router O
( O
which O
is O
frequent O
if O
you O
change O
the O
router O
's O
configuration O
via O
the O
Web O
interface O
) O
, O
then O
you O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
router O
to O
factory O
defaults O
and O
then O
restart O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
zippers O
and O
teeth O
get O
caught O
when O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
close O
the O
laptop O
. O

so O
it O
pops O
right O
out O
. O

while O
there O
is O
the O
occasional O
hiccup O
where O
it O
does O
n't O
register O
the O
second O
finger O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
minor O
thing O
and O
does O
n't O
happen O
often O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
one O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
my O
laptop O
, O
I O
replaced O
the O
memory O
and O
it O
works O
great O
! O

I O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
start O
reading O
the O
classics O
like O
" O
Treasure O
Island O
" O
but O
I O
am O
. O

I O
appreciate O
this O
because O
i O
d O
does O
n't O
feel O
dainty O
, O
and O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
grip O
on O
it O
and O
use O
the O
functions O
. O

The O
previous O
battery O
was O
completely O
dead O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
did O
so O
much O
research O
on O
this O
little O
item O
before O
buying O
it O
, O
when O
it O
arrived O
it O
was O
an O
utter O
disappointment O
. O

I O
was O
also O
interested O
in O
the O
120hz O
model O
, O
but O
chose O
this O
model O
as O
it O
was O
$ O
400 O
- O
500 O
less O
. O

and O
I O
sometimes O
transport O
my O
dock O
between O
work O
and O
home O
depending O
on O
the O
week O
that O
's O
ahead O
. O

The O
120hz O
automotion O
plus O
makes O
HD O
movie O
viewing O
100 O
times O
more O
enjoyable O
and O
is O
so O
chrystal O
clear O
. O

Matte O
finish O
looks O
good O
and O
dedicated O
number O
pad O
is O
perfect O
for O
those O
working O
with O
numbers O
. O

the O
audio O
is O
clear O
, O
the O
cam O
is O
clear O
--- O
except O
for O
tech O
problems O
related O
to O
the O
I O
- O
net----NOT O
the O
web O
- O
cam O
. O

and O
I O
use O
this O
cord O
to O
transfer O
them O
to O
my O
Kindle O
. O

I O
picked O
this O
enclosure O
up O
expecting O
it O
to O
not O
work O
for O
my O
BluRay O
drive O
( O
or O
only O
recognize O
it O
as O
a O
DVD O
- O
ROM O
) O
. O

The O
ends O
are O
reinforced O
and O
feels O
very O
very O
sturdy O
. O

At O
least O
in O
the O
frustration O
department O
. O

On O
the O
surface O
of O
this O
are O
six O
sections O
of O
varying O
size:2 O
sections O

Build O
quality O
is O
very O
good O
. O

Read O
on O
: O
LOOK O
& O
FEEL O
: O
The O
case O
looks O
alright O
, O
not O
much O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

I O
formatted O
the O
card O
and O
stored O
more O
pictures O
and O
videos O
( O
for O
my O
phone O
) O
and O
then O
it O
stopped O
working O
again O
. O

AND O
ta O
da O
. O

It O
really O
is O
very O
handy O
to O
have O
a O
little O
and O
very O
lightweight O
computer O
like O
this O
. O

6 O
Laptop O
and O
this O
sleeve O
works O
fine O
, O
snug O
as O
a O
bug O
in O
a O
rug O
. O

They O
hold O
the O
batteries O
secure O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
Asus O
Eee O
for O
three O
days O
and O
have O
used O
it O
for O
probably O
12 O
hours O
or O
so O
. O

While O
it O
's O
true O
that O
someone O
sitting O
next O
to O
you O
on O
a O
plane O
would O
have O
difficulty O
seeing O
your O
screen O
, O
it O
's O
not O
hidden O
from O
people O
sitting O
behind O
you O
or O
people O
walking O
down O
the O
aisle O
, O
etc O
. O

Nothing O
exciting O
, O
but O
it O
's O
useful O
. O

Then O
I O
found O
this O
, O
an O
exact O
replica O
of O
hers O
. O

Lower O
quality O
music O
can O
be O
detected O
more O
easily O
with O
these O
. O

Tried O
to O
charge O
it O
one O
day O
and O
it O
would O
n't O
charge O
. O

so O
I O
could O
n't O
use O
it O
with O
a O
portable O
power O
source O
. O

It O
remembers O
the O
connection O
from O
then O
on O
unless O
you O
pair O
the O
keyboard O
with O
another O
device O
. O

The O
space O
- O
age O
Coffee O
Cup O
design O
is O
contemporary O
, O
but O
not O
entirely O
attractive O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
connect O
with O
the O
screen O
very O
well O
. O

If O
you O
can O
deal O
with O
this O
then O
go O
for O
it O
, O
otherwise O
, O
choose O
another O
battery O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
LED O
TVs O
are O
replacing O
LCD O
TVs O
due O
to O
the O
advantages O
they O
offer O
. O

I O
love O
the O
zoom O
feature O
in O
Mac O
( O
i O
have O
vision O
problems O
looking O
@ O
small O
fonts O
. O

A O
matte O
surface O
like O
sony O
's O
will O
be O
perfect O
. O

The O
device O
connects O
itself O
and O
displays O
a O
strong O
signal O
status O
on O
a O
device O
management O
page O
and O
has O
all O
the O
links O
for O
self O
provisioning O
online O
, O
then O
it O
becomes O
a O
nightmare O
. O

Exactly O
what O
I O
needed O
. O

I O
still O
have O
n't O
figured O
it O
out O
, O
and O
am O
about O
halfway O
to O
wanting O
to O
just O
cut O
it O
off O
the O
case O
. O

REPEAT O
, O
HAALI O
codecs O
are O
not O
compatible O
up O
the O
video O
editor O
. O

Ter O
- O
ri O
- O
ble O
. O

It O
supposed O
to O
be O
functional O
, O
but O
the O
backlit O
keyboard O
and O
several O
function O
keys O
are O
apparently O
not O
working O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
in O
an O
office O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
play O
many O
games O
- O
so O

Charge O
time O
for O
going O
from O
dead O
battery O
to O
100 O
% O
is O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
3 O
hours O
, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
worse O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be O
. O

As O
usual O
, O
Amazon O
gave O
me O
an O
immediate O
refund O
. O

I O
have O
not O
heard O
of O
Kinivo O
before O
buying O
this O
product O
, O
but O
the O
sound O
is O
incredible O
from O
such O
a O
small O
form O
factor O
speaker O
. O

HP O
engineers O
also O
elected O
to O
use O
a O
single O
heat O
sink O
to O
cool O
both O
the O
GPU O
and O
the O
CPU O
. O

Diagonals O
are O
possible O
also O
. O

Fast O
shipping O
. O

Dual O
Display O
Universal O
Docking O
Station O
. O

I O
took O
my O
chances O
and O
am O
pleased O
to O
say O
this O
battery O
is O
great O
. O

I O
still O
will O
give O
it O
a O
5star O
because O
it O
is O
a O
direct O
competitor O
for O
the O
Microsoft O
Xbox O
360 O
brand O
network O
adapter O
's O
pricing O
, O
will O
guarantee O
you O
wo O
nt O
find O
any O
better O
on O
the O
market O
so O
far O
. O

- O
Your O
computer O
will O
go O
in O
an O
inside O
pocket O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
pack O
. O

but O
it O
's O
the O
only O
game O
in O
town O
at O
this O
point O

It O
's O
quite O
larger O
than O
the O
area O
of O
an O
iTouch O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
'm O
quite O
happy O
with O
the O
pen O
functions O
of O
the O
tablet O
, O
it O
works O
well O
for O
art O
and O
graphics O
and O
really O
opened O
up O
new O
areas O
for O
me O
( O
a O
non O
- O
artist O
) O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
absolutely O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
picture O
with O
gaming O
on O
this O
TV O
, O
especially O
the O
360 O
. O

& O
lt;--- O
confused O
me O
a O
few O
times O
there O
! O

we O
have O
purchased O
3 O
of O
these O
for O
our O
children O
and O
they O
are O
just O
great O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
so O
that O
I O
could O
use O
both O
my O
light O
up O
water O
speakers O
and O
generic O
computer O
speakers O
( O
w O
/ O
sub O
) O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
tablet O
for O
just O
over O
2 O
years O
now O
, O
and O
I O
consider O
it O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
I O
purchased O
in O
helping O
me O
to O
learn O
to O
draw O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
computer O
, O
phone O
, O
ipad O
, O
cords O
, O
chargers O
, O
and O
even O
a O
few O
magazines O
stuffed O
in O
this O
thing O
, O
and O
it O
's O
very O
comfortable O
to O
wear O
over O
my O
shoulder O
and O
carry O
to O
work O
and O
other O
places O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
Nabi O
2 O
a O
little O
over O
a O
month O
now O
and O
my O
family O
really O
enjoys O
it O
. O

and O
I O
can O
always O
find O
a O
place O
to O
set O
it O
down O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
stop O
the O
charging O
at O
~92 O
% O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
time O
with O
this O
setting O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
works O
fine O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O
many O
applications O
that O
might O
need O
a O
long O
cable O
. O

This O
enables O
users O
to O
video O
chat O
. O

They O
were O
recessed O
into O
the O
micro O
- O
usb O
connector O
, O
so O
whenever O
it O
was O
clipped O
into O
something O
, O
the O
cable O
would O
fall O
out O
as O
the O
two O
metal O
clips O
held O
it O
in O
place O
until O
pulled O
. O

You O
can O
point O
to O
specs O
and O
bench O
- O
marking O
data O
to O
define O
those O
things O
that O
are O
not O
perceivable O
to O
the O
naked O
eye O
if O
you O
want O
to O
, O
but O
I O
am O
certain O
that O
most O
folks O
will O
never O
see O
or O
feel O
the O
difference O
. O

Particularly O
, O
loss O
or O
rubber O
feet O
( O
always O
catches O
you O
by O
surprise O
) O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
buying O
aMoshi O
iVisor O
XT O
Screen O
Protection O
for O
iPad O
( O
Clear O
) O
, O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
superior O
to O
the O
Zagg O
InvisibleShield O
. O

There O
is O
an O
on O
- O
off O
switch O
on O
the O
side O
and O
a O
blue O
LED O
underneath O
that O
shows O
it O
's O
working O
. O

You O
get O
roughly O
3 O
hours O
of O
battery O
time O
from O
the O
standard O
battery O
if O
you O
do O
standard O
word O
, O
outlook O
, O
powerpoint O
work O
. O

I O
unplugged O
my O
laptop O
, O
took O
out O
the O
battery O
, O
popped O
cover O
off O
, O
inserted O
memory O
, O
snapped O
it O
into O
place O
. O

Its O
not O
like O
I O
wasted O
money O
on O
this O
cordless O
mouse O
as O
I O
now O
use O
it O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
monitor O
a O
couple O
years O
ago O
for O
competitive O
gaming O
and O
it O
has O
served O
me O
well O
. O

, O
it O
makes O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
and O
is O
perfect O
for O
working O
with O
your O
laptop O

I O
called O
Customer O
Services O
regarding O
the O
missing O
built O
- O
in O
WebCam O
and O
she O
said O
I O
could O
accept O
the O
20usd O
coupon O
or O
return O
the O
laptop O
for O
a O
refund O
, O
and O
nothing O
else O
Amazon O
could O
do O
. O

This O
plays O
all O
my O
AVI O
format O
TV O
shows O
and O
movies O
, O
plus O
You O
tube O
plays O
without O
the O
stutters O
that O
are O
normal O
on O
most O
other O
net O
books O
. O

After O
very O
little O
use O
the O
power O
button O
to O
the O
bag O
stopped O
working O
which O
ruined O
the O
charging O
part O
. O

I O
eventually O
disconnect O
the O
Phone O
and O
use O
only O
a O
900MHz O
one O
. O

You O
might O
be O
okay O
with O
them O
, O
though O
; O
my O
shoulders O
got O
ripped O
up O
in O
the O
Army O
, O
so O
they O
're O
more O
sensitive O
to O

. O

Has O
Velcro O

And O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
you O
do O
need O
to O
look O
at O
the O
instructions O
. O

We O
are O
very O
disappointed O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
this O

and O
are O
returning O
it O

I O
was O
cursing O
this O
thing O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
a O
huge O
joke O
as O
nothing O
was O
working O
right O

( O

) O
and O
the O
charge O
lasts O
much O
longer O
than O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
can O
not O
use O
the O
3 O
foot O
cable O
that O
came O
with O
my O
tablet O

use O
the O

this O

for O

the O

Caution:- O

Customer O

this O
bad O
is O

stuff O

Lo O
and O
behold O
it O
's O
secure O
and O
in O
" O
n O
" O
status O
. O

Does O
the O
job O
fine O
! O

and O
I O
just O
like O
it O
's O
protection O
for O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

The O
new O
black O
backlit O
keys O
are O
MUCH O
easier O
to O
see O
and O
feel O
great O
! O

I O
gess O
or O
consumes O
almost O
no O
energy O
while O
not O
used O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
got O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
connected O
to O
my O
TV O
via O
Miracast O
now O
, O
and O
it O
's O
pretty O
cool O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
this O
to O
use O
in O
your O
lap O
. O

About O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
seen O
would O
be O
a O
worldclock O
input O
for O
synchronizing O
analog O
recordings O
to O
digital O
cameras O
, O
but O
the O
size O
of O
the O
bnc O
connector O
would O
have O
nixed O
that O
option O
in O
this O
handheld O
product O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
over O
- O
heating O
, O
though O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
a O
beautiful O
bag O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

I O
actually O
prefer O
it O
to O
the O
mighty O
mouse O
. O

The O
big O
benefits O
of O
this O
particular O
Android O
model O
is O
that O
it O
has O
external O
ports O
for O
external O
storage O
and O
HDMI O
. O

Again O
Amazon O
comes O
through O
with O
flying O
colors O
. O

It O
does O
not O
work O
well O
on O
photos O
or O
video O
if O
you O
are O
comparing O
it O
to O
products O
designed O
specifically O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

When O
they O
guy O
got O
back O
on O
the O
line O
and O
informed O
that O
YES O
THEY O
DID O
HAVE O
IT O
IN O
STOCK O

This O
one O
is O
not O
bad O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
cool O
it O
off O
. O

I O
really O
like O
it O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
, O
frankly O
, O
a O
little O
disappointed O
in O
its O
sound O
quality O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
cheaply O
made O
. O

Belkin O
Hard O
mount O
with O
battery O
charger O
. O

I O
hate O
doing O
that O
because O
it O
scratches O
up O
and O
cracks O
the O
face O
plates O
around O
the O
ports O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
have O
to O
clear O
out O
is O
that O
this O
speaker O
will O
not O
give O
you O
home O
theater O
quality O
sound O
, O
it O
sounds O
great O
for O
it O
's O
size O
but O
do O
n't O
expect O
it O
to O
do O
more O
than O
it O
actually O
can O
. O

They O
are O
fairly O
loud O
, O
but O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
meh O
. O

Being O
a O
grad O
student O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
budget O
speakers O
and O
was O
definitely O
impressed O
by O
them O
when O
I O
got O
them O
. O

Most O
would O
not O
even O
notice O
, O
but O
for O
an O
audiophile O
they O
are O
quite O
evident O
. O

A O
very O
durable O
product O
and O
will O
accept O
wear O
gracefully O
and O
keep O
on O
& O
# O
34;trucking&#34;. O
A O
good O
price O
for O
a O
durable O
product O
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
carrying O
case O
. O

I O
ordered O
for O
my O
2009 O
Unibody O
Macbook O
Pro O
and O
it O
's O
perfect O
. O

Backup O

This O
is O
a O
very O
sturdy O

As O
for O
the O
ink O
refills O
, O
you O
can O
get O
any O
micro O
- O
ball O
pen O

. O

It O
not O
only O
made O
it O
the O
next O
day O
, O
but O
it O
arrived O
early O
morning O
! O

If O
you O
use O
your O
LP O
on O
battery O
a O
lot O
and O
like O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
cooler O
, O
you O
will O
find O
yourself O
being O
selective O
as O
to O
how O
much O
you O
run O
the O
fans O
. O
Turning O
them O
off O
on O
this O
cooler O
and O
leaving O
it O
under O
your O
unit O
will O
result O
in O
very O
little O
heat O
being O
transferred O
to O
the O
plastic O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
this O
Netbook O
again O
! O
! O

Short O
and O
sweet O
: O
You O
really O
do O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
, O
especially O
with O
computers O
. O

Connections O
to O
networks O
( O
wired O
and O
wireless O
) O
easier O
than O
under O
XP O
. O

The O
keys O
are O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
cool O
. O

With O
the O
computer O
's O
network O
adapter O
I O
usually O
got O
speeds O
of O
1 O
. O
5 O
to O
2 O
. O

It O
only O
came O
with O
one O
item O
to O
help O
you O
attach O
the O
table O
to O
the O
keyboard O
. O

It O
is O
fine O
for O
those O
purposes O
but O
you O
should O
not O
get O
it O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
heavy O
processing O
or O
memory O
- O
intensive O
tasks O
. O

I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
three O
days O
now O

In O
my O
case O
, O
I O
was O
already O
using O
a O
Griffin O
iMic O
, O
USB O
audio O
adapter O
to O
amplify O
my O
current O
headset O
that O
I O
use O
for O
VOIP O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

I O
would O
absolutely O
recommend O
this O
television O
to O
any O
looking O
for O
a O
high O
quality O
flat O
screen O
. O

Price O
was O
right O
. O

Low O
points O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
features O
but O
just O
right O
to O
carry O
ipad O
and O
cables O
when O
traveling O
for O
work O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
was O
expecting O
to O
be O
disappointed O
because O
the O
1005HA O
has O
been O
so O
dependable O
and O
functional O
. O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
. O

I O
take O
it O
to O
meetings O
to O
take O
minutes O
( O
Open O
Office O
) O
, O
keyboard O
is O
big O
enough O
; O
later O
transfer O
the O
files O
to O
my O
desktop O
( O
thumb O
drive O
as O
I O
can O
not O
make O
the O
One O
see O
the O
Win O
network O
) O
, O
edit O
, O
print O
and O
email O
the O
minutes O
. O

It O
is O
well O
built O
and O
compact O
, O
making O
it O
easy O
to O
transport O
. O

It O
took O
me O
nearly O
two O
months O
to O
make O
a O
final O
decision O
. O

I O
can O
plug O
in O
my O
lamp O
/ O
clock O
/ O
etc O
. O
without O
needing O
a O
power O
strip O
( O
which O
is O
what O
I O
had O
before).I O
also O
leave O
a O
couple O
USB O
cables O
plugged O
in O
. O

The O
drive O
is O
not O
terrible O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
number O
of O
fixed O
FL O
( O
14/2 O
. O
8 O
, O
28/2 O
. O

That O
's O
the O
reason O
I O
use O
it O
. O

overall O
I O
'd O
go O
with O
something O
metal O
next O
time O

Big O
improvement O
over O
the O
old O
battery O
and O
my O
parents O
report O
that O
after O
a O
few O
months O
it O
is O
still O
performing O
well O
. O

I O
certainly O
am O
happy O
with O
my O
bargain O
purchase O
. O

Very O
good O
product O
at O
a O
very O
good O
price O
. O

Have O
had O
for O
2 O
months O
now O
, O
no O
problems O
, O
no O
overheating O
issues O
. O

This O
is O
a O
spare O
laptop O
that O
is O
n't O
used O
very O
often O
, O
but O
it O
appears O
this O
battery O
will O
work O
very O
well O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

My O
D600 O
uses O
a O
Spade O
- O
type O
of O
HDD O
interface O
connection O
. O

I O
definitely O
recommend O
them O
for O
travel O
in O
Europe O
. O

The O
BEST O
Microfiber O
cloths O
I O
've O
ever O
used O
. O

Things O
like O
aircards O
, O
antennas O
, O
card O
readers O
, O
connectors O
for O
an O
external O
mouse O
, O
etc O
. O

but O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
slow O
me O
down O

If O
I O
had O
to O
do O
it O
over O
again O
I O
would O
n't O
buy O
this O
laptop O
. O

The O
enclosure O
consists O
of O
two O
parts O
. O

If O
this O
fits O
your O
computer O
/ O
laptop O
, O
do O
n't O
think O
twice O
, O
I O
installed O
it O
on O
my O
MacMini O
Server O
and O
it O
is O
worth O
every O
buck O
! O

Gaming O
mouse O
provided O
by O

If O
Google O
decides O
that O
you O
may O
not O
run O
Netflix O
tomorrow O
, O
Netflix O

gone O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
cuts O
down O
on O
the O

from O

Thorny O
ThumbstickMy O
main O
complaint O
with O
the O
thumbstick O
is O
that O
it O
is O
just O
not O
comfortable O
. O

So O
... O
YES O
for O
only O
use O
with O
flash O
memory O
sticks O
. O

The O
price O
here O
was O
more O
reasonable O
than O
at O
the O
chain O
superstore O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

This O
product O
has O
a O
small O
footprint O
but O
carries O
a O
lot O
of O
power O
. O

It O
's O
normal O
, O
functioning O
perfectly O
. O

1 O
easely O
, O
but O
wanted O
a O
PIN O
, O
which O
the O
Tab O
prompted O
a O
default O
. O

A O
little O
high O
priced O
, O
but O
I O
did O
get O
two O
patches O
. O

There O
is O
an O
additional O
pocket O
that O
is O
large O
enough O
for O
an O
Ipad O
and O
several O
files O
/ O
books O
, O
plus O
another O
magaine O
sized O
pocket O
. O

Price O
was O
good O
. O

and O
I O
now O
have O
to O
go O
buy O
another O
. O

Another O
PA-3E O
adapter O
works O
fine O
on O
my O
PC O
, O
so O
it O
is O
definitely O
this O
product O
that O
is O
the O
problem O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
sturdy O
case O
that O
will O
protect O
your O
Nook O
from O
anything O
and O
everything O
, O
this O
case O
is O
the O
perfect O
choice O
. O

I O
see O
the O
speed O
listed O
at O
1 O
. O
0 O
Gbps O
when O
connected O
to O
a O
1 O
. O
0 O
Gbps O
switch O
. O

I O
was O
moving O
a O
few O
wires O
and O
ZAP O
! O

Slowest O
flash O
drive O
on O
the O
planet O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
( O
simply O
plug O
into O
an O
open O
port O
) O
and O
works O
great O
so O
far O
. O

I O
played O
music O
with O
, O
and O
without O
the O
amp O
, O
and O
the O
difference O
is O
quite O
remarkable O
. O

It O
probably O
does O
not O
have O
the O
same O
capacity O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
. O

to O
charge O
using O
the O
provided O
USB O
cable O
. O

and O
I O
would O
n't O
mind O
if O
were O
a O
bit O
slimmer O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
type O
. O

2 O
and O
so O
far O
I O
've O
had O
zero O
problems O
. O

Not O
as O
comfortable O
as O
the O
TM2 O
for O
carrying O
around O
. O

Acer O
was O
n't O
the O
least O
bit O
helpful O
, O
but O
the O
Toshiba O
forum O
moderator O
was O
quite O
responsive O
and O
tried O
very O
hard O
- O
but O
neither O
company O
was O
able O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

Places O
for O
everything O
and O
above O
average O
quality O
. O

as O
they O
often O
have O
micro O
usb O
ports O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
cheaper O
set O
than O
this O
, O
but O
I O
have O
learned O
you O
get O
the O
best O
sound O
from O
a O
larger O
subwoofer O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
to O
reboot O
my O
tablet O
. O

woudln't O
recognize O
any O
of O
my O
USB O
drive O
, O
so O
we O
called O
Sony O
to O
send O
a O
drive O
to O
us O
and O
problem O
mostly O
fixed O
. O

This O
adapter O
was O
purchased O
for O
a O
desktop O
unit O
to O
connect O
my O
various O
bluetooth O
devices O
. O

Believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
my O
" O
mousepad O
" O
was O
the O
rounded O
arm O
of O
my O
maple O
sitting O
chair.)The O
top O
of O
the O
mouse O

I O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
daughters O
college O
apartment O
. O

Plus O
being O
a O
student O
, O
I O
got O
a O
discount O
from O
[ O
... O
] O

but O
I O
will O
post O
an O
updated O
review O
if O
that O
happens O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
some O
other O
products O
cool O
as O
much O
as O
20 O
degrees O

i O
like O
the O
rubberized O
feel O
to O
this O
hard O
case O
. O

The O
picture O
is O
great O
. O

Wish O
I O
had O
seen O
this O
one O
first O
! O

An O
stand O
- O
alone O
battery O
charger O
. O

i O
definitely O
noticed O
it O
keeping O
my O
laptop O
cool O
. O

I O
did O
a O
few O
full O
charge O
/ O
discharge O
cycles O
like O
instructed O

zoom O
, O
55 O
mm O
, O
and O
35 O

125 O
mm O
lenses O
. O

My O
pros O
and O
cons O
will O
match O
those O
of O
most O
others O
. O

Love O
this O
bag O
and O
would O
suggest O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
ordered O
it O
right O
away O
on O
a O
Wednesday O
and O
i O
received O
it O
on O
Saturday O
evening O
! O

The O
Jabra O
is O
like O
a O
draped O
scarf O
draped O
over O
your O
head O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
find O
tutorials O
online O
that O
help O
you O
set O
up O
the O
PS4 O
controller O

I O
also O
use O
the O
stand O
mode O
more O
than O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
. O

6 O
laptop O
, O
it O
fits O
great O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

The O
small O
stuff O
, O
like O
lack O
of O
ports O
can O
all O
be O
fixed O
with O
hubs O
and O
USB O
plug O
ins O
. O

Any O
solutions?]Be O
prepared O
to O
be O
shocked O
by O
the O
small O
package O
that O
arrives O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
its O
diminutive O
contents O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
works O
fine O
. O

Was O
prefect O
for O
what O
I O
needed O
it O
for O
. O

i. O
e. O
, O
video O
rendering O
. O

so O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
if O
the O
keyboard O
itself O
is O
voltage O
sensitive O
or O
just O
has O
issues O
with O
non O
- O
alkaline O
batteries O
. O

Solid O
buy O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

The O
MID-7048 O
does O
not O
have O
a O
USB O
port O
- O
so O
the O
keyboard O
can O
not O
be O
used O
with O
it O
. O

The O
driver O
setup O
and O
installation O
on O
my O
Windows O
7 O
( O
64 O
bit O
) O
system O
was O
simple O
and O
painless O
, O
as O
it O
should O
be O
for O
such O
a O
simple O
device O
. O

I O
heard O
that O
they O
have O
been O
building O
computers O
for O
many O
brands O
for O
years O
and O
have O
only O
recently O
started O
selling O
under O
their O
own O
name O
. O

It O
was O
broken O
i O
had O
to O
put O
it O
back O
together O

This O
bag O
looks O
great O
, O
holds O
nicely O
through O
rain O
and O
shine O
, O
and O
has O
n't O
shown O
any O
sign O
of O
wear O
and O
tear O
after O
daily O
use O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
it O
's O
a O
cheap O
product O
. O

and O
( O
here O
's O
the O
most O
important O
part O
) O

99 O
from O
Amazon O
( O
sold O
by O
Onsale O
) O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
was O
that O
bad O
. O

It O
's O
stiff O
and O
odd O

Some O
guy O
gave O
it O
a O
3 O
stars O
... O
and O
he O
was O
explaining O
that O
the O
card O
failed O
... O
saying O
that O
he O
had O
to O
format O
the O
card O
... O

The O
cost O
was O
competitive O
with O
the O
other O
brands O
of O
cases O
that O
I O
considered O
. O

Had O
an O
ASUS O
Wireless O
- O
AC O
USB O
connected O
device O
for O
2 O
months O
that O
I O
loved O
, O
but O
it O
just O
suddenly O
stopped O
working O
( O
a O
tale O
for O
another O
rating O
) O
and O
I O
returned O
to O
using O
this O
one O
. O

But O
its O
so O
much O
easier O
than O
older O
Macs O
that O
have O
a O
button O
to O
click O
. O

Made O
in O
China O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
seeing O
more O
from O
Vizio O
in O
the O
ultrabook O
market O
. O

It O
got O
that O
hot O
. O

For O
a O
low O
cost O
, O
compact O
antenna O
, O
I O
find O
this O
one O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

The O
one O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
is O
a O
different O
story O
. O

The O
time O
to O
receive O
the O
battery O
was O
acceptable O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
I O
'll O
breakdown O
what O
I O
think O
of O
this O
laptop O
piece O
by O
piece O
. O

Very O
often O
it O
used O
to O
shut O
down O
from O
heating O
. O

I O
read O
in O
the O
reviews O
that O
the O
cord O
was O
6 O
feet O
long O
( O
way O
too O
much O
) O
however O
mine O
was O
actually O
about O
2 O
ft O
long O
( O
perfect O
size O
) O
overall O
its O
a O
great O
product O
. O

This O
one O
is O
being O
returned O
. O

It O
still O
has O
plenty O
of O
speed O
for O
my O
uses O
though O
. O

The O
internal O
Bluetooth O
and O
WLAN O
Card O
is O
NOT O
supported- O

Unfortunately O
Energizer O
is O
extremely O
successful O
at O
getting O
stores O
to O
stock O
this O
junk O
. O

Tumi O
does O
not O
back O
or O
claim O
this O
thus O
offering O
only O
a O
5 O
year O
warranty O
. O

, O
I O
'm O
never O
buying O
anything O
made O
by O
them O
ever O
again O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
battery O
for O
my O
lenovo O
R61 O
. O

WITH O
( O
incredibly O
rude O
, O
unhelpful O
, O
and O
unapologetic O
) O
AND O

My O
original O
though O
was O
an O
Ubuntu O
netbook O
for O

ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
. O

This O
allows O
the O
plug O
to O
move O
to O
many O
different O
positions O
in O
the O

configuration O

IM O
SO O
HAPPY O

Going O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
storage O
space O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
keyboard O
easily O
after O
watching O
a O
video O
on O
U O
Tube O
. O

Good O
comfort O
for O
a O
small O
price O
. O

The O
primary O
button O
was O
misclicking O
then O
stopped O
working O
. O

The O
mouse O
is O
very O
responsive O
and O
the O
lighting O
makes O
it O
an O
attractive O
mouse O
. O

No O
BluetoothIn O
all O
, O
I O
use O
every O
feature O
that O
comes O
with O
this O
Notebook O
. O

The O
one O
foot O
length O
is O
the O
perfect O
for O
a O
car O
, O
laptop O
bag O
, O
pocket O
or O
purse O
. O

Is O
this O
the O
perfect O
netbook O
? O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
this O
cable O
and O
will O
purchase O
from O
them O
again O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
in O
hope O
to O
help O
my O
mom O
's O
HP O
computer O
to O
stay O
cool O
, O
but O
it O
only O
does O
half O
the O
job O
. O

I O
WOULD O
RECOMMEND O
THIS O
TO O
ANYONE O
WHO O
DOES O
NOT O
WANT O
TO O
PAY O
BIG O
MONEY O
FROM O
TOSHIBA O
. O

Indeed O
, O
it O
's O
an O
attractive O
machine O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
built O
- O
in O
microphone O
is O
excellent O
for O
calls O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
about O
the O
other O
distributions O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
Debian O
based O
ones O
will O
have O
similar O
performance O
. O

The O
idea O
is O
to O
use O
a O
portable O
bluetooth O
speaker O
when O
it O
is O
late O
at O
night O
so O
as O
not O
to O
wake O
up O
the O
kids O
next O
room O
. O

I O
did O
look O
and O
try O
out O
other O
brands O
and O
they O
all O
had O
issues O
and O
felt O
cheap O
compared O
to O
HP O
. O

The O
price O
was O
right O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
build O
quality O
. O

I O
am O
really O
satisfied O
with O
the O
product O
and O
should O
have O
bought O
another O
for O
my O
brother O
. O

One O
the O
keyboard O
is O
paired O
, O
type O
the O
six O
digit O
code O
on O
the O
keyboard O
, O
and O
then O
press O
enter O
, O
now O
you O
are O
off O
to O
the O
races O
. O

Apparently O
HP O
only O
allows O
the O
ORIGINAL O
DRIVE O
to O
accept O
the O
user O
made O
recovery O
disks O
. O

We O
will O
be O
buying O
more O
for O
our O
church O
since O
speakers O
come O
with O
all O
kind O
of O
configuration O
needs O
. O

some O
of O
the O
laptops O
here O
in O
the O
last O
year O
or O
so O
have O
been O
less O
than O
stellar O
but O
they O
still O
sell O
great O
, O
and O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
rather O
nice O
. O

This O
system O
was O
n't O
what O
i O
was O
searching O
for O
, O
it O
however O
was O
good O
enough O
to O
make O
my O
customer O
smile O
and O
even O
pay O
an O
additional O
$ O
70 O
just O
for O
my O
delivery O
. O

This O
battery O
gives O
the O
x220 O
Tablet O
an O
amazing O
amount O
of O
life O
. O

Would O
n't O
expect O
this O
to O
be O
my O
only O
line O
of O
protection O
, O
though O
. O

Used O
it O
for O
IR O
remote O
extension O
. O

that O
's O
exactly O
what O
I O
'm O
looking O
for O
. O

I O
found O
this O
item O
to O
be O
very O
helpful O
. O

It O
's O
a O
perfect O
in O
our O
family O
room O
. O

This O
keyboard O
is O
a O
good O
item O
to O
have O
if O
you O
tend O
to O
type O
a O
bunch O
and O
have O
a O
phone O
or O
tablet O
to O
use O
. O

Prices O
will O
continue O
to O
come O
down O
, O
and O
traditional O
hard O
drive O
manufacturers O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
offer O
larger O
and O
larger O
drives O
at O
cheaper O
prices O
, O
as O
it O
will O
be O
the O
only O
way O
they O
can O
compete O
with O
a O
clearly O
superior O
technology O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
backpack O
as O
my O
only O
carry O
- O
on O
bag O
for O
my O
last O
three O
business O
trips O
and O
it O
has O
been O
great O
. O

Lots O
of O
space O
and O
easy O
to O
carry O
. O

Where O
you O
have O
it O
dled O
, O
place O
in O
VLCPortable\App\vlcKEYDB O

I O
was O
concerned O
the O
back O
would O
get O
scratched O
, O
and O
also O
found O
the O
back O
of O
the O
iPad O
somewhat O
slick O
which O
made O
it O
harder O
to O
hold O
comfortably O
while O
reading O
. O

It O
does O
what O
it O
does O
quite O
well O
, O
and O
it O
is O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
pack O
of O
gum O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
does O
nt O
even O
fit O
. O

With O
modest O
thought O
going O
in O
re O
: O
cable O
management O
, O
along O
with O
frequent O
pauses O
to O
assess O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
difficult O
to O
keep O
things O
somewhat O
in O
order O
. O

I O
had O
to O
buy O
2 O
of O
them O
when O
my O
first O
one O
stopped O
functioning O
properly O
. O

You O
also O
have O
to O
remove O
two O
screws O
that O
are O
hidden O
underneath O
the O
two O
back O
rubber O
feet O
. O

worked O
right O

Bought O
this O
when O
the O
battery O
of O
my O
wife O
's O
Aspire O

died O
. O

When O
you O
don O
, O
t O
need O
a O
long O
cord O
this O
works O
great O
. O

This O
one O
works O
perfectly O
, O
no O
problems O
. O

The O
material O
and O
built O
quality O
are O
excellent O
and O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
stability O
problems O
while O
using O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
is O
wrong O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
do O
it O
constantly O
. O

I O
could O
live O
without O
the O
electronic O
tones O
at O
power O
up O
/ O
power O
down O
, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
as O
grating O
as O
others O
I O
've O
heard O
. O

I O
had O
a O

The O

It O

the O

) O
and O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
inside O
, O
keeps O
it O
protected O
, O
it O
has O
enough O
pockets O
for O
my O
liking O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
great O
, O
been O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
( O
keep O
in O
mind O
my O
laptop O
weights O
a O
bit O
since O
its O
a O
gaming O
pc O
) O
, O
that O
and O
my O
college O
books O
have O
n't O
damaged O
the O
backpack O
at O
all O
, O
there O
are O
no O
sings O
of O
wear O
on O
the O
straps O
or O
zips O

Well O
that O
is O
a O
quick O
rundown O
and O
my O
initial O
impressions O
after O
using O
the O
Chromebook O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

If O
they O
were O
shining O
at O
me O
directly O
( O
like O
the O
blinding O
power O
button O
on O
my O
computer O
) O
, O
I O
'd O
hate O
them O
; O
but O
since O
the O
light O
is O
reflected O
and O
ambient O
, O
it O
's O
pretty O
neat O
. O

After O
200 O
, O
000 O
miles O
chock O
full O
of O
equipment O
, O
mishandled O
by O
the O
airlines O
, O
and O
thru O
all O
kinds O
of O
weather O
, O
the O
old O
bag O
started O
to O
wear O
out O
. O

Run O
the O
setup O
utility O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
senior O
dad O
, O
as O
one O
of O
his O
Christmas O
gifts O
. O

A O
7800 O
mAh O
battery O
will O
give O
you O
5 O
hours O
per O
charge O
when O
it O
's O
new O
. O

it O
's O
way O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

The O
Air O
has O
the O
full O
- O
size O
keyboard O

This O
grid O
- O
it O
organizer O
cleaned O
up O
all O
the O
mess O
in O
my O
bag O
. O

It O
does O
have O
instant O
start O
- O
up O
, O
but O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
seconds O
before O
the O
mouse O
cursor O
appears O
. O

If O
you O
trust O
the O
Apple O
designers O
, O
and O
believe O
Apple O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
( O
after O
using O
a O
Mac O
, O
I O
for O
one O
do O
) O
then O
the O
Mac O
beats O
the O
PC O
for O
pure O
efficiency O
of O
time O
and O
key O
clicks O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
one O
other O
complaint O
is O
the O
backlighted O
keys O
. O

My O
wife O
is O
a O
school O
teacher O
and O
has O
a O
Surface O
RT O
. O

Though O
the O
instructions O
are O
for O
windows O
7 O
, O
it O
does O
work O
for O
Windows O
8 O
. O

Product O
is O
as O
described O
. O

Battery O
compartment O
was O
difficult O
to O
open O
and O
battery O
was O
quite O
loose O
inside O
- O
causing O
a O
power O
issue O
if O
bumped O
and O
while O
typing O
. O

Orange O
is O
n't O
for O
everyone O

Over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
I O
had O
to O
keep O
reseting O
the O
WAP O
as O
it O
would O
freeze O
( O
no O
loss O
of O
signal O
, O
just O
freeze O
) O
. O

These O
are O
really O
good O
Laptop O
briefcases O
. O

so O
I O
do O
not O
think O
this O
should O
be O
described O
as O
universal O
. O

While O
the O
touch O
side O
of O
Windows O
8 O
is O
very O
capable O
, O
in O
day O
to O
day O
use O
, O
no O
Windows O
machine O
is O
quite O
as O
nice O
to O
use O
in O
conventional O
mode O
. O

" O
Battery O
not O
recognized O
" O
( O
not O
the O
exact O
words O
- O
but O
something O
similar O
" O
) O
- O
I O
could O
not O
test O
this O
item O
since O
it O
did O
not O
work O
with O
my O
laptop O
so O
I O
am O
giving O
it O
only O
1 O
star O
. O

It O
has O
numerous O
pockets O
and O
sub O
- O
pockets O
and O
is O
well O
padded O
, O
including O
the O
straps O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
have O
written O
a O
review O
that O
will O
give O
information O
to O
those O
who O
have O
not O
yet O
bought O
this O
machine O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
the O
cover O
works O
wwell O
and O
you O
can O
see O
the O
keys O
okay O
. O

Despite O
the O
reviews O
, O
I O
think O
I O
got O
an O
excellent O
deal O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
item O
because O
my O
granddaughter O
kept O
forgetting O
to O
bring O
her O
charger O
over O
. O

Belkin O
then O
plug O
IPod O
. O

I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
Vanguard O
before O
, O
but O
the O
quality O
was O
really O
nice O
and O
it O
was O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
portable O
on O
foot O

This O
keyboard O
is O
a O
few O
dollars O
more O
than O
some O
others O
, O
but O
I O
think O
you O
'll O
find O
it O
to O
be O
well O
worth O
the O
difference O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
product O
.. O

If O
the O
pouch O
was O
lowered O
a O
little O
then O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
an O
issue O
. O

At O
least O
I O
believe O
so O
. O

But O
this O
USB O
adapter O
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
used O
monitor O
that O
turned O
out O
to O
have O
a O
scratch O
and O
a O
smudge O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
off O
. O

I O
loaded O
the O
drivers O
, O
popped O
it O
in O
and O
it O
worked O
, O
no O
fuss O
. O

It O
's O
very O
nicely O
designed O
, O
looks O
great O
, O
is O
very O
portable O
, O
has O
a O
great O
display O
, O
a O
fine O
keyboard O
, O
very O
good O
performance O
, O
and O
some O
nice O
bits O
like O
a O
full O
size O
HDMI O
port O
. O

that O
are O
n't O

Full O
disclosure O
.... O

The O
speakers O
are O
awful O
in O
several O
ways O
like O
: O
low O
sound O
, O
terrible O
location O
( O
at O
the O
front O
bottom O
) O
, O
and O
overall O
low O
quality O
sound O
. O

The O
top O
compartment O
has O
pockets O
to O
put O
more O
" O
stuff O
" O
like O
munchies O
or O
a O

this O
is O
a O
" O
Safety O
System O

to O
protect O
the O
electrical O
system O
of O

vehicle O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
was O
durable O
, O
that O
would O
protect O
the O
face O
, O
and O
basically O
look O
like O
nothing O
was O
there O

This O
was O
solved O
by O
using O
a O
combination O
of O
products O
: O

I O
was O
however O
impressed O
with O
the O
volume O
it O
can O
produce O
. O

and O
I O
could O
have O
got O
a O
more O
known O
brand O
for O
that O
price O
, O
but O
non O
of O
those O
well O
known O
brand O
out O
there O
even O
came O
close O
to O
these O
beauties O
in O
terms O
of O
looks O
and O
aesthetics O
! O

Useful O
in O
niche O
situations O
I O
suppose O
. O

Purchased O
for O
my O
4 O
year O
old O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
L305-S5921 O
. O

This O
item O
works O
great O
. O

Product O
met O
or O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O

up O
within O
a O
few O
seconds O
after O

Fits O
good O
and O
will O
work O

Great O
bag O
for O
carrying O
everything O
you O
need O
to O
bring O
along O

6 O
" O
laptops O
since O
they O
do O
n't O
all O
have O
the O
exact O
same O
dimensions O
even O
if O
their O
screen O
size O
is O
the O
same O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
use O
the O
backup O
software O
that O
it O
came O
with O
, O
because O
I O
used O
my O
own O
which O
I O
love O
. O

Not O
wanting O
to O
spend O
another O
$ O
50 O
, O
I O
will O
be O
sticking O
with O
XP O
. O

However O
, O
the O
problems O
begin O
when O
you O
try O
to O
do O
more O
than O
a O
few O
things O
at O
once O
. O

: O
Unless O
you O
have O
a O
new O
printer O
that O
supports O
Google O
Cloud O
print O
the O
ability O
to O
print O
was O
a O
shortcoming O
of O
chromebooks O
. O

I O
have O
four O
complaints O
. O

That O
way O
you O
do O
n't O
loose O
a O
port O

I O
was O
n't O
sure O
if O
this O
would O
be O
compatible O
with O
Linux O
( O
Ubuntu O
13 O
. O
10 O
) O
, O
but O
it O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
if O
you O
get O
a O
great O
deal O
on O
it O
then O
its O
worth O
purchasing O
as O
a O
utility O
item O
otherwise O
there O
are O
probably O
better O
alternatives O
. O

I O
also O
got O
caught O
in O
a O
small O
burst O
of O
rain O
and O
the O
bag O
seemed O
to O
hold O
up O
nicely O
in O
the O
rain O
, O
even O
before O
I O
put O
on O
the O
rain O
cover O
that O
's O
included O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
few O
extra O
USB O
ports O
on O
my O
laptop O
but O
did O
n't O
want O
the O
hassle O
of O
having O
to O
have O
an O
additional O
power O
source O
or O
mess O
with O
software O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
ample O
. O

COULD O
NOT O
ASK O
FOR O
ANY O
THING O
BETTER O

This O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
battery O
life O
. O

Once O
the O
network O
is O
set O
up O
, O
it O
gets O
the O
latest O
update O
automatically O
. O

the O
forward O
and O
back O
buttons O
are O
very O
useful O
. O

This O
should O
Autoplay O
a O
program O
on O
the O
C120 O
called O
" O
Acer O
DisplayPal O
" O
which O
will O
mirror O
your O
laptop O
display O
at O
default O
setting O
of O
800X600 O
but O
can O
be O
manually O
set O
to O
WXGA O
( O

I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
model O
otherwise O
. O

Put O
it O
in O
and O
had O
no O
error O
messages O
of O
any O
kind O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
given O
this O
bag O
the O
ultimate O
test O
-- O
taking O
it O
on O
a O
trip O
-- O
but O
I O
have O
carried O
it O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
work O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
now O
to O
give O
it O
as O
thorough O
a O
work O
- O
out O
as O
I O
could O
. O

So O
, O
started O
a O
frustrating O
process O
of O
dealing O
with O
Acer O
service O
. O

After O
that O
switch O
, O
I O
went O
through O
a O
series O
of O
very O
poor O
quality O
KVM O
switches O
that O
rarely O
worked O
for O
more O
than O
24 O
hours O
, O
and O
I O
finally O
gave O
up O
in O
disgust O
with O
consumer O
KVM O
switches O
. O

The O
eco O
- O
utility O
settings O
that O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
power O
the O
computer O
consumes O
really O
works O
but O
also O
dims O
the O
screen O

First O
, O
I O
noticed O
when O
the O
lid O
was O
closed O
, O
there O
was O
a O
gap O
on O
the O
right O
side O
( O
the O
drive O
side O
) O
compared O
to O
the O
left O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
quite O
good O
for O
the O
size O
. O

Nice O
cheap O
head O
set O
. O

so O
if O
I O
needed O
extra O
lens O
or O
whatever O
I O
could O
not O
take O
them O
with O
me O
. O

The O
second O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
orange O
seems O
a O
little O
too O
safety O
colored O
. O

Firstly O
, O
you O
can O
remove O
them O
, O
or O
move O
them O
around O
. O

The O
dual O
graphics O
cards O
work O
well O

All O
- O
in O
- O
all O
, O
it O
took O
me O
less O
than O
5 O
minutes O
to O
install O
the O
shield O
and O
get O
the O
major O
bubbles O
out O
. O

Not O
original O
Apple O
overpriced O
power O
supply O

Would O
recommend O
this O
case O
for O
persons O
with O
a O
small O
tablet O
. O

It O
fits O
absolutely O
perfectly O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
left O
any O
marks O
on O
the O
screen O
but O
may O
leave O
some O
dust O
on O
the O
screen O
when O
you O
close O
the O
laptop O
. O

Ca O
n't O
misplace O
this O
given O
the O
bright O
red O
color O
. O

I O
had O
been O
happy O
with O
my O
Case O
Logic O
TBC-307 O
Camera O
Bag O
- O
that O
was O
up O
until O
I O
acquired O
another O
lens O
, O
the O
Canon O
EF O
50 O
mm O
f/1 O
. O

Great O
to O
have O
it O
while O
travelling O
in O
the O
car O
. O

This O
allowed O
me O
to O
unplug O
the O
computer O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
case O
, O
and O
blow O
the O
fire O
out O
within O
seconds O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
really O
large O
computer O
that O
has O
serious O
overheating O
issues O
, O
you O
might O
want O
a O
larger O
one O
with O
2 O
fans O
, O
but O
this O
one O
does O
the O
duty O
. O

After O
about O
3 O
years O
, O
the O
original O
battery O
in O
my O
Dell O
Vostro O
1500 O
laptop O
has O
gone O
the O
way O
of O
the O
dodo O
. O

As O
a O
small O
internet O
business O
owner O
, O
I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
portable O
and O
reliable O
. O

Each O
time O
I O
've O
attempted O
to O
zip O
the O
case O

conf O
mod O
to O
use O
the O
display O
without O
the O
dock O
. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
make O
them O
work O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mini O
ipad O
and O
it O
looks O
better O
than O
expected O
. O

The O
Optoma O
however O
has O
a O
workaround O
. O

Best O
MP3 O
Mini O
Portable O
Capsule O
Speaker O
of O
the O
Year O
. O

I O
love O
how O
its O
not O
rubber O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
cover O
. O

It O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
rearrange O
the O
padding O
inside O
to O
give O
any O
lens O
a O
snug O
fit O
. O

I O
've O
taken O
this O
thing O
all O
over O
from O
Hawaii O
to O
New O
York O
to O
Florida O
to O
New O
Mexico O
. O

The O
design O
is O
more O
workmanlike O
than O
artistic O
( O
if O
my O
Macbook O
was O
a O
Porshce O
, O
this O
might O
be O
a O
Honda O
Accord O
) O
but O
the O
build O
is O
quality O
with O
aluminum O
making O
up O
the O
lid O
and O
chassis O
. O

There O
appears O
to O
be O
no O
obvious O
vignetting O
. O

I O
'm O
quite O
satisfied O
. O

Also O
, O
watch O
for O
the O
price O
as O
I O
bought O
this O
in O
Jan O
2010 O
for O
under O
twenty O
dollars O
( O
half O
what O
it O
is O
listed O
for O
now O
) O
but O
it O
was O
selling O
for O
3x O
that O
between O
the O
time O
I O
ordered O
mine O
and O
received O
it O
( O
just O
a O
few O
days).Update O
: O
I O
am O
now O
using O
this O
adapter O
in O
a O
Vista O
32bit O
Desktop O
set O
up O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

good O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
would O
buy O
another O
one O
if O
i O
needed O
it O
. O

It O
lights O
up O
just O
like O
the O
stock O
one O
, O
and O
the O
computer O
charges O
with O
no O
issue O
. O

It O
's O
a O
beast O
, O
clearly O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
: O

would O

take O
your O

would O
you O
? O

You O
can O
feel O
the O

This O
is O
a O
good O
one O

I O
've O
tripped O
over O
the O
power O
cable O
and O
the O
magsafe O
saved O
me O
from O
doing O
any O
damage O
to O
the O
power O
supply O

. O

The O
price O
could O
not O
be O
beat O

I O
drive O
a O
Honda O

and O
this O
charger O
worked O
great O

When O
trying O
to O
customize O
an O
hp O
laptop O
with O
almost O
the O
exact O
specs O
it O
comes O
to O
over O
$ O
1200 O
bucks O
. O

My O
wife O
will O
mainly O
be O
using O
it O
to O
run O
Windows O
software O
, O
and O
I O
guess O
I O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
netbook O
for O
traveling O
at O
a O
third O
( O
or O
less O
) O
the O
price O
. O

Holds O
every O
option O
I O
have O
for O
the O
laptop O
such O
as O
cords O

etc O
. O

The O
plethora O
of O
front O
pockets O
are O
great O
for O
storing O
different O
belongings O
and O
the O
different O
compartments O
are O
helpful O
in O
keeping O
paperwork O
organized O
. O

I O
can O
run O
a O

off O
of O
it O

Good O

does O
as O
it O
states O

The O
printer O
worked O
ok O
with O
this O
hub O
, O
but O
then O
the O
ports O
start O
winking O
out O
, O
one O
at O
a O
time O
. O

it O
has O
a O

The O

shuts O
down O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
design O
issue O
and O
maybe O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O

I O
have O
also O
crammed O
so O
much O
in O
there O
that O
they O
were O
barely O
able O
to O

This O
is O
a O
must O

Some O
of O
the O
reviewers O
stated O
that O
the O
USB O
rate O
is O
only O
1/3 O
of O
the O

. O

I O
get O

in O
part O
of O
the O
upstairs O
but O
not O
all O

But O
I O
'm O
sure O
I O
just O
need O
to O
play O
around O
with O
the O

One O
of O
those O

you O
start O

There O
is O
no O
obvious O
way O
to O
temporarily O
disable O

It O
looks O

GREAT O
PRODUCT O
, O
ENGINEERED O
GREAT O
- O
and O
well O
worth O
the O
$ O
I O
use O
daily O
and O
have O
had O
for O
couple O
months O
now O

is O
that O
folks O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
. O

I O
did O
install O
Linux O
Ubuntu O
via O
crouton O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
much O
I O
'll O
use O
it O
. O

In O
the O
little O
zippered O
pocket O
you O
could O
carry O
extra O
micro O
SD O
's O
for O
secondary O
maps O
in O
your O
5 O
inch O
Garmin O
. O

I O
took O
a O
chance O
getting O
this O
charger O
since O
it O
did O
n't O
list O
the O
dv O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
Windows O
8 O
, O
then O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
has O
Windows O
8 O
installed O
, O
you O
have O
no O
right O
to O
complain O
about O
it O
in O
a O
review O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
star O
filter O
. O

I O
've O
installed O
and O
run O
Half O
- O
Life O
( O
the O
original O
) O

Just O
enough O
room O
for O
some O
wires O
and O
usb O
expanders O
. O

First O
off O
is O
an O
imprecise O
" O
TouchPad O
" O
mouse O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
one O
of O
these O
while O
in O
school O
; O
I O
was O
so O
paranoid O
about O
leaving O
my O
laptop O
unattended O
even O
just O
momentarily O
in O
the O
library O
, O
lounge O
, O
or O
at O
the O
coffee O
shop O
while O
going O
to O
use O
the O
restroom O
, O
and O
we O
had O
some O
issues O
with O
laptop O
thefts O
on O
campus O
. O

I O
sent O
this O
one O
back O
and O
kept O
the O
Vizair O
, O
and O
got O
a O
second O
Vizair O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
use O
for O
college O
. O

I O
took O
the O
netbook O
to O
my O
UPS O
store O
to O
ship O
back O
to O
Amazon O
with O
the O
supplied O
label O
on O
a O
Thursday O
and O
my O
return O
had O
been O
processed O
and O
refund O
issued O
by O
Sunday O
evening O
. O

That O
is O
not O
the O
case O
with O
the O
cable O
that O
comes O
with O
this O
item O
. O

They O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Works O
great O
with O
my O
tablet O
and O
smart O
phone O
. O

I O
wrote O
the O
company O
an O
email O
asking O
for O
help O
, O
and O
they O
responded O
by O
sending O
me O
a O
new O
address O
. O

and O
I O
love O
the O
extra O
storage O
pocket O
for O
the O
cable O
and O
charger O
! O

I O
took O
this O
adapter O
with O
me O
on O
a O
recent O
trip O
to O
the O
New O
Delhi O
/ O
Noida O
area O
. O

ICS O
with O
factory O
root O
enabled O
with O
BusyBox O
so O
that O
may O
be O
why O
. O

so O
it O
is O
functional O
, O
good O
looking O
, O
and O
will O
last O
nearly O
forever O
under O
hard O
use O
. O

Lights O
are O
also O
helpful O
as O
light O
is O
not O
always O
perfect O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
other O
reviews O
I O
check O
it O
before O
use O
. O

All O
can O
be O
done O
on O
this O
computer O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
navigate O
the O
Aps O
instead O
of O
saving O
things O
to O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
pen O
is O
superb O
. O

This O
creates O
a O
bulging O
outer O
pocket O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easier O
and O
quicker O
to O
store O
the O
AC O
adapter O
in O
the O
outer O
compartment O
than O
to O
arrange O
it O
each O
time O
vertically O
squeezed O
into O
one O
side O
of O
the O
main O
laptop O
compartment O
. O

Huge O
difference O
: O
I O
easily O
get O
7 O
hours O
instead O
of O
2 O
hours O
on O
the O
OQO.- O
Noise O
: O

The O
stills O
at O
2 O
MP O
may O
not O
have O
enough O
resolution O
for O
large O
prints O
, O
but O
they O
are O
incredible O
again O
on O
an O
HDTV O
as O
it O
displays O
them O
at O
a O
1:1 O
ratio O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
really O
is O
made O
for O
just O
Chromebook O
or O
something O
... O

It O
also O
has O
a O
normal O
HDMI O
so O
I O
can O
also O
connect O
it O
to O
my O
larger O
monitor O
when O
I O
'm O
home O
. O

SURE O
OUTLET O
IS O
GOOD O
TOO O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
cable O
for O
les$ O
, O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

The O
filter O
itself O
works O
great O
and O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
permanently O
mounting O
it O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

CareyShow O
- O
me O

State O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

The O
LCD O
screen O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
read O
the O
screen O
from O
several O
feet O
away O
. O

I O
upped O
it O
by O
a O
star O
as O
the O
burning O
seems O
to O
have O
stopped O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
quality O
and O
reliability O
. O

It O
worked O
immediately O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
fast O
drive O
and O
it O
works O
well O
for O
my O
needs O
as O
a O
college O
student O
. O

The O
cleaning O
cloth O
is O
not O
essential O
but O
a O
nice O
' O
extra O
' O
. O

The O
picture O
quality O
is O
not O
perfect O
. O

So O
I O
have O
plenty O
or O
experience O
with O
Windows O
and O
Macs O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
an O
attention O
to O
detail O
that O
I O
really O
appreciate O
on O
both O
the O
hardware O
and O
the O
software O
side O
- O
little O
things O
like O
a O
backlit O
, O
auto O
- O
dimming O
keyboard O
or O
the O
magnetic O
power O
connector O
. O

The O
channel O
is O
way O
too O
big O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
adjust O
it O
. O

The O
item O
is O
great O
and O
works O
as O
described O
. O

I O
have O
used O
this O
battery O
for O
two O
months O
with O
no O
issues O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
a O
HUGE O
difference O
in O
speed O
( O
this O
Sabrent O
device O
was O
3 O
TIMES O
slower O
than O
a O
generic O
USB O
2 O
enclosure O
) O
! O
! O

Holds O
all O
my O
stuff O
and O
very O
well O
made O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
travel O
( O
by O
air O
) O
. O

I O
can O
leave O
this O
plugged O
into O
my O
external O
monitor O
and O
turn O
off O
/ O
on O
when O
I O
wish O
. O

it O
was O
n't O
stable O
at O
all O
so O
even O
if O
it O
still O
worked O
she O
would O
n't O
be O
using O
it O
. O

I O
got O
this O
so O
I O
could O
charge O
my O
phone O
and O
use O
it O
in O
my O
bed O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

This O
device O
did O
n't O
perform O
as O
well O
as O
I O
had O
expected O
it O
to O
. O

You O
also O
get O
a O
30 O
day O
zero O
bright O
dot O
guarantee O
. O

The O
keys O
feel O
just O
as O
sturdy O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
case O
does O
and O
also O
retains O
that O
computer O
keyboard O
response O
many O
have O
come O
to O
expect O
. O

I O
was O
concerned O
that O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
type O
comfortably O
with O
my O
big O
hands O
/ O
fingers O

Great O

The O

4th O
IOGEAR O

but O

I O
almost O
lost O
it O
. O

; O
into O
position O
, O
so O
every O
time O
you O
move O
you O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
knocking O
the O
whole O
setup O
over O
. O

I O
miss O
feeling O
the O

of O
the O
Retina O
, O
but O
with O
the O
amount O
I O
carry O
my O
laptop O
around O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
having O
a O
little O
more O
protection O
. O

Good O
... O
just O
good O
! O

And O
it O
does O
a O
good O
job O
of O
charging O
and O
have O
outlet O
for O
other O
plug O
. O

Do O
n't O
listen O
to O
any O
of O
the O
bad O
reviews O
. O

( O
thank O
goodness O
it O
was O
under O
warranty O
) O
! O

what O
's O
awesome O
about O
this O
lil O
keyboard O
is O
that O
it O
makes O
your O
tablet O
into O
a O
laptop O
. O

Other O
models O
( O
such O
as O
the O
HP O

the O
Samsung O

) O
comes O
with O

well O
, O
and O
most O
people O
are O
happy O
with O
them.- O
I O

, O
the O
CR-48 O
( O
beta O
- O
test O

) O
and O
the O
HP O

and O
this O

trumps O
all O
of O
them O
in O
terms O
of O
performance.- O

Plus O
, O
the O
VGA O
and O
HDMI O
ports O
allow O
dual O
screen O
monitoring O
, O
which O
was O
important O
to O
us O
and O
a O
reason O
why O
we O
did O
not O
go O
for O
an O

Big O

all O
the O
things O
you O
would O
normally O
expect O
out O
of O

10 O
times O
the O
price O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O

I O
have O

this O
is O
a O
great O

over O

But O
that O
plug O
broke O
in O
half O
to O
give O
me O
the O
plug O
I O
needed O
. O

Also O
this O
mouse O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
ergonomic O
design O
with O
a O
thumb O
and O
a O
slight O
pinky O
rest O
, O
which O
is O
another O
feature O
that O
you O
normally O
could O
only O
find O
on O

30 O

corded O

The O

does O

It O
is O

, O
fits O
my O

to O
perfection O
, O
has O
a O
nice O
internal O
elastic O

, O
and O
can O
be O
used O
as O

The O

I O
can O
pan O
the O
camera O
faster O
now O
. O

I O
plugged O
the O
cable O
into O
the O
printer O
, O
plugged O
the O
USB O
connector O
into O
the O
laptop O
, O
turned O
on O
the O
printer O
and O
Windows O
immediately O
recognized O
the O
printer O
. O

Had O
trouble O
with O
the O
sound O
drivers O
that O
came O
with O
the O
unit O
( O
the O
attached O
speakers O
would O
not O
work O
) O
. O

I O
can O
have O
4 O
- O
5 O
applications O
open O
at O
a O
time O
with O
no O
slow O
- O
down O
and O
no O
crashing O
( O
this O
includes O
memory O
- O
hungry O
photo O
and O
music O
apps O
) O
. O

Plus O
the O
bag O
does O
n't O
even O
look O
like O
a O
camera O
/ O
laptop O
bag O
- O
consider O
the O
security O
it O
provides O
. O

it O
response O
is O
fast O
. O

All O
in O
all O
an O
excellent O
device O
that O
suits O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
. O

Numerical O
keypad O
on O
the O
laptop O
! O

I O
hate O
how O
the O
cords O
just O
hang O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

Very O
high O
quality O
construction O
. O

Works O
perfectly O
. O

My O
old O
laptop O
only O
had O
a O
40 O
GB O
hard O
drive O
and O
500 O
MB O
of O
RAM O

My O
Macbook O
's O
fan O
is O
louder O
than O
it O
, O
so O

The O
sound O
is O
about O
as O
good O
as O
I O
have O
ever O
heard O
from O
built O
in O
computer O
speakers O
. O

and O
he O
himself O
obviously O
does O
n't O
know O
a O
computer O
from O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O
he O
accidently O
blew O
yesterday O
.. O

Cheap O
is O
cheap O
. O

Fits O
perfectly O
. O

I O
chose O
this O
backpack O
over O
a O
couple O
of O
other O
bags O
because O
it O
was O
big O
enough O
to O
grow O
with O
me O
. O

i O
think O
i O
want O
a O
2nd O
one O
in O
new O
color O
now O
... O
buy O
it O
! O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
set O
up O

However O
it O
has O
done O
a O
good O
job O
so O
far O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
name O
product O
this O
will O
not O
dissatisfy O
-- O
this O
is O
it O
. O

I O
think O
the O
wiring O
must O
have O
come O
loose O
from O
its O
connection O
. O

The O
device O
also O
acts O
as O
an O
FM O
receiver O
, O
so O
I O
set O
up O
all O
my O
FM O
stations O
within O
Media O
Center O
and O
can O
now O
listen O
to O
my O
favorite O
FM O
stations O
on O
the O
laptop O
. O

Mouse O
is O
exclusively O
right O
handed O
. O

The O
bottom O
layer O
is O
a O
little O
thicker O
than O
I O
've O
seen O
but O
it O
gets O
not O
more O
than O
warm O
after O
hours O
of O
use O
. O

While O
I O
wish O
it O
were O
made O
of O
a O
little O
bit O
thicker O
material O
, O
it O
did O
a O
great O
job O
of O
protecting O
my O
new O
notebook O
computer O
until O
my O
new O
case O
arrived O
. O

On O
windows O
7 O
you O
can O
see O
an O
amazing O
difference O
between O
vista O
it O
runs O
so O
much O
smoother O
and O
gives O
an O
accurate O
battery O
level O
and O
time O
estimates O
. O

Plugged O
into O
the O
slot O
and O
added O
my O
two O
Western O
Digital O
external O
Hard O
drives O
, O
the O
drives O
light O
up O
but O
do O
not O
show O
in O
My O
Computer O
. O

About O
a O
week O
ago O
, O
I O
installed O
Window O
Words O
XP O
onto O
this O
netbook O
because O
I O
need O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
library O
to O
do O
some O
research O
. O

The O
information O
on O
line O
did O
not O
make O
this O
clear O
and O
even O
indicated O
that O
it O
worked O
everywhere O
. O

It O
is O
perfect O
for O
use O
on O
furniture O
, O
but O
if O
you O
use O
it O
on O
your O
lap O
, O
as O
I O
do O
, O
you O
need O
something O
under O
it O
. O

I O
stopped O
travelling O
with O
laptops O
last O
year O
because O
they O
are O
just O
too O
big O
to O
lug O
around O
the O
globe O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
fairly O
simple O
tasks O
I O
do O
on O
the O
road O
. O

lasts O
about O
two O
hours O
, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
just O
enough O
. O

It O
runs O
well O
when O
it O
runs O

But O
initially O
connecting O
to O
it O
has O
been O
a O
pain O
. O

I O
purchased O
a O
more O
durable O
bag O
for O
carrying O
. O

I O
paid O
for O
a O
device O
that O
I O
used O
one O
time O
, O
so O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

So O
, O
to O
be O
fair O
, O
I O
'm O
giving O
it O
4 O
stars O
-- O
since O
some O
techical O
folks O
may O
be O
aware O
of O
faults O
that O
escaped O
me O
. O

You O
can O
get O
use O
to O
it O

A O
' O
boom O
box O
' O
circa O

Any O
laptop O
over O
$ O
100 O
should O
have O
a O
properly O
backlit O
keyboard O
. O

Video O
- O
The O
screen O
is O
nice O
and O
bright O
, O
but O
lacks O
contrast O
. O

This O
is O
very O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
even O
to O
the O
19-inch O
LCD O
I O
had O
previously O
. O

It O
has O
a O
pearlized O
finish O
that O
seems O
less O
prone O
to O
showing O
scratches O
than O
a O
clear O
cover O
would O
be O
. O

( O
wo O
n't O
work O
well O
as O
a O
back O
scratcher O
) O
. O

The O
case O
fits O
very O
snug O
and O
tight O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
wanted O
, O
and O
protects O
the O
unit O
from O
getting O
scratches O
. O

I O
had O
to O
take O
my O
laptop O
almost O
totally O
apart O
. O

There O
was O
just O
enough O
room O
for O
my O
charger O
, O
notebook O
, O
iPhone O
, O
keys O
, O
pens O
and O
an O
exterior O
slot O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
purse O
for O
loose O
paperwork O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
's O
my O
eyes O
or O
lag O
or O
not O
being O
used O
to O
the O
LED O
screen O
. O

so O
I O
added O
the O
second O
power O
cable O
provided O
plugged O
into O
a O
5 O
volt O
USB O
wall O
wart O
. O

This O
one O
is O
lighter O
and O
covering O
looks O
solid O
. O

First O
off O
, O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

This O
does O
not O
work O
well O
for O
me O
, O
who O
tends O
to O
leave O
the O
laptop O
on O
a O
bed O
, O
or O
couch O
, O
or O
blankets O
, O
as O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
laptop O
has O
no O
space O
to O
relieve O
the O
heat O
and O
gets O
unbearably O
hot O
. O

Small O
enough O
you O
can O
leave O
it O
in O
a O
laptop O
or O
desktop O
USB O
port O
, O
did O
I O
mention O
price O
, O
no O
reason O
to O
pay O
more O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
mine O
came O
with O
a O
cracked O
glass O
in O
the O
lower O
right O
hand O
corner O

so O
you O
have O
to O
open O
and O
close O
the O
lid O
once O
again O
and O
that O
will O
make O
the O
screen O
turn O
on O
. O

I O
custom O
ordered O
mine O
from O
their O

with O
512 O

RAM O
and O
upgraded O
5400 O
RPM O

( O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
it O
nice O

It O

Given O
the O
cost O
of O
this O
item O
I O
would O
not O
have O
returned O
it O
if O
I O
had O

Still O
trying O

out O
how O
to O

up O

my O

I O
'll O
look O

If O
I O

it O
would O

can O
anyone O

This O

The O

-- O
you O
can O
play O

by O
examining O
the O

I O
guess O
that O
it O
being O
stable O
and O
such O
is O
good O
as O
you O
'll O
NEVER O
have O
a O
USB O

accidentally O
fall O
out O

but O
I O
feel O
like O
after O
several O
years O
I O
might O

NOTE O
- O
A O
couple O
of O
days O
after O
posting O
the O
review O
below O

Now O
it O
's O
with O
the O
main O
system O
now O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
gorgeous O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
looking O
around O
but O
this O
is O
the O
best O
looking O
for O
my O
taste O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
. O

It O
is O
multi O
- O
touch O
, O
for O
what O
it O
's O
worth O
. O

In O
front O
of O
that O
can O
go O
a O
few O
more O
things O
( O
chargers O
, O
snacks O
, O
small O
things O
) O
but O
that O
's O
it O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
worked O
, O
and O
I O
needed O
it O
fast O
. O

I O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
layout O
even O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
. O

Good O
quality O
, O
speedy O
delivery O
! O

It O
allows O
for O
more O
precise O
filing O
, O
and O
by O
disconnecting O
them O
when O
not O
in O
use O
, O
it O
also O
saves O
wear O
and O
tear O
on O
the O
drive O
. O

I O
use O
this O
to O
connect O
to O
a O
ViewSonic O
24 O
" O
monitor O
and O
it O
works O
great O
using O
Apple O
's O
Thunderbolt O
port O
on O
the O
Air O
. O

Oh O
and O
the O
short O
throw O
distance O
means O
I O
can O
ceiling O
mount O
it O

I O
use O
my O
Mac O
Pro O
, O
3 O
. O
0gHz O

For O
the O
price O
, O
it O
is O
awesome O
. O

Oh O
well O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
/ O
need O
to O
use O
the O
jack O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
. O

but O
it O
work O
great O

6 O
" O
screen O
protector O
, O
however O
I O
'm O
looking O
for O
one O
that O
covers O
the O
frame O
along O
with O
a O
hole O
for O
the O
camera O
. O

Less O
than O
satisfactory O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

It O
had O
to O
carry O
plenty O
of O
equipment O
. O

Doing O
some O
research O
i O
came O
across O
a O
long O
thread O
on O
the O
Pi O
forums O
. O

As O
it O
is O
, O
the O
open O
style O
helps O
give O
the O
bag O
a O
sophisticated O
look O
but O
does O
little O
to O
offer O
confidence O
. O

But O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
where O
this O
thing O
really O
shines O
: O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

Finally O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
bag O
there O
is O
a O
pocket O
that O
is O
made O
to O
put O
over O
a O
suitcase O
handle O
to O
make O
getting O
through O
airports O
easier O
. O

I O
can O
use O
an O
online O
compiler O
, O
watch O
video O
, O
do O
my O
usual O
surfing O
, O
etc O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
computers O
, O
Dell O
has O
had O
a O
pretty O
good O
reputation O
for O
" O
build O
quality O
" O
in O
their O
products O
. O

I O
tried O
this O
USB O
OTG O
host O
adapter O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
expected O
, O
but O
nothing O
to O
knock O
a O
star O
off O
and O
even O
desired O
among O
many O
purchasers O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
. O

The O
shoulder O
strap O
could O
have O
had O
a O
shoulder O
pad O
on O
it O
but O
..... O

This O
set O
was O
purchased O
from O
Amazon/ O
Reforger O
, O
as O
used O
, O
like O
new O
. O

When O
I O
went O
looking O
I O
found O
this O
one O
at O
Amazon O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
leaving O
it O
paired O
up O
with O
one O
device O
that O
you O
are O
most O
likely O
to O
use O
on O
a O
continual O
basis O
. O

but O
you O
are O
saving O
$ O
85 O
US O
getting O
it O
here O
. O

The O
keyboard O
and O
screen O
are O
full O
- O
sized O
, O
it O
has O
all O
the O
usual O
ports O
( O
including O
HDMI O
) O
, O
and O
its O
performance O
is O
really O
good O
. O

Very O
ergonomic O
, O
fits O
my O
hand O
like O
a O
glove O
. O

They O
are O
small O
, O
easily O
portable O
, O
and O
provide O
a O
lot O
of O
sound O
for O
devices O
so O
small O
. O

it O
is O
beautiful O
to O
look O
at O
as O
well O
. O

No O
problems O
so O
far O
, O
and O
it O
works O
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
tech O
support O
and O
go O
through O
a O
series O
of O
diagnositics O
to O
determine O
that O
the O
correct O
changes O
I O
had O
made O
previously O
were O
not O
updating O
from O
the O
configuration O
software O
to O
the O
card O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
use O
the O
control O
panel O
to O
use O
this O
speaker O
. O

Cheap O
, O
shoddy O
construction O
. O

The O
battery O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

* O
Bright O
, O
clear O
10 O
. O

Also O
a O
funny O
side O
note O
... O

It O
has O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O
that O
when O
I O
need O
a O
cable O
or O
adapter O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
think O
twice O
, O
and O
just O
head O
directly O
for O
the O
Mediabridge O
listings O
. O

The O
handle O
seems O
to O
be O
sewn O
on O
really O
well O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
entirely O
concerned O
about O
the O
scratches O
and O
finish O
; O
as O
the O
products O
does O
as O
intended O
, O
and O
I O
am O
aware O
of O
the O
power O
limitations O

Having O
the O
power O
shut O
off O
from O
the O
USB O
drive O
does O
not O
work O
for O
me O
. O

With O
my O
latest O
14 O
" O
laptop O
being O
in O
the O
super O
- O
lightweight O
category O
, O
I O
now O
" O
see O
the O
light O
" O
that O
a O
laptop O
really O
should O
as O
small O
and O
light O
as O
possible O
- O
as O
long O
as O
it O
still O
is O
a O
fully O
functional O
computer O
and O
retains O
excellent O
screen O
visibility O
. O

Whoever O
buys O
it O
- O
will O
enjoy O
. O

But O
since O
mine O
looks O
out O
a O
window O
the O
sensor O
does O
n't O
work O
well O
if O
at O
all O
. O

Then O
I O
remembered O
that O
my O
wife O
had O
gone O
into O
the O
house O
to O
get O
something O
and O
had O
her O
phone O
with O
her O
! O

You O
can O
use O
up O
to O
3 O
gigs O
RAM O
with O
32-bit O
Windows O
, O
which O
is O
probably O
fine O
for O
most O
of O
the O
people O
in O
today O
's O
market O
. O

This O
product O
DOES O
NOT O
SUPPORT O
remote O
desktop O
. O

I O
think O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
the O
Envy O
17 O
is O
just O
short O
of O
being O
a O
truly O
great O
system O
- O
If O
they O
fixed O
the O
heating O
issues O
, O
and O
battery O
life O
issues O
( O
both O
would O
improve O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
motherboard O
graphics O
chip O
that O
could O
do O
most O
of O
the O
work O
and O
take O
the O
load O
off O
of O
the O
GPU O

an O

It O
has O
four O
corner O
hold O
on O
the O
Kindle O
and O
the O
holders O
are O
soft O
so O
not O

the O

Stylus O

Compared O
to O
my O
older O
Transformer O
Prime O
keypad O
this O
is O
a O
sleeker O
, O
skinnier O
up O
front O
/ O
same O
thickness O
in O
the O
rear O
like O
a O
wedge O
, O
nicer O
looking O
keypad O

After O
arguing O
that O
this O
was O
n't O
what O
the O
other O
agent O
said O
, O
this O
agent O
agreed O
to O
send O
me O
a O
keyboard O
to O
swap O

Great O
backpack O
for O
computer O
use O
. O

This O
is O
a O
big O
difference O
for O
people O
who O
regularly O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
computing O
away O
from O
a O
power O
outlet O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
result O
. O

There O
is O
no O
sense O
paying O
this O
much O
when O
you O
get O
half O
the O
battery O
they O
claim O
. O

my O
cd O
drive O
stopped O
working O
after O
6 O
months O
, O
slow O
to O
get O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
font O
keeps O
changing O
while O
you O
are O
typing O
........ O

hope O
it O
work O
a O
long O
time O
. O

so O
I O
am O
not O
too O
concerned O
and O
can O
not O
comment O
on O
absolute O
color O
accuracy O
. O

did O
n't O
need O
the O
supplied O
installation O
disc O
, O
just O
plugged O
it O
in O
to O
allow O
PC O
to O
recognise O
& O
install O
software O
to O
read O
& O
presto O
all O
was O
working O
well O
. O

Although O
the O
battery O
and O
hard O
drives O
etc O
are O
not O
as O
easily O
accessible O
to O
replace O
. O

It O
's O
everything O
I O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O

The O
machine O
also O
has O
a O
couple O
of O
USB O
ports O
so O
you O
could O
connect O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
washed O
it O
on O
gentle O
cycle O
/ O
cold O
water O
with O
a O
little O
detergent O
. O

It O
fastens O
to O
the O
bag O
via O
two O
Velcro O
pads O
near O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
happens O
but O
this O
equipment O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
bag O
to O
anyone O
. O

So O
believe O
me O
, O
and O
do O
not O
buy O
this O
' O
notebook O
cooler O
' O

Keep O
in O
mind O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
discovered O
that O
if O
you O
used O
the O
keyboard O
to O
enter O
the O
" O
Control O
- O
A O
" O
shortcut O
, O
it O
would O
select O
all O
emails O

There O
would O
be O
more O
wiggle O
room O
on O
a O
computer O
with O
a O
3 O
cell O
or O
flush O
battery O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
getting O
the O
12 O
g O
ram O

and O
if O
you O
download O
oceanus O
you O
can O
change O
that O
too O
. O

This O
is O
true O
to O
an O
extent O
but O
not O
limited O
to O
these O
two O
players O
. O

i O
picked O
up O
this O
case O
to O
go O
with O
my O
newAcer O
C720 O
Chromebook O
, O
11 O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Does O
not O
lag O
one O
bit O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
it O
will O
hold O
over O
time O
... O

Excellent O
for O
a O
17&#34 O
; O
thick O
gamers O
style O
laptop O
like O
the O
Asus O
GW17 O
. O

It O
is O
better O
( O
more O
L2 O
cache O
memory O
) O
than O
the O
Pentium O
Dual O
Core O
T2330 O
and O
T2310 O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
the O
" O
Welcome O
" O
screen O
no O
longer O
appeared O
on O
startup O
. O

Keeps O
my O
machine O
cool O
.. O

It O
was O
tight O
, O
too O
tight O
. O

So O
after O
i O
put O
this O
in O
after O
fully O
charging O
it O
before O
my O
first O
use O
, O
which O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

Good O
product O
. O

The O
older O
model O
was O
ok O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
feel O
durable O
, O
and O
broke O
a O
couple O
zippers O
within O
months O
, O
so O
I O
was O
a O
little O
hesitant O
about O
this O
one O
. O

I O
got O
this O
because O
I O
use O
both O
Mac O
and O
Windows O
operating O
systems O
and O
this O
device O
claims O
to O
be O
usable O
by O
both O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
found O
out O
that O
there O
is O
a O
major O
conflict O
with O
Atheros O
wifi O
chips O
and O
all O
Cisco O
wireless O
routers O
. O

The O
adapter O
this O
comes O
with O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
plug O
any O
low O
power O
device O
right O
into O
your O
phone O
. O

I O
put O
laptop O
cords O
in O
the O
mesh O
area O
, O
although O
its O
location O
makes O
it O
a O
little O
awkward O
with O
a O
large O
power O
brick O
. O

Bad O
news O
for O
Intel O
, O
Microsoft O
and O
PC O
vendors O
, O
but O
good O
news O
for O
consumers O
. O

I O
received O
this O
mouse O
yesterday O
inserted O
the O
included O
battery O
and O
plugged O
the O
USB O
into O
my O
Windows O
7 O
computer O
. O

This O
tablet O
is O
not O
the O
panacea O
of O
computing O
just O
yet O
- O
but O
that O
is O
mostly O
due O
to O
Windows O
8 O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
small O
speck O
of O
dust O
, O
but O
decided O
to O
let O
it O
be O
. O

Solid O
build O
quality O
and O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
last O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
great O
! O
! O

and O
we O
do O
alot O
of O
web O
surfing O
and O
graffics O
! O

Even O
though O
the O
idea O
behind O
it O
is O
simple O
, O
I O
saw O
many O
other O
companies O
make O
build O
- O
in O
fans O
that O
are O
not O
adjustable O
- O
shame O
. O

Picture O
is O
very O
good O
. O

It O
's O
a O
mini O
- O
USB O
based O
cord O
that O
connects O
to O
the O
speaker O
. O

If O
maybe O
you O
were O
not O
watching O
it O
for O
the O
entire O
first O
1 O
. O
5 O
hours O
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
seen O
the O
message O
at O
the O
end O
of O
Disc O
1 O
before O
the O
reboot O
. O

No O
complaints O
whatsoever O
. O

Going O
into O
the O
purchase O
I O
knew O
I O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
be O
getting O
the O
same O
as O
what O
I O
'd O
get O
from O
the O
Apple O
store O
. O

At O
first O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
beats O
audio O
would O
make O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
through O
the O
speakers O
, O
but O
man O
plug O
in O
a O
good O
pair O
of O
headphones O
or O
speakers O
and O
you O
can O
definitely O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

I O
figured O
they O
could O
not O
be O
any O
worse O
than O
the O
21 O
dollar O
Belkin O
. O

The O
driver O
CD O
& O
power O
adapter O
were O
included O
& O
easy O
to O
set O
- O
up O
the O
right O
& O
corresponding O
driver O
. O

This O
after O
market O
about O
8 O
months O
. O

Great O
fit O
and O
protection O
of O
my O
netbook O
. O

I O
'd O
previously O
tried O
one O
of O
the O
clear O
blue O
ones O
, O
and O
found O
it O
was O
crap O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
stereo O
cuts O
out O
at O
random O
times O
for O
no O
reason O
at O
all O
. O

Save O
those O
minor O
things O

Fits O
over O
macbook O
snugly O

It O
feels O
light O
, O
that O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

In O
this O
same O
vein O
, O
I O
am O
also O
having O
a O
difficult O
time O
getting O
used O
to O
clicking O
the O
Command O
key O
instead O
of O
the O
CTRL O
key O
for O
keyboard O
shortcuts O
, O
especially O
since O
my O
muscle O
memory O
wants O
to O
press O
the O
key O
that O
's O
in O
the O
control O
key O
position O
on O
the O
Mac O
which O
actually O
happens O
to O
be O
the O
control O
key O
on O
the O
Mac O

but O
its O
hard O
to O
type O
on O
. O

The O
best O
improvement O
by O
far O
was O
adding O
a O
bigger O
processor O
to O
this O
machine O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
carry O
though O
I O
notices O
that O
to O
carry O
it O
on O
one O
shoulder O
I O
have O
to O
use O
only O
one O
shoulder O
strap O
because O
both O
straps O
are O
far O
apart O
( O
for O
ergonomic O
reasons O
) O
that O
makes O
it O
impossible O
to O
group O
together O
on O
one O
shoulder O

This O
cooler O
keeps O
my O
ultrabook O
10c O
degrees O
colder O
than O
it O
was O
before O
I O
had O
it O
. O

This O
was O
perfect O
because O
the O
cord O
points O
& O
# O
34;up&#34 O
; O
the O
wall O
when O
the O
plug O
is O
in O
the O
outlet O
. O

Finally O
after O
banging O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
, O
I O
upgraded O
to O
a O
Tungsten O
, O
but O
the O
IIIc O
is O
great O
for O
anybody O
who O
just O
needs O
basic O
Palm O
functionality O
with O
a O
color O
screen O
. O

On O
this O
battery O
, O
that O
section O
is O
empty O
. O

Sufficient O
padding O
, O
and O
is O
true O
to O
the O
color O
shown O
. O

This O
4-port O
adapter O
is O
roughly O
the O
same O
price O
as O
the O
1-port O
adapter O
at O
my O
local O
electronics O
hobby O
store O
. O

I O
was O
expecting O
more O
from O
this O
mouse O
by O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

Most O
importantly O
the O
proprietary O
plug O
does O
not O
feel O
too O
tight O
or O
loose O
in O
the O
S7 O
slate O
, O
it O
fits O
just O
like O
the O
factory O
charger O
and O
is O
actually O
one O
entire O
cord O
not O
an O
adapter O
on O
an O
adapter O
. O

I O
love O
the O
way O
this O
key O
board O
snaps O
into O
place O
and O
then O
will O
fold O
over O
screen O
to O
cover O
and O
put O
away O
. O

I O
can O
see O
this O
creasing O
or O
damaging O
the O
flap O
over O
time O
. O

13-inch O

Not O
only O
do O
I O
always O
know O
where O
my O
phone O
is O
, O
it O
lets O
me O
charge O
it O
when O
I O
can O
get O
it O
to O
sit O
correctly O
. O

Had O
to O
replace O
theDVD O
drive O
. O

Just O
check O
out O
the O
competition O
; O
from O
paper O
sleeves O
to O
knockoffs O
you O
can O
immediately O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

but O
I O
'm O
thinking O
it O
's O
the O
media O
and O
not O
the O
player O
. O

Just O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
it O
works O
. O

So O
, O
again O
, O
in O
this O
case O
, O
YMMV O
, O
and O
you O
may O
never O
have O
problems O
with O
this O
. O

1 O
sets O
I O
've O
listened O
to O
, O
and O
I O
love O
the O
form O
factor O
. O

I O
was O
told O
by O
my O
daughter O
that O
I O
was O
& O
# O
34;stupid&#34 O
; O
for O
spending O
so O
much O
time O
on O
a O
PC O
just O
to O
make O
it O
run O
, O
when O
most O
of O
that O
& O
# O
34;run O
stuff&#34 O
; O
is O
taken O
care O
of O
by O
Apple!. O

It O
stopped O
working O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
power O
supply O
and O
not O
the O
actual O
converter O
. O

and O
did O
I O
mention O
the O
ability O
to O
use O
BLUETOOTH O
if O
you O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
use O
the O
built O
in O
keyboard O
for O
all O
day O
use O
? O

The O
first O
time O
was O
a O
recall O
from O
Dell O
. O

The O
markings O
on O
it O
are O
not O
very O
clearly O
visible O
, O
much O
less O
distinguish O
between O
them O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
guess O
where O
they O
are O
. O

In O
this O
configuration O
, O
the O
indicated O
speed O
in O
the O
nav O
software O
kept O
jumping O
from O
0 O
. O
0 O
to O
0 O
. O
5 O
knots O
. O

and O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
the O
item O
, O
but O
as O
far O
as O
performance O
, O
it O
is O
limited O
by O
the O
hardware O
. O

My O
main O
use O
for O
this O
is O
on O
an O
HP O
15 O
. O

Very O
nice O
and O
compatible O
with O
most O
stuff O
. O

w/ O
fresh O
batteries O
and O
w/ O
AC O
adapter O
. O

My O
only O
complain O
is O
the O
touchpad O
for O
mouse O
. O

Navigation O
is O
very O
accurate O
, O
the O
lane O
support O
is O
great O
and O
acquiring O
a O
satellite O
connection O
is O
done O
in O
a O
very O
short O
moment O
. O

No O
Need O
for O
additional O
power O
supply O
needs.[+ O
] O

The O
screen O
went O
dark O
and O
would O
n't O
come O
back O
on O
. O

I O
took O
my O
laptop O
outside O
and O
tried O
the O
Intel O

When O
you O
turn O
the O
remote O
back O
on O
again O
it O
takes O
4 O
- O
5 O
seconds O
and O
it O
is O
connected O
again O
and O
ready O
to O
send O
commands O
. O

I O
plugged O
in O
my O
second O
monitor O
, O
and O
Windows O
7 O
made O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
configure O
it O
as O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
desktop O
. O

and O
I O
'll O
likely O
be O
without O
it O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

The O
battery O
information O
reported O
by O
the O
camcorder O
stated O
that O
it O
was O
a O
class O
2 O
card O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
label O
on O
the O
card O
. O

We O
ended O
up O
returning O
it O
. O

Oddly O
, O
it O
works O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
touchscreen O
often O
. O

This O
is O
for O
a O
2 O
gb O
memory O
set O
for O
a O
Dell O
5150 O
. O

This O
product O
worked O
so O
well O

I O
was O
shocked O
at O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
low O
range O
. O

I O
really O
appreciate O
that O
the O
speakers O
have O
a O
very O
balanced O
and O
natural O
sound O
. O

The O
factory O
battery O
that O
had O
come O
with O
my O
Asus O
laptop O
had O
reached O
the O
end O
of O
its O
useful O
life O
. O

THIS O
IS O
A O
GREAT O
SET O
FOR O
OTHER O
ELECTRONIC O
ITEMS O

It O
looks O
like O
it O
trips O
more O
during O
the O
rain O
or O
when O
conditioner O
is O
running O
. O

It O
still O
works O
fine O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
, O
since O
I O
've O
washed O
it O
, O
I O
've O
had O
no O
data O
integrity O
problems O
. O

The O
wifi O
detector O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O
-- O
my O
roommate O
( O
who O
has O
a O
cheaper O
laptop O
) O
always O
gets O
internet O
at O
our O
apartment O
, O
whereas O
mine O
disappears O
and O
grows O
faint O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
netbook O
off O
of O
hp O
. O

I O
love O
my O
cats O
, O
but O
I O
was O
getting O
tired O
of O
the O
fur O
and O
paw O
- O
dust O
collecting O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

Packaged O
in O
frustration O
free O
packaging O
. O

I O
usually O
sleep O
with O
the O
phone O
on O
airplane O
mode O
, O
but O
occasionally O
I O
like O
to O
turn O
my O
phone O
completely O
off O
when O
I O
sleep O
( O
I O
know O
, O
think O
of O
the O
junk O
emails O
I O
may O
be O
missing O
! O
! O
! O
) O
. O

The O
only O
shortcoming O
is O
that O
because O
of O
the O
structure O
, O
it O
's O
bulky O
if O
you O
're O
only O
carrying O
a O
few O
items O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
boot O
up O
, O
the O
screen O
is O
not O
very O
responsive O
, O
the O
space O
for O
apps O
is O
low O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
junk O
apps O
... O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
very O
good O
; O
I O
have O
n't O
really O
gotten O
to O
test O
if O
it O
gets O
the O
advertised O
9 O
hours O
though O
. O

They O
arrived O
several O
hours O
before O
the O
scheduled O
time O
and O
I O
had O
to O
rush O
home O
from O
the O
store O
- O

Not O
bad O
but O
made O
the O
laptop O
unsteady O
when O
deployed O
, O
larger O
than O
they O
need O
to O
be O
, O
I O
had O
to O
remove O
. O

The O
express O
keys O
are O
slightly O
tilted O
, O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
locate O
the O
one O
you O
want O
without O
looking O
. O

Either O
way O
, O
it O
's O
really O
nice O
to O
not O
have O
a O
spinning O
drive O
, O
and O
liberating O
to O
use O
a O
laptop O
without O
having O
to O
constantly O
worry O
about O
how O
much O
you O
're O
moving O
the O
computer O
and O
wondering O
if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
damage O
the O
drive O
. O

I O
even O
managed O
to O
work O
in O
my O
Nexus O
7 O

GOOD O
ANYWHERE O

Even O
at O
high O
levels O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
go O
for O
about O
8 O
hours O
before O
needing O
to O
recharge O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
comfortable O
that O
it O
will O
provide O
adequate O
protection O
, O
and O
intend O
to O
carry O
it O
as O
my O
only O
case O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
dissapointed O
, O
as O
I O
wanted O
to O
like O
this O
product O
... O
if O
it O
fit O
, O
and O
worked O
well O
, O
and O
was O
durable O

Finding O
the O

not O
so O
easy O

I O
can O
use O
this O
with O
both O
my O

I O
use O
it O

I O

This O

a O
great O

Key O

excellent O
and O
the O

are O
very O

I O
then O
tried O
the O

on O
all O
the O

guess O
what O
, O
excellent O

. O

I O
bought O
two O
of O
them O
for O
my O
twin O
sons O
for O
their O

The O
cords O
plugged O
in O
include O
an O

, O
an O

cable O
, O
a O
USB O
cable O
and O
somehow O
, O
those O
cables O
tipped O
the O

again O
. O

I O
started O
using O
the O
cord O
in O
April O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
it O
's O
very O
well O
made O

I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
after O
only O
an O
hour O
that O
my O
charge O
light O
went O
off O

com O
, O
and O

I O
've O
done O
it O
to O
my O
satisfaction O
now O
, O
and O
will O
call O
Corsair O
RMA O

. O

So O
I O
guess O
the O
thin O
plastic O
is O
also O
no O
big O
problem.(5 O
) O

I O
love O
this O
bag O
. O

and O
you O
're O
ready O

I O

the O

are O
very O
" O
spunky O
, O
" O
and O
will O
be O
a O
fun O
weekend O
case O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
of O
course O
GPS O
does O
n't O
work O
to O
even O
say O
anything O
. O

also O
i O
am O
very O
eager O
to O
try O
meego O
in O
place O
of O
windows O
7 O
starter O
, O
but O
not O
anytime O
soon O
. O

There O
are O
several O
online O
resources O
to O
successfully O
install O
windows O
xp O
or O
ubuntu O
. O

This O
one O
did O
not O
even O
work O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
, O
, O
software O
has O
all O
kinds O
of O
incompatibility O
issues O
! O

They O
are O
easy O
to O
install O
; O
they O
are O
modern O
looking O
and O
most O
importanly O
are O
able O
to O
deliver O
a O
high O
quality O
sound O
. O

Actually O
do O
a O
much O
better O
job O
than O
a O
few O
notebook O
coolers O
I O
own O
. O

BUT O
... O
I O
've O
unfortunately O
found O
the O
product O
unusable O
. O

Great O
replacement O
. O

I O
would O
purchase O
this O
again O
. O

Still O
better O
than O
average O
for O
the O
price O
paid O
- O
for O
a O
combination O
of O
mp3 O
player O
and O
clock O
/ O
alarm O
. O

That O
may O
be O
a O
good O
( O
or O
even O
the O
best O
) O
way O
to O
go O
but O
those O
folks O
know O
a O
lot O
more O
about O
this O
subject O
than O
I O
do O
, O
that O
not O
a O
beginner O
level O
set O
- O
up O
. O

yes O
mines O
is O
working O
wonderful O
. O

The O
benefits O
of O
this O
adapter O
so O
outweigh O
that O
small O
limitation O
that O
I O
still O
say O
it O
's O
a O
5-star O
product O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
me O
, O
Asus O
did O
the O
warranty O
service O
despite O
the O
voided O
warranty O
. O

The O
company O
shipped O
the O
system O
quickly O
and O
it O
arrived O
the O
day O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
. O

Tried O
this O
with O
a O
laptop O
and O
a O
tablet O
& O
# O
8211 O
; O
connected O
without O
even O
trying O
and O
the O
stream O
was O
perfect O
; O
did O
not O
drop O
a O
single O
frame O
. O

3 O
. O
0 O
, O
I O
tested O
the O
read O
and O
write O
speed O
for O
a O
5 O
. O

The O
seller O
was O
Amazon O
. O

Perfect O
for O
those O
using O
NetFlicks O
or O
other O
online O
movie O
sources O
. O

Already O
referred O
this O
product O
/ O
company O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
would O
normally O
wait O
a O
while O
before O
posting O
observations O
, O
but O
decided O
I O
can O
always O
come O
back O
and O
bottom O
- O
box O
it O
if O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
a O
shoddy O
product O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
obviously O
adds O
weight O
and O
bulk O

but O
I O
'm O
not O
very O
far O
from O
the O
device O
, O
so O
it O
ca O
n't O
really O
be O
a O
distance O
issue O
. O

Simply O
tapping O
the O
touchpad O
is O
an O
alternative O
, O
but O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
for O
everything O
( O
like O
dragging O
and O
dropping).Currently O
the O
netbook O
's O
disply O
is O
off O
and O
the O
video O
is O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
22 O
" O
LCD O
at O
full O
native O
resolution O
. O

so O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
judge O
the O
battery O
's O
overall O
life O
. O

Works O
for O
what O
it O
's O
for O
: O
calibrating O
screens O
. O

Another O
highly O
significant O
upgrade O
is O
in O
the O
tablet O
's O
rear O
cover O
design O
, O
which O
has O
been O
altered O
to O
allow O
for O
better O
GPS O
, O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
, O
and O
Bluetooth O
performance O
. O

Contact O
support O
and O
says O
they O
will O
send O
a O
free O
correct O
tip O
. O

It O
has O
bluetooth O
capabilities O
, O
so O
you O
can O
leave O
the O
connecting O
cable O
at O
home O
. O

The O
mouse O
does O
not O
have O
that O
matte O
finish O
, O
its O
just O
a O
shiny O
plastic O
- O
y O
black O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
little O
carrying O
case O
that O
came O
with O
mine O
was O
sort O
of O
misshapen O
, O
with O
a O
huge O
" O
lump O
" O
in O
the O
back O
where O
the O
carrying O
loop O
is O
. O

Not O
just O
any O
carrying O
handle O
, O
but O
a O
rubberize O
handle O
with O
plenty O
of O
width O
for O
my O
extra O
large O
sized O
hand O
- O
swollen O
knuckles O
and O
all O
. O

What O
good O
is O
a O
transportable O
friendly O
laptop O
if O
they O
give O
you O
no O
way O
to O
lock O
it O
down O
temporarily O
while O
on O
the O
go O
? O

In O
the O
next O
month O
i O
am O
going O
to O
upgrade O
the O
Hard O
Disk O
to O
the O
Seagate O
Momenus O
XP O
which O
is O
500 O
G O
with O
a O

G O
SSD O
like O
memory O
build O
in O
. O

I O
added O
the O
soft O
boxes O
to O
the O
Sima O
lights O
to O
remove O
the O
harshness O
. O

Waiting O
for O
this O
thing O
for O
almost O
a O
month O
because O
it O
was O
from O
Japan O
. O

If O
you O
travel O
out O
of O
the O
country O
, O
you O
know O
that O
keeping O
your O
passport O
secure O
is O
a O
top O
priority O
. O

It O
could O
be O
a O
little O
harder O
on O
the O
top O
right O
side O
, O
but O
that O
's O
ok O
... O
just O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
to O
open O
doors O
with O
the O
laptop O
inside O

they O
have O
about O

Stay O

This O

Price O
is O
also O
very O
good O
well O
packaged O
. O

Attempts O
to O
repair O
it O
failed O
utterly O
, O
so O
I O
used O
it O
for O
a O
while O
with O
the O
broken O
plastic O
digging O
into O
the O
right O
side O
of O
my O
head O
and O

with O

I O
bought O

but O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O

to O
anyone O

did O
when O
new O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
this O
is O
a O
no O

Awesome O
product O
. O

that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
, O
it O
's O
an O
abnormally O
tiny O
ultrabook O

It O
took O
a O
while O
to O
fine O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

It O
boots O
up O
faster O
than O
anything O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
, O
save O
for O
Android O
or O
iOS O

Toshiba O

at O
an O
affordable O

and O
it O
might O
be O
the O
computer O
jack O

fault O
, O
in O
which O
case O
i O
would O
say O
4 O
stars O

It O
works O
with O
my O
desktop O
and O
in O
my O
laptop O
flawlessly O
. O

That O
being O

I O
used O

Worked O

no O

, O
clamped O

and O
that O
was O
the O
total O

We O
used O
it O
almost O
every O
day O
to O
charge O
both O
of O
our O

plus O
a O
mobile O

how O
quickly O
it O
charges O
it O
's O
not O
a O

A O

performs O
well O

Wow O
, O
it O
works O
very O
well O
, O
better O
than O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O

for O

totally O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
way O
to O
organize O
your O

batteries O
, O
then O
look O
no O
further O
. O

If O
it O
's O
says O
it O
will O
work O
on O
110/220 O
, O
you O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
two O
of O
these O

retun O
to O
home O

. O

I O
put O
it O
through O
its O
paces O
. O

is O
the O
black O
webbing O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
backpack O
- O
by O
putting O
a O
monopod O
in O
there O
and O
tightening O
the O
ropes O
, O
you O
can O
use O
it O
to O
mount O
an O
external O
flash O
( O
useful O
for O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
flash O
bracket O
or O
find O
yourself O
often O
changing O
from O
vertical O
/ O
horizontal O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
adjust O
the O
flash O
/ O
bracket O
each O
time O
) O
. O

Who O
needs O
to O
mess O
with O
that O
stuff O
-- O
this O
is O
just O
like O
putting O
a O
thumb O
drive O
on O
thru O
the O
USB O
port O
-- O
I O
just O
bought O
my O
second O
one O
. O

It O
is O
still O
working O
to O
this O
day O
. O

Fortunately O
I O
purchased O
the O
extended O
warranty O
from O
Best O
Buy O
. O

Also O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
key O
strokes O
would O
either O
repeat O
itself O
for O
several O
times O
, O
or O
missing O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
bad O
if O
you O
're O
keeping O
it O
as O
a O
permanent O
connection O
, O
but O
is O
a O
little O
annoying O
for O
me O
. O

It O
works O
great O
-- O
and O
if O
you O
handle O
with O
a O
little O
care O
it O
will O
last O

A O
premium O
price O
for O
something O
that O
is O
way O
below O
average O
reliability O
and O
performance O
. O

These O
little O
things O
have O
really O
helped O
me O
organize O
my O
desk O
and O
keep O
my O
cords O
tidy O
. O

The O
lights O
all O
light O
up O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
as O
blue O
as O
the O
pic O
. O

I O
love O
the O
way O
the O
Apple O
shows O
through O
the O
case O
when O
in O
use O
. O

All O
I O
do O
is O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
the O
genius O
bar O
( O
online O
with O
an O
app O
) O
. O

A O
little O
over O
a O
year O
later O
the O
laptop O
display O
failed O
and O
I O
filed O
a O
claim O
with O
Squaretrade O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
to O
connect O
to O
a O
PC O
. O

Contacted O
Amazon O

had O
me O

had O
me O

Charges O
just O
as O
fast O
as O
original O

I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
I. O
T. O
work O
and O
this O
involves O
more O
laptops O
than O
desktops O
by O
far O
. O

Purchased O
to O
use O
with O
netbook O
( O
Gateway O
LT2102 O
) O
and O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

Keeps O
the O
heat O
away O
from O
my O
lap O
and O
provides O
a O
nice O
solid O
base O
for O
the O
laptop O
. O

When O
I O
recieved O
the O
product O
it O
was O
well O
packaged O
. O

When O
I O
researched O
this O
product O
, O
it O
was O
$ O
50 O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
, O
I O
am O
VERY O
pleased O
. O

School O
starts O
back O
Monday O

August O
19th O
, O
so O

My O
first O
Bluetooth O
keyboard O
for O
the O
iPad O
was O
the O
actual O
Apple O
product O
. O

and O
I O
have O
an O
extemely O
powerful O
cooling O
pad O
that O
can O
be O
used O
anywhere O
. O

The O
550 O
watt O
Corsair O
power O
supply O
from O
their O
RM O
series O
is O
the O
best O
I O
've O
seen O
yet O
. O

I O
am O
keeping O
the O
two O
i O
got O
( O
one O
for O
my O
daughter).My O
daughter O
thinks O
it O
could O
use O
better O
improvement O
. O

Just O
what O
I O
needed O
: O
small O
, O
tidy O
, O
clear O
sound O
. O

It O
just O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
not O
to O
. O

Hub O
works O
well O
in O
both O
configurations O
. O

( O
cable O
included O
) O
, O
put O
a O
drive O
in O
the O
top O
slot O
and O
switch O
it O
on O
. O

Works O
with O
the O
mobile O
devices O
, O
like O
iphone O
, O
ipad O
and O
surface O
. O

6 O
inch O
screen O
laptop O
fits O
beautifully O
in O
this O
bag O
. O

THIS O
TABLET O
IS O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O

The O
USB O
ports O
can O
be O
used O
as O
chargers O
while O
the O
computer O
is O
charging O
, O
not O
a O
deal O
breaker O
but O
a O
nice O
to O
have O
feature O
. O

Screws O
on O
female O
do O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
secure O
male O
to O
female O
. O

The O
laptop O
has O
performed O
very O
well O
so O
far O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
second O
( O
counterfeit O
) O

I O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
how O
many O
times O
I O
've O
started O
to O
drop O
it O
, O
grabbed O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
case O
and O
it O
held O
my O
ipad O
securely O
inside O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
pretty O
impressive O
for O
such O
a O
small O
computer O
. O

The O
product O
fits O
snugly O
. O

Windows O
7 O
software O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

Despite O
not O
having O
any O
drivers O
included O
, O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
Windows O
7 O
installed O
it O
right O
away O
and O
it O
worked O
first O
time O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

This O
one O
deal O
saved O
me O
the O
price O
of O
the O
Kindle O
, O
when O
I O
bought O
it O
last O
year O
. O

I O
know O
that O
'll O
change O
. O

This O
is O
the O
11&#34 O
; O
version O
of O
the O
other O
13&#34 O
; O
case O
reviewed O
prior O
. O

Kinda O
of O
frustrating O
not O
knowing O
what O
price O
you O
will O
get O
or O
when O
it O
will O
change O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
on O
my O
W510 O
and O
worked O
with O
no O
problem O
. O

No O
problems O
with O
this O
battery O
, O
perfect O
replacement O
, O
It O
fits O
and O
works O
perfectly O
, O
this O
item O
is O
easy O
and O
most O
common O
to O
replace O
. O

I O
soaked O
it O
in O
febreeze O
and O
let O
it O
sit O
to O
air O
out O
for O
24 O
hours O
and O
that O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

but O
wow O
was O
that O
hard O
. O

There O
is O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
all O
I O
want O
to O
carry O
. O

The O
track O
ball O
is O
nice O
while O
working O
on O
stuff O
where O
you O
might O
need O
to O
scroll O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

I O
have O
no O
complains O
with O
free O
OS O
Mavericks O
, O
it O
's O
been O
polished O
and O
my O
Adobe O
CC O
works O
so O
fast O
on O
the O
solid O
- O
state O
drive O
, O
Photoshop O
opens O
in O
less O
than O
two O
seconds O
. O

If O
you O
work O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
laptops O
and O
need O
missing O
screws O
to O
hold O
the O
hard O
drives O
, O
then O
this O
package O
is O
for O
you O
. O

Price O
was O
right O
alsoso O

" O
monitor O
for O
my O
big O
computer O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
good O
quality O
sound O
, O
I O
would O
advice O
against O
buying O
this O
speaker O
. O

Absolutely O
no O
problems O
, O
no O
split O
second O
drops O
kicking O
me O
off O
the O
system O
, O
excellent O
reception O
. O

Now O
the O
volume O
can O
be O
adjusted O
through O
the O
Entertainment O
Console O
or O
general O
volume O
icon O
on O
thee O
startbar O
but O
you O
can O
also O
change O
the O
volume O
through O
the O
attached O
Volume O
controller O
( O
forgot O
to O
mention O
on O
the O
Design O
portion O
of O
the O
review O
) O
along O
with O
muting O
the O
mic O
or O
turning O
it O
on O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

I O
've O
given O
the O
Bamboo O
Touch O
a O
test O
drive O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
'm O
really O
disappointed O
. O

It O
was O
not O
suppose O
to O
ship O
until O
Friday O
, O
but O
it O
shipped O
a O
day O
early O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
never O
need O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
solid O
construction O
, O
I O
am O
not O
scared O
the O
rubber O
will O
scrape O
off O
or O
the O
" O
legs O
" O
will O
break O
, O
as O
happened O
with O
my O
prior O
plastic O
cooler O
. O

The O
screen O
brightness O
and O
clarity O
are O
reduced O
. O

I O
expected O
the O
video O
splitter O
to O
give O
me O
good O
, O
crisp O
images O
on O
both O
but O

No O
noticeable O
vibration O
on O
lap O
, O
nowiggling O
, O
vibrating O
ends O
/ O
sides O
. O

Great O
product O
. O

Charging O
works O
great O
. O

this O
sleeve O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
in O
every O
way O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
problem O
at O
all O
, O
but O
now O
I O
have O
videos O
that O
I O
originally O
imported O
through O
iMovie O
that O
are O
compressed O
, O
I O
saved O
the O
.mts O
files O
to O
my O
hard O
drive O
, O
so O
I O
want O
to O
transfer O
them O
back O
to O
the O
camera O
and O
re O
- O
import O
them O
through O
Final O
Cut O
now O
that O
I O
've O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
do O
that O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
the O
Pixela O
software O
to O
let O
me O
do O
it O
, O
even O
though O
that O
's O
supposedly O
what O
it O
is O
for O
... O

My O
advice O
is O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
card O
if O
you O
have O
a O
Toshiba O
laptop O
. O

It O
sounds O
amazing O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
Y O
- O
cable O
for O
use O
with O
computers O
that O
need O
the O
extra O
connection O
for O
power O
. O

Not O
quite O
as O
fast O
as O
when O
installed O
in O
the O
laptop O
via O
the O
internal O
SATA O
bus O
but O
satisfied O
nonetheless O
. O

I O
recently O
purchased O
the O
Dual O
channel O
HD O
version O
so O
can O
now O
record O
4 O
channels O
at O
same O
time O
( O
converted O
my O
Toshiba O
DVR O
/ O
CD O
Player O
back O
to O
basic O
and O
can O
record O
one O
channel O
there O
if O
I O
wish O
. O
) O

That O
only O
allows O
scratches O
and O
dirt O
. O

Sure O
, O
they O
sound O
OK O
and O
are O
loud O
enough O
( O
much O
louder O
than O
my O
Dell O
Inspiron O
1525 O
at O
that O
) O
, O
but O
they O
still O
could O
be O
a O
little O
better O
. O

The O
sleeves O
outside O
dimensions O
are O
14 O
" O
wide O
x O
10 O
" O
high O
x O
" O
thick O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
, O
while O
not O
living O
up O
to O
the O
hype O
of O
7 O
hours O
does O
easily O
last O
5 O
. O
5 O
hours O
when O
set O
for O
maximum O
battery O
which O
gets O
me O
through O
all O
but O
the O
longest O
flights O
( O
and O
who O
actually O
uses O
a O
computer O
longer O
than O
that O
while O
in O
flight O
? O
) O

I O
recieved O
the O
power O
supply O
on O
Saturday O
and O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
use O
it O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
the O
AC O
power O
cord O
necessary O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
an O
outlet O
. O

so O
I O
am O
going O
to O
keep O
this O
short O
and O
sweet O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
charger O
for O
a O
family O
friend O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
. O

The O
mount O
needs O
work O
, O
but O
it O
stays O
on O
, O
though O
you O
have O
no O
ability O
to O
move O
the O
unit O
once O
it O
is O
on O
the O
windshield O
. O

This O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
holding O
it O
's O
own O
quite O
well O
though O
. O

: O
I O
see O
Amazon O
has O
raised O
the O
price O
for O
this O
item O
about+ O

But O
that O
just O
means O
, O
at O
least O
to O
me O
that O
I O
should O
use O
a O
mouse O
, O
I O
prefer O
to O
do O
it O
that O
way O
anyway O
. O

no O
software O
to O
install O
or O
maintain- O

Bottles O
will O
fall O
out O
of O
it O
and O
some O
plastic O
water O
bottles O
you O
can O
buy O
did O
n't O
even O
fit O
. O

Very O
advanced O
laptop O
. O

brings O
up O
the O
task O
manager O
. O

Construction O
feels O
pretty O
cheap O
. O

I O
was O
dreading O
expecting O
to O
pay O
around O
$ O
50 O
for O
a O
new O
power O
supply O
cord O
, O

It O
came O
in O
today O
, O
and O
I O
was O
quite O
shocked O
at O
how O
good O
it O
looks O
. O

I O
was O
seeing O
my O
connection O
drop O
out O
regularly O
, O
and O
I O
discovered O
that O
this O
was O
a O
common O
complaint O
among O
owners O
of O
these O
devices O
. O

The O
form O
factor O
of O
the O
card O
is O
nice O
. O

so O
i O
got O
this O
and O
boom O
, O
2 O
hours O
more O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
PC O
user O
since O
I O
started O
to O
get O
into O
technology O
18 O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
volume O
and O
screen O
brightness O
controls O
seem O
to O
be O
tightly O
coupled O
with O
a O
Windows O
driver O

A O
full O
- O
width O
hump O
, O
evidently O
holding O
additional O
cells O
, O
sticks O
roughly O
a O
half O
inch O
further O
out O
the O
back O
of O
the O
netbook O
. O

5 O
feet O
away O
( O
I O
found O
this O
better O
than O
the O
specs O
said O
) O
! O

This O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
expecting O
to O
receive O
and O
completely O
in O
good O
conditions O
. O

so O
I O
was O
highly O
surprised O
when O
it O
arrived O
and O
was O
and O
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
. O

That O
my O
not O
seem O
that O
much O
but O

I O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
build O
and O
feel O
. O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
a O
bag O
that O
would O
weigh O
me O
down O
or O
over O
power O
me O
. O

Another O
review O
noted O
the O
hum O
only O
with O
the O
magnetic O
cover O
on O
the O
iPad O
. O

Those O
filters O
are O
useful O
, O
but O
way O
too O
pricey O
for O
me O
. O

pd_ys_qtk_general_recs_1I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
box O
while O
it O
was O
still O
warm O
from O
the O
shipper O
, O
and O
NOTHING O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

The O
keyboard O
was O
too O
tiny O
. O

I O
've O
been O
through O
a O
couple O
backpacks O
since O
starting O
college O
, O
and O
the O
biggest O
problem O
with O
each O
of O
them O
is O
always O
the O
rip O
factor O
. O

The O
NB O
( O
330 O
) O
has O
all O
the O
required O
ports O
as O
well O
as O
Bluetooth O
. O

I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
battery O
that O
would O
replace O
my O
dying O
one O
in O
my O
inspiron O
1545 O
. O

Chrome O
browser O
responds O
very O
quickly O
. O

i O
will O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
who O
's O
trying O
to O
improve O
sound O
quality O
from O
their O
laptop O
's O
Built O
in O
speakers O
. O

My O
only O
real O
annoyance O
with O
Samsung O
is O
the O
model O
numbering O
on O
the O
Q1 O
ultra O
series O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
metal O
part O
came O
unsoddered O
from O
the O
board O
then O
slipped O
out O
, O
so O
now O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
and O
I O
only O
had O
it O
two O
weeks O
. O

This O
cord O
works O
great O
with O
my O
Asus O
tf101 O
eee O
pad O
. O

I O
think O
a O
17 O
" O
MacBook O
Pro O
" O
might O
" O
be O
pushing O
it O
. O

The O
mode O
that O
translates O
writing O
to O
text O
could O
be O
better O
. O

We O
all O
know O
how O
over O
priced O
some O
accessories O
can O
be O
, O
and O
how O
frustrating O
it O
can O
be O
to O
find O
a O
3rd O
party O
equivalent O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O

I O
was O
hoping O
for O
a O
kind O
of O
surround O
sound O
effect O
, O
but O
did O
not O
achieve O
it O
. O

At O
the O
risk O
of O
overlap O
, O
I O
'll O
cover O
the O
basics O
: O
It O
's O
got O
a O
nice O
big O
glossy O
16:9 O
screen O
. O

But O
my O
only O
critic O
about O
the O
hardware O
is O
that O
the O
right O
- O
shift O
shares O
its O
area O
with O
the O
up O
- O
arrow O
, O
and O
the O
number O
0 O
for O
the O
number O
pad O
is O
too O
small O
. O

I O
purchased O
an O
Airport O
Express O
and O
connected O
it O
to O
my O
2WIRE O
through O
their O
ethernet O
ports O
and O
the O
MacBook O
now O
connects O
wirelessly O
to O
the O
Airport O
Express O
without O
problems O
. O

130 O
Mpbs O
were O
achieved O
, O
compared O
to O
65 O
Mpbs O
with O
my O
Linksys O
PCMCIA O
slot O
Wireless O
N O
adapter O
. O

X. O
One O
thing O
I O
did O
find O
-- O
a O
very O
minor O
OS O
X O
system O
glitch O
-- O
was O
my O
" O
Movies O
" O
folder O
was O
not O
recognized O

they O
put O
a O
couple O
pieces O
of O
software O
that O
I O
would O
compare O
to O
bloatware O
which O
I O
immediately O
removed O
upon O
receiving O
it O
. O

But O
, O
for O
my O
mobile O
life O
, O
i. O
e. O
when O
I O
travel O
, O
I O
think O
I O
am O
really O
going O
to O
enjoy O
Windows O
8 O
on O
this O
little O
beauty O
! O

First O
time O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
this O
situation O
. O

Hopeful O
that O
the O
bendable O
areas O
that O
become O
stressed O
on O
cheaper O
cables O
resist O
the O
crackling O
in O
the O
future O
. O

The O
quickest O
exposure O
settings O
are O
for O
1sec O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
will O
fit O
my O
Motorola O
Atrix O
Lapdock O
, O
but O
for O
$ O
2 O
, O
why O
not O
try O
it O
? O

Who O
did O
n't O
assemble O
it O
correctly O
? O

My O
ASUS O
was O
DOA O
and O
it O
was O
a O
rather O
bad O
experience O
..... O

In O
short O
I O
'd O
say O
its O
the O
perfect O
case O
for O
someone O
wanting O
to O
combine O
funcationality O
, O
style O
and O
comfort O
all O
in O
one O
package O
. O

The O
interior O
compartment O
has O
a O
space O
perfectly O
sized O
for O
the O
Surface O
, O
with O
a O
velcro O
strap O
to O
secure O
it O
in O
place O
. O

What O
else O
can O
I O
say O
. O

The O
keyboard O
feels O
very O
flimsy O
. O

I O
would O
have O
also O
purchased O
the O
larger O
version O
for O
my O
Apple O
Laptop O
, O
but O
it O
appeared O
that O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
too O
big O
for O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

The O
Dolby O
control O
panel O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
adjustments O
and O
enhancements O
. O

At O
first O
thought O
it O
was O
too O
small O
to O
get O
comfortable O
with O
but O
after O
using O
it O
for O
awhile O
find O
it O
most O
excellent O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
above O
mentioned O
this O
is O
an O
addition O
I O
would O
recommend O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
typing O

Excellent O
sound O
for O
the O
size O
. O

I O
've O
only O
seen O
the O
ones O
that O
come O
with O
chargers O
but O
my O
point O
remains O
. O

( O
until O
they O
really O
break O
new O
ground).In O
addition O
, O
Logitech O
has O
added O
a O
small O
remote O
( O
1 O
" O
X O
3 O
" O
) O
that O
controls O
the O
On O
/ O
Off O
, O
volume O
, O
sound O
source O
( O
iTunes O
/ O
computer O
) O
and O
Play O
/ O
Advance O
, O
but O
its O
gimmicky O

However O
, O
for O
some O
people O
that O
may O
hot O
be O
an O
option O
or O
even O
desirable O
. O

and O
it O
turns O
on O
the O
TV O
and O
the O
Theatre O
System O

Very O
happy O
with O
the O
case O
& O
the O
Ultra O
that O
fits O
inside O
. O

Better O
than O
any O
tablet O
. O

I O
think O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
tabs O
, O
as O
mentioned O
in O
another O
review O
, O
are O
made O
to O
hold O
the O
cards O
in O
place O
securely O
during O
shipping O

The O
hard O
drive O
can O
not O
be O
replaced O
. O

I O
like O
how O
they O
are O
shaped O
like O
little O
alien O
sea O
creature O
things O
. O

Considering O
all O
the O
features O
and O
quality O
of O
this O
set O
I O
am O
surprised O
it O
is O
not O
more O
expensive O
. O

It O
's O
not O
bad O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
great O
either O
. O

Other O
than O
those O
two O
minor O
points O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
little O
burst O
of O
sound O
for O
the O
money O
! O

However O
, O
you O
can O
just O
download O
an O
extension O
that O
acts O
as O
a O
screenshot O
button O
, O
except O
with O
WAY O
more O
features O
than O
the O
normal O
PRINT O
SCREEN O
button O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
it O
not O
backward O
compatible O
with O
Blue O
Tooth O
2 O
. O
1 O
( O
as O
indicated O
) O
, O
but O

If O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
to O
do O
basic O
tasks O
and O
some O
complicated O
ones O
that O
will O
last O
for O
a O
while O
( O
4 O
years O
at O
least O
) O
, O
this O
is O
the O
computer O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
. O

They O
are O
no O
frills O
, O
so O
no O
extra O
pockets O
or O
anything O
, O
but O
they O
are O
of O
surprisingly O
high O
quality O
. O

so O
i O
do O
nt O
recommend O
messin O
with O
the O
softwae O
that O
coes O
prloaded O
on O
your O
laptop O
, O
the O
p2tv O
did O
a O
fiirmware O
update O
automatically O
and O
thankfuly O
everything O
worked O
ok O
after O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
cable O
to O
link O
your O
data O
to O
your O
Kindle O
Fire O
this O
is O
the O
one O
for O
you O
. O

The O
mouse O
goes O
to O
sleep O
after O
a O
time O
, O
and O
there O
's O
a O
button O
on O
top O
to O
wake O
it O
up O
again O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
getting O
a O
little O
bit O
noise O
( O
sound O
to O
me O

Linux O
and O
xUbuntu O
. O

Could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

It O
is O
an O
exact O
replacement O
for O
a O
cracked O
screen O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
, O
easy O
to O
carry O
, O
easy O
to O
open O
and O
show O
in O
security O
check O
area O
in O
airports O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
Coolmax O
compact O
enclosures O
for O
some O
time O
and O
now O
decided O
to O
move O
up O
to O
the O
USB O
3 O
since O
i O
just O
got O
the O
card O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

They O
have O
known O
about O
the O
problem O
for O
over O
a O
year O
& O
have O
done O
nothing O
about O
rather O
they O
claim O
it O
is O
user O
fault O
. O

Has O
an O
easy O
storage O
for O
the O
cord O
. O

Some O
genius O
removed O
the O
start O
button O
and O
the O
power O
button O
put O
it O
to O
sleep O
, O
so O
I O
googled O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
thing O
. O

work O
without O
them O
both O
. O

It O
worked O
right O
away O
and O
was O
able O
to O
upscale O
the O
video O
to O
1280x800 O
. O

I O
find O
this O
very O
annoying O
as O
we O
can O
buy O
things O
on O
Amazon O
. O

The O
performance O
is O
amazing O
, O
the O
solid O
state O
drive O
gets O
him O
up O
and O
running O
on O
the O
drop O
of O
a O
dime O
. O

So O
far O
I O
have O
tested O
out O
the O
battery O
pack O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
works O
how O
I O
want O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
glasses O
with O
anti O
- O
glare O
coatings O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Not O
much O
to O
say O
about O
a O
product O
which O
does O
exactly O
what O
it O
was O
created O
to O
do O
except O
that O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
... O

I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
buy O
one O
several O
times O
at O
a O
very O
reduced O
rate O
when O
Circuit O
City O
was O
going O
out O
of O
business O
, O
but O
I O
blew O
it O
off O
thinking O
I O
would O
never O
need O
one O
. O

, O
I O
see O
now O
that O
they O
carefully O
only O
mention O
that O
the O
AC O
- O
outlet O
is O
surge O
protected O
. O

It O
breathes O
enough O
to O
accommodate O
large O
items O
and O
has O
enough O
pockets O
to O
slip O
needful O
stuff O
into O
. O

Now O
the O
13 O
" O
model O
feels O
like O
hot O
and O
heavy O
dead O
weight O
-- O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
simply O
have O
no O
interest O
in O
using O
it O
. O

The O
key O
press O
pressure O
is O
very O
soft O
and O
it O
seems O
like O
keystrokes O
sometimes O
do O
not O
register O
unless O
you O
press O
the O
keys O
dead O
center O
. O

The O
next O
time O
, O
though O
, O
I O
smelled O
burning O
plastic O
. O

I O
may O
have O
extended O
the O
life O
of O
my O
laptop O
by O
a O
couple O
years O
. O

So O
yes O
, O
it O
's O
going O
back O

3 O
" O
and O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

5 O
MONTHS O
LATER O
, O
AM O
HAVING O
PROBLEMS O
WITH O
USB O
PORTS O
; O
INTERMITTENT O
CONNECTIONS O
. O

I O
use O
this O
every O
day O
for O
work O
! O

I O
would O
add O
a O
case O
because O
the O
model O
zipper O
may O
scratch O
the O
mac O
if O
you O
are O
not O
careful O
. O

Buy O
it O
if O
you O
want O
a O
well O
made O
laptop O
backpack O
that O
can O
hold O
all O
your O
gear O
and O
be O
comfortable O
too O
. O

I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
to O
try O
out O
and O
review O
the O
C2 O
G O
Gables O
to O
Go O
Indoor O
/ O
Outdoor O
Bluetooth O
Speaker O
. O

Fantastic O
device O
! O

these O
are O
all O
3rd O
party O
adapters O
, O
so O
I O
feel O
I O
'm O
always O
taking O
a O
risk O
. O

and O
it O
barely O
shows O
any O
wear O
, O
despite O
daily O
use O
. O

There O
is O
n't O
much O
to O
this O
product O
, O
so O
the O
price O
seems O
a O
little O
high O
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
sleep O
option O
so O
when O
not O
in O
use O
it O
will O
FADE-- O

Until O
about O
10 O
uses O
in O
and O
then O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
it O
no O
longer O
works O
. O

and O
they O
would O
repair O
it O
and O
return O
it O
to O
me O
. O

and O
then O
the O
usb O
with O
internet O

It O
also O
has O
zipper O
pockets O
for O
cables O
and O
chips O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
sound O
quality O
as O
much O
as O
the O
picture O
quality O
, O
but O
you O
can O
always O
plug O
in O
an O
external O
speaker O
set O
, O
or O
route O
it O
through O
a O
sound O
system O
. O

Love O
the O
extra O
speed O
for O
the O
good O
price O
. O

It O
runs O
like O
an O
angel O
. O

Also O
I O
have O
noticed O
an O
extreme O
cooling O
of O
my O
laptop O
. O

Once O
the O
lid O
was O
closed O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
open O
as O
the O
screen O
side O
lid O
would O
protrude O
and O
reduce O
the O
gap O
used O
to O
open O
in O
general O
case O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
find O
time O
to O
send O
it O
back O
right O
away O
due O
to O
the O
holidays O
and O
the O
computer O
sat O
on O
my O
desk O
. O

For O
the O
EXACT O
same O
price O
, O
you O
can O
find O
the O
i7 O
processor O
on O
Best O
Buy O
! O

It O
is O
too O
small O
for O
most O
laptops O
, O
but O
should O
fit O
most O
e O
- O
readers O
and O
netbooks O
as O
well O
as O
an O
iPad O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
tried O
other O
features O
yet O
. O

I O
installed O
, O
formatted O
and O
installed O
software O
. O

I O
've O
had O
countless O
emails O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
tech O
support O
and O
are O
still O
waiting O
to O
hear O
back O
from O
them O
... O
replacements O
came O
, O
one O
of O
the O
two O
was O
defective O
, O
created O
a O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
and O
my O
mouse O
driver O
stopped O
working O
... O
worked O
great O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
and O
died O
out O
of O
nowhere O

I O
just O
chalked O
it O
up O
to O
needing O
a O
good O
cleaning O
of O
the O
cache O
, O
etc O
. O

It O
created O
hardware O
problems O
even O
after O
the O
upgrade O
adviser O
said O
my O
computer O
was O
compatible O
. O

I O
have O
used O
them O
for O
daily O
basis O
for O
two O
months O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

all O
work O
just O
fine O
with O
the O
new O
Macbook O
. O

Microfiber O
cloth O
works O
great O
and O
a O
big O
bonus O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
in O
class O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
hear O
the O
fan O
. O

I O
understand O
that O
the O
pricing O
was O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
, O
but O
at O
least O
they O
should O
advertise O
that O
you O
are O
not O
getting O
a O
new O
battery O
! O

It O
always O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Write O
them O
for O
any O
questions O
you O
might O
have O
regarding O
which O
mouse O
to O
buy O
. O

Very O
nice O
TV O
and O

You O
place O
your O
laptop O
on O
it O
, O
plug O
it O
into O
a O
USB O
port O
, O
and O
that O
's O
it O
. O

My O
flip O
from O
2001 O
takes O
better O
video O
. O

On O
the O
go O
with O
few O
compromises O
from O
a O
larger O
Notebook O
with O
all O
the O
gadget O
in O
a O
heavy O
bag O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
is O
excellent O
, O
much O
better O
than O
most O
bluetooth O
speakers O
. O

We O
paid O
about O
$ O
4 O
for O
it O
, O
and O
I O
bought O
2 O
more O
just O
to O
have O
them O
for O
when O
I O
need O
them O
. O

May O
want O
to O
consider O
before O
buying O
HP O
Pavilion O
laptops O
. O

First O
his O
product O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
good O
enough O
to O
not O
bulk O
up O
the O
laptop O
and O
make O
closing O
and O
opening O
the O
cover O
shell O
difficult O
. O

Turn O
on O
the O
bluetooth O
on O
your O
device O
, O
press O
the O
power O
button O
on O
this O
unit O
( O
in O
between O
the O
two O
volume O
buttons O
) O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
( O
you O
will O
hear O
an O
audible O
sound O
) O
and O
keep O
holding O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
seconds O
until O
you O
hear O
another O
sound O
, O
which O
is O
the O
bluetooth O
pairing O
mode O
. O

It O
boots O
to O
the O
desktop O
in O
about O
15 O
seconds O
. O

I O
got O
accessories O
like O
the O
58 O
mm O
Mennon O
Lens O
Hood O
, O
and O
the O
DM-50 O
microphone O
attachment O
( O
for O
the O
mini O
canon O
advancment O
shoe O
) O
and O
sunpack O
7575 O
fluid O
head O
tripod O
.. O

I O
bought O
this O
tablet O
for O
my O
mom O
. O

The O
connectors O
are O
solid O
and O
appropriately O
stiff O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
last O
issue O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
adapter O
puts O
off O
much O
more O
heat O
than O
the O
stock O
adapter O
. O

There O
is O
no O
support O
for O
Skype O
, O
however O
, O
this O
is O
a O
google O
computer O
, O
so O
you O
will O
need O
a O
G O
mail O
account O
which O
means O
you O
can O
use O
Google O
Hangouts O
to O
video O
chat O
, O
I O
actually O
like O
it O
better O
than O
skype O
. O

Now O
with O
this O
MacBook O
Air O

Would O
buy O
it O
again O
. O

The O
Dell O
Venue O
Pro O
11 O
with O

I O
had O
a O
spare O
monitor O
at O
home O
so O
after O
some O
research O
on O
the O
web O
, O
discovered O
all O
I O
needed O
was O
an O
HDMI O
to O
DVI O
Adapter O
cable O
. O

Adapter O
works O
just O
perfect O
. O

A O
prime O
example O
of O
" O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
" O
which O
in O
this O
case O
is O
just O
what O
I O
got O
, O
nothing O
. O

Compact O
when O
closed O
and O
the O
light O
is O
pleaseant O
and O
ample O
. O

but O
I O
have O
n't O
yet O
tested O
this O
. O

The O
problems O
ranged O
from O
the O
Dell O
only O
connecting O
at O
54 O
Mbps O
to O
the O
media O
software O
on O
one O
of O
the O
Androids O
setting O
it O
up O
to O
hardware O
accelerate O
which O
caused O
video O
playback O
not O
to O
have O
sound O
. O

Very O
easy O
to O
set O
- O
up O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
expensive O
but O
totally O
worth O
it O
for O
an O
Imac O
27 O
" O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
HP O
continued O
with O
ruggedized O
shells O
, O
as O
it O
is O
much O
better O
than O
plastic O
and O
it O
looks O
very O
nice O
; O
very O
professional O
. O

It O
is O
poorly O
constructed O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

If O
i O
needed O
to O
buy O
another O
adapter O
( O
for O
any O
windows O
machine O
) O
I O
would O
grab O
one O
of O
these O
again O
. O

Seller O
was O
on O
time O
and O
quick O
. O

Larger O
than O
life O
, O
even O
. O

the O
computer O
will O
be O
fine O
. O

Just O
realize O
that O
most O
color O
prints O
are O
3 O
. O
5 O
x O
5 O
and O
larger O
ones O
are O
4 O
. O
5 O
x O
6 O
; O
these O
PoGos O
are O
2 O
x O
3 O
, O
so O
they O
're O
about O
half O
the O
size O
of O
th O
small O
prints O
you O
get O
at O
the O
store O
. O

This O
adapter O
really O
boosts O
my O
wifi O
signal O

My O
old O
bamboo O
had O
just O
died O
, O
and O
that O
poor O
thing O
had O
had O
a O
rough O
life O
. O

I O
pair O
this O
with O
the O
CaseCrown O
Tidal O
Sleeve O
Case O
for O
protection O
in O
a O
backpack O
for O
Campus O
use O
and O
it O
's O
great O
and O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

For O
those O
with O
less O
gear O
there O
are O
smaller O
backpacks O
like O
theTimbuk2 O
Sleuth O
Camera O
Backpack O
, O
though O
they O
may O
be O
more O
expensive O
. O

Battery O
Life O
is O
really O
really O
good O
. O

I O
have O
two O
cameras O
and O
4 O
len O
's O
and O
all O
the O
chargers O

I O
've O
since O
moved O
this O
dongle O
to O
two O
different O
Windows O
7 O
64 O
bit O
systems O
. O

Eliminates O
wear O
on O
all O
the O
connectors O
because O
everything O
is O
connected O
by O
way O
of O
a O
dedicated O
socket O
on O
the O
underside O
. O

It O
's O
not O
like O
it O
only O
happens O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

It O
protects O
the O
aluminum O
MAC O
cover O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
is O
not O
indicative O
of O
a O
language O
barrior O
resulting O
in O
much O
email O
stress O
. O

But O
I O
have O
a O
PC O
open O
with O
my O
work O
and O
my O
Macbook O
open O
for O
my O
writing O
. O

This O
product O
is O
amazing O
. O

The O
repairman O
confirmed O
my O
concern O
that O
the O
replacement O
boards O
tend O
to O
blow O
within O
a O
year O
or O
so O
, O
as O
well O
. O

I O
installed O
it O
in O
5 O
minutes O
. O

Well O
, O
imho O

if O
someone O
tries O
to O
break O
in O
they O
have O
to O
move O
the O
plant O
and O
it O
sets O
off O
the O
alarm O
. O

So O
I O
guess O
Dell O
has O
blown O
off O
the O
commercial O
market O
for O
this O
model O
, O
since O
you O
ca O
n't O
output O
video O
to O
a O
projector O
or O
large O
monitor O
to O
show O
a O
presentation O
or O
hook O
it O
up O
to O
a O
wired O
internet O
or O
intranet O
system O
. O

Its O
easy O
to O
see O
whose O
Mac O
Book O
is O
whose O
with O
the O
bold O
colors O
. O

One O
worked O
well O
, O
the O
other O
not O
so O
much O
. O

It O
is O
good O
memory O
for O
your O
computer O
abilities O
. O

But O
it O
really O
does O
seem O
like O
a O
very O
good O
amp O
. O

The O
female O
end O
is O
snug O
and O
should O
n't O
disconnect O
randomly O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
physical O
design O
of O
the O
camera O
, O
and O
the O
packaging O
was O
very O
consumer O
friendly O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
endorse O
a O
product O
that O
lies O
in O
the O
description O
like O
this O
. O

At O
640 O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
solid O
choice O
. O

I O
own O
a O
TDK O
A33 O
, O
which O
moves O
around O
the O
same O
price O
range O
( O
price O
has O
been O
fluctuating O
in O
Amazon O
) O
and O
even O
though O
larger O
than O
this O
one O
is O
almost O
the O
same O
as O
practical O
, O
it O
is O
also O
sturdier O
and O
has O
a O
better O
output O
sound O
( O
bass O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
Mipow O
Boomax O
) O

Style O
- O
this O
is O
one O
nice O
looking O
bag O
. O

This O
ipod O
dock O
/ O
speaker O
is O
a O
great O
desktop O
addition O
. O

Four O
days O
after O
Amazon O
agreed O
that O
the O
description O
is O
wrong O
it O
is O
still O
not O
corrected O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
've O
upgraded O
to O
a O
D600 O
with O
a O
70 O
- O
300 O
mm O
telephoto O
, O
it O
's O
way O
tighter O
. O

About O
16 O
- O
17 O
hours O
, O
which O
is O
almost O
not O
heard O
of O
with O
other O
tablets O
. O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
extra O
USB O
ports O
then O
buy O
a O
USB O
hub O
. O

Trying O
the O
PowerLine O
two O

splitter O
plus O
usb O
now O
. O

I O
use O
this O
Macbook O
sometimes O
for O
hours O
on O
ends O
daily O

and O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
can O
find O
another O
use O
for O
it O
... O

To O
double O
click O
, O
you O
tap O
twice O
. O

Ships O
with O
faulty O
firmware O
. O

It O
charges O
well O
. O

Same O
goes O
for O
A O
/ O
V O
dongle O
. O

Just O
Enough O
Storage O
, O
and O
very O
lightweight O
. O

Kids O
want O
Apps O
Nabi O
, O
and O
lots O
of O
them O
! O

So O
of O
course O
it O
wo O
n't O
install O
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
verification O
by O
the O
installer O
THAT O
it O
installed O
. O

I O
do O
like O
the O
security O
feature O
of O
using O
the O
handle O
to O
put O
under O
the O
table O
so O
that O
thieves O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
snatch O
it O
as O
easily O
. O

Without O
it O
, O
I O
find O
myself O
shifting O
my O
hands O
to O
an O
awkward O
position O
or O
I O
end O
up O
shifting O
the O
laptop O
. O

Double O
Entry O
Accounting O
: O
I O
thought O
this O
was O
going O
to O
get O
me O
, O
but O
I O
found O
a O
free O
, O
cloud O
- O
based O
app O
on O
the O
Chrome O
Web O
Store O
. O

What O
to O
do O
with O
all O
those O
memory O
cards O
! O

I O
play O
Star O
Wars O
Battlefront O
II O
and O
get O
maybe O
25 O
FPS O
average O
with O
low O
settings O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
OK O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
most O
expensive O
cooling O
mat O
, O
it O
still O
managed O
to O
overheat O
. O

As O
of O
this O
writing O
, O
I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
over O
a O
week O
and O
have O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
connecting O
several O
different O
types O
of O
devices O
. O

and O
it O
's O
performing O
flawlessly O
. O

Hi O
Definition O
Notebook O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
's O
so O
impressive O
, O
with O
outstanding O
performance O
, O
utility O
, O
standard O
features O
, O
software O
, O
and O
has O
hardware O
packaging O
that O
is O
2nd O
to O
none O
in O
this O
price O
range O
of O
c.$1250+/- O
notebooks O
, O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
wait O
to O
put O
it O
in O
perspective O
, O
compared O
to O
other O
" O
media O
center O
" O
notebooks O
. O

Anyway O
the O
deal O
is O
that O
this O
cooling O
base O
is O
awesome O
, O
but O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
improvements O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
concerning O
the O
stand O
. O

because O
of O
glossy O
screen O
( O
hate O
reflections O
) O
, O
4 O
GB O
ram O
limit O
( O
at O
the O
time O
of O
purchase O
) O
and O
limited O
storage O
options O
chose O
X220 O
and O
have O
been O
pretty O
satisfied O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
LOADED O
with O
bloatware O
. O

The O
Page O
Up O
/ O
Down O
keys O
are O
above O
the O
numeric O
keypad O
-- O
way O
out O
of O
reach O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
menu O
switching O
feature O
that O
uses O
three O
or O
four O
finger O
gestures O
to O
switch O
between O
multiple O
windows O
and O
applications O
. O

As O
others O
have O
said O
, O
these O
caps O
stay O
on O
better O
than O
the O
stock O
Canon O
lens O
cap O
. O

The O
color O
was O
brighter O
than O
expected O
but O
it O
does O
its O
job O

My O
son O
got O
a O
new O
computer O
when O
he O
started O
high O
school O
and O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
bag O
. O

but O
there O
was O
a O
warning O
that O
the O
Snow O
Leopard O
drivers O
did O
not O
work O
. O

Macbook O
Pros O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
20 O
! O

This O
one O
arrived O
very O
quickly O
and O
works O
great O
! O

( O
These O
days O
all O
modern O
computers O
use O
PCIe O
, O
not O
PCI.)I O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
disappointed O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
post O
this O
early O
review O
to O
help O
anyone O
with O
activation O
problems O
. O

but O
downgraded O
the O
Hard O
Drive O
, O
Touch O
, O
4 O
GB O
, O
/ O
one O
of O
the O
better O
CPU O
/ O
APU O
options O
in O
this O
category O
for O
gaming O
( O
Portal O
2 O
and O
Torchlight O
2 O
on O
high O
settings O
but O
lag O
free O
! O

It O
charges O
the O
speaker O
more O
quickly O
and O
lets O
me O
charge O
it O
anywhere O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Creative O
Zen O
Micro O
Photo O
and O
I O
looped O
the O
same O
song O
to O
hear O
the O
difference O
in O
quality O
. O

It O
even O
comes O
with O
an O
extra O
boost O
of O
power O
cord O
( O
5 O
volt O
) O
just O
in O
case O
it O
jitters O
during O
playback O
.. O
it O
works O
on O
my O
lap O
top O
too O
. O

Better O
than O
my O
Canon O
5D O
still O
camera O
, O
shame O
on O
Canon O
! O

However O
, O
for O
my O
purpose O
of O
light O
portability O
for O
travel O
with O
adequate O
storage O
space O
, O
this O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
need O
. O

It O
's O
funny O
comparing O
this O
to O
a O
simple O
portable O
laptop O
like O
the O
Acer O
( O
which O
does O
a O
great O
job O
for O
what O
I O
use O
it O
for O
) O
and O
the O
aging O
desktop O
. O

The O
price O
/ O
value O
ratio O
on O
this O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
.. O
nor O
does O
anything O
come O
close1st O
setting O
is O
flat O
EQ O
with O
a O
nice O
clean O
boost O
.. O

I O
purchased O
this O
ultrabook O
as O
an O
alternative O
to O
my O
gargantuan O
HP O
laptop O
that O
I O
use O
for O
work O
. O

It O
boots O
to O
Windows O
7 O
in O
less O
than O
15 O
seconds O
. O

The O
RAM O
upgrade O
has O
not O
appreciably O
improved O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
computer O
and O
at O
random O
times O
it O
takes O
considerable O
time O
to O
boot O
up O
. O

I O
think O
I O
underestimated O
the O
time O
it O
would O
take O
to O
install O
it O
into O
my O
EeePC O

The O
connection O
to O
my O
local O
home O
network O
was O
easy O
, O
and O
transfer O
speeds O
were O
excellent O
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
widgets O
that O
show O
you O
power O
saving O
vs. O
performance O
settings O
and O
there O
are O
function O
keys O
to O
control O
the O
same O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
huge O
Amazon O
fan O
and O
this O
is O
the O
only O
problem O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
with O
them O
. O

USB O
driven O
external O
hard O
drive O
. O

Wish O
my O
laptop O
had O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O

The O
keyboard O
does O
have O
a O
very O
shallow O
key O
travel O
, O
but O
this O
does O
not O
bother O
me O
. O

, O
I O
should O
have O
gone O
with O
a O
touch O
screen O
; O
that O
is O
my O
only O
regret O
. O

But O
I O
do O
like O
the O
Dell O
Latitude O
Laptop O
allot O
. O

The O
replacement O
works O
fine O
. O

It O
arrived O
today O
, O
set O
it O
up O
, O
and O
looks O
way O
better O
than O
the O
Toshiba O
( O
minus O
the O
built O
in O
DVD O
player O
, O
but O
I O
recently O
purchased O
a O
PS3 O
and O
the O
" O
older O
" O
bluray O
player O
has O
moved O
into O
the O
bedroom O
) O
. O

2 O
) O
Make O
sure O
you O
have O
a O
Windows O
disk O
so O
you O
can O
run O
the O
" O
repair O
" O
option O
without O
repurchasing O
. O

Still O
strong O
. O

I O
started O
using O
a O
27 O
inch O
AOC O
at O
work O
that O
I O
got O
for O
cheap O
. O

The O
unit O
's O
case O
is O
made O
of O
a O
rather O
cheap O
feeling O
plastic O
, O
and O
the O
door O
to O
the O
bay O
would O
not O
close O
reliably O
. O

I O
stick O
with O
four O
stars O
because O
I O
wish O
it O
did O
have O
a O
backlit O
keyboard O
, O
so O
you O
can O
take O
my O
rating O
with O
that O
grain O
of O
salt O
. O

It O
is O
nice O
& O
sturdy O
. O

Got O
it O
on O
time O
... O

Simple O
TV O
site O
finally O
recognized O
my O
unit O
! O

Horrible O
, O
did O
n't O
work O
as O
it O
said O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
possible O
for O
someone O
using O
the O
chromebook O
to O
expand O
the O
size O
of O
an O
application O
window O
so O
far O
that O
he O
ca O
n't O
close O
the O
window O
. O

It O
only O
improved O
the O
sound O
quality O
of O
my O
Sennheiser O
HD598 O
and O
Grado O
SR80 O
maybe O
about O
5 O
% O
. O

Overall O
the O
keyboard O
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
company O
is O
great O
! O

Got O
this O
for O
a O
co O
worker O
. O

I O
can O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
except O
those O
who O
do O
most O
of O
their O
iPad O
use O
in O
portrait O
orientation O
. O

drives O
little O
more O
than O
half O
full O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
set O
for O
my O
new O
laptop O
after O
I O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quickly O
getting O
scratched O
up O
. O

The O
upgrades O
going O
to O
N O
are O
substantial O
, O
with O
a O
higher O
# O
of O
channels O
, O
dual O
band O
, O
and O
easy O
setup O
. O

the O
price O
was O
great O
compared O
to O
the O
$ O
85 O
that O
dell O
wanted O
too O
charge O
me O
. O

no O
problems O
, O
super O
great O
signal O
. O

works O
great O
! O

The O
design O
is O
actually O
pretty O
sleek O
. O

It O
indexes O
each O
video O
' O
segment O
' O
as O
a O
thumbnail O
making O
it O
easy O
to O
review O
any O
segment O
and O
even O
delete O
that O
segment O
if O
one O
desires O
. O

it O
just O
kinda O
annoying O
having O
to O
invert O
he O
left O
and O
right O
multiple O
times O
during O
a O
movie O
. O

I O
tried O
several O
and O
returned O
many O
but O
found O
this O
bag O
fit O
the O
surface O

I O

With O

I O
would O
not O
use O

The O
forum O
that O
helped O
me O
out O
was O
[ O
... O
] O
- O
but O
the O
site O
seems O
to O
be O
down O
for O
a O
bit O
. O

I O
can O
see O
a O
musician O
composing O
on O
the O
pages O
while O
humming O
or O
singing O
along O
while O
the O
pen O
records O
it O
all O
. O

And O
having O
purchased O
and O
installed O
it O
, O
the O
adapter O
has O
lived O
up O
to O
all O
my O
expectations O
. O

I O
posted O
a O
long O
review O
of O
the O
current O
crop O
of O
DV6 O
- O
21xx O
series O
of O
notebooks O
here O
: O

For O
the O
past O
two O
months O
I O
am O
struggling O
with O
the O
wireless O
connector O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

Buying O
the O
original O
charger O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
16 O
GB O
of O
memory O
for O
your O
laptop O
- O
this O
is O
for O
you O
. O

I O
had O
also O
downloaded O
PDF O
995 O
, O
PDF O
995 O
converter O
, O
PhotoScape O
, O
Irfanview O
, O
and O
CCleaner O
, O
and O
these O
also O
survived O
. O

But O
I O
still O
appreciate O
the O
value O
of O
these O
speakers O
because O
of O
the O
tiny O
amount O
of O
space O
it O
takes O
up O
, O
the O
good O
quality O
sound O
, O
the O
ease O
of O
use O
, O
and O
the O
portability O
factor O
. O

My O
exact O
laptop O
model O
is O
HP O
Pavilion O
DV9999US O
. O

When O
its O
time O
to O
choose O
your O
IP O
address O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
log O
into O
your O
router O
and O
poke O
around O
to O
find O
the O
DHCP O
range O
. O

Had O
an O
issue O
about O
a O
program O
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
it O
without O
the O
licensing O
documentation O

I O
can O
charge O
it O
in O
the O
case O
as O
well O
. O

My O
short O
run O
from O
Cablestogo O
of O
the O
same O
idea O
, O
though O
only O
6 O
" O
long O
is O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
on O
the O
RGB O
end O
, O
using O
cable O
clamps O
and O
actual O
adapters O
rather O
than O
three O
wires O
heat O
shrinked O
to O
the O
end O
. O

An O
odd O
nearly O
2:1 O
aspect O
ratio O
on O
screen O
which O
reduces O
its O
at O
first O
gloss O
largeness O
utility O
as O
headers O
and O
footers O
eat O
up O
too O
much O
vertical O
space O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
run O
the O
laptop O
with O
this O
battery O
now O
, O
is O
to O
constantly O
be O
plugged O
in O
. O

The O
lag O
went O
from O
about O
half O
a O
second O
to O
the O
2 O
seconds O
that O
another O
review O
had O
posted O
. O

Also O
, O
you O
can O
use O
a O
three O
- O
prong O
plug O
and O
the O
more O
common O
two O
prong O
USA O
plug O
. O

I O
am O
absolutely O
happy O
about O
this O
purchase O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
whether O
this O
will O
be O
something O
I O
use O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
, O
but O
it O
is O
unique O
, O
very O
cute O
and O
it O
serves O
a O
technological O
purpose O
. O

Yes O
I O
am O
anal O
! O

They O
replied O
right O
away O
with O
& O
# O
34;no O
problem O
your O
new O
one O
will O
ship O
tomorrow&#34;. O

Also O
excellent O
shipping O
. O

Almost O
as O
simple O
has O
plugging O
in O
a O
usb O
drive O
. O

I O
find O
it O
cumbersome O
to O
remove O
the O
dock O
all O
the O
time O
so O
my O
original O
case O
needed O
replacing O
. O

As O
another O
has O
mentioned O
, O
this O
is O
a O
slightly O
different O
version O
than O
the O
& O
# O
34;old&#34 O
; O
one O
. O

No O
software O
needed O
for O
special O
keys O
, O
like O
volume O
control O
. O

so O
I O
would O
say O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
to O
get O
a O
better O
quality O
. O

i O
love O
the O
9 O
inch O
screen O
+ O
size O
, O
it O
only O
weighs O
2 O
. O

Relatively O
inexpensive O
when O
compared O
to O
other O
computers O
with O
similar O
capabilities O
. O

The O
price O
is O
a O
little O
steep O
, O
but O
still O
reasonable O
. O

It O
may O
just O
be O
an O
issue O
with O
Macs O
and O
bluetooth O
( O
had O
the O
same O
issue O
with O
a O
bluetooth O
mouse O
) O

Pros O
- O
Very O
reflective O
screen O
. O

Very O
good O
quality O
. O

Found O
this O
enclosure O
case O
for O
about O
$ O
5 O
. O
00 O
and O
some O
change O
with O
free O
shipping O
from O
China O
. O

I O
have O
just O
recently O
switched O
over O
to O
Mac O

: O
I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
problems O
with O
the O
wireless O
card O
before O
I O
made O
my O
purchase O
, O
as O
I O
found O
an O
unsettling O
large O
amount O
of O
complaints O
online O
about O
Samsung O
's O
wireless O
card O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
toss O
this O
case O
down O
a O
hill O
with O
my O
laptop O
in O
it O
, O
but O
for O
everyday O
bumps O
and O
scuffs O
it O
does O
the O
trick O
. O

Once O
opened O
, O
connect O
your O
PS3 O
controller O
to O
your O
computer O
using O
the O
same O
USB O
cable O
you O
use O
to O
charge O
your O
controller O
with O
your O
PS3 O
. O

I O
received O
several O
calls O
from O
Sony O
informing O
me O
of O
the O
current O
repair O
status O
while O
it O
was O
gone O
( O
very O
unexpected O
) O
. O

The O
inner O
pocket O
is O
a O
really O
nice O
addition O
. O

There O
are O
commercial O
systems O
out O
there O
too O
for O
more O
than O
a O
few O
hundred O
dollars O
. O

I O
recently O
got O
my O
ASUS O
Eee O
PC O
1005PE O
and O
am O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

I O
have O
an O
old O
RoG O
gaming O
laptop O
that O
had O
serious O
heat O
issues O
but O
this O
little O
guy O
can O
handle O
it O
with O
ease O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
compact O
laptop O
tote O
. O

I O
just O
hooked O
it O
up O
and O
plugged O
in O
the O
devices O
I O
needed O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
without O
fail O
to O
this O
date O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
SandDisk O
. O

Maybe O
I O
will O
update O
this O
post O
in O
5 O
years O
to O
let O
everyone O
know O
how O
it O
is O
holding O
up O
... O
who O
am O
I O
kidding O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

I O
am O
concerned O
that O
the O
zipper O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O

would O
some O
day O
scratch O
the O

, O
I O
know O
it O
will O
degrade O

the O
months O
pass O
and O
if O
it O
is O
under O
what O
I O
would O

It O

proved O
to O
be O
invaluable O
for O

Even O
if O
you O
own O
a O

, O
it O
's O
amazing O
, O
but O
Apple O
likes O
to O
make O
other O
manufacturers O

hardware O
APPEAR O
to O
be O
worse O
than O
theirs O
, O
so O
they O
can O
justify O
their O
stratospheric O
prices O
and O
pump O
up O
their O
profits O
, O
so O
your O
experience O
may O
not O
live O
up O
to O
the O
potential O
of O
this O
impressive O
little O
webcam O
. O

The O

fits O
perfectly O

It O
's O
likely O
that O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
return O

cancel O

After O
a O

I O
destroyed O
the O

drilled O
three O
large O
holes O
in O
the O

I O
usually O
use O

mounted O

I O
think O
the O

This O

does O
the O
trick O
by O

I O
have O
gone O
through O
so O
many O

since O
I O
use O
this O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
commuting O
to O
work O
and O
have O
seen O
them O
all O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
color O
especially O
for O
girls O
and O
a O
must O
buy O
for O
all O
high O
school O
and O
college O
students O
because O
I O
am O
a O
college O
student O
too O
and O
i O
know O
how O
sometimes O
you O
forget O
there O
is O
a O
laptop O
in O
the O
bag O
and O
after O
a O
rough O
day O
just O
fling O
it O
around O
. O

The O
connection O

( O
from O
a O

, O
so O
it O
's O
very O
efficient O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
design O
, O
it O
can O
be O
used O
with O
or O
without O

All O
I O
wanted O
was O
media O
and O
document O
backup O
and O
storage O
that O
I O
could O
access O
remotely O
. O

But O
if O
you O
use O
it O
for O
movies O
I O
thought O
the O
3d O
looked O
pretty O
good O
. O

My O
adpater O
included O
a O
LED O
, O
and O
from O
what O
I O
could O
observe O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

Often O
times O
this O
meant O
not O
actually O
registering O
the O
keystroke O
, O
and O
having O
to O
backspace O
and O
correct O
my O
typing O
frequently O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
this O
case O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
money!(Update O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
case O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
now O
, O
mostly O
when O
I O
am O
doing O
homework O
or O
taking O
notes O
in O

. O

The O
greatest O
risk O
of O
damage O
is O
when O
we O
pull O
the O
case O
out O
of O
our O
other O
bag O
or O
put O
it O
back O
in O
, O
and O
handles O
GREATLY O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
slipping O
and O
dropping O
during O
those O
moments.- O
During O
storage O
at O
home O
, O
I O
will O
separate O
the O
battery O
from O
the O
main O
unit O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
discharge O
, O
and O
the O
side O
slot O
is O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
put O
it O
( O
diagonally).A O
WORD O

If O
your O
computer O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
and O
, O
added O
to O
that O
, O
you O
tend O
to O
carry O
other O
things O
in O
the O
bag O
( O
portable O
hard O
drive O
, O
papers O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
, O
the O
handle O
is O
good O
enough O
only O
to O
move O
or O
position O
the O
bag O
, O
not O
carry O
it O
. O

I O
still O
like O
it O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
find O
something O
better O
out O
there O
, O
definitely O
keep O
looking O
. O

The O
silly O
trackpad O
gestures O
are O
annoying O
when O
they O
get O
in O
the O
way O
, O
which O
is O
often O
, O
and O
useless O
anyway O
, O
but O
they O
are O
easy O
to O
disable O
so O
its O
not O
a O
drawback O
. O

I O
figured O
out O
that O
it O
was O
probably O
just O
that O
the O
signal O
was O
low O
enough O
that O
the O
speaker O
was O
thinking O
there O
was O
n't O
one O
and O
shutting O
off O

So O
the O

is O
essential O
in O

mode O
( O
for O
me O
, O
anyway O
) O
. O

The O
bottom O

is O
that O
I O
wish O
this O
cover O
was O
manufactured O
with O
a O
smoother O
edge O
and O
fit O
slightly O
better O
. O

We O
did O
in O
fact O
invest O
in O
a O
pair O
of O
those O
inexpensive O
popup O
speakers O
which O
helps O
boost O
the O
sound O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

that O
way O
you O
are O
n't O
out O
a O
port O
. O

It O
seems O
like O
the O
perfect O
device O
to O
pair O
with O
a O
pico O
projector O
for O
sales O
presentations O
or O
for O
allowing O
the O
kids O
to O
watch O
videos O
while O
traveling O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
check O
out O
the O
substandard O
chicklet O
keyboards O
offered O
by O
Dell O
and O
others O
. O

Oddest O
yet O
, O
I O
have O
Dish O
network O
with O
the O
Sling O
Player O
built O
in O
. O

These O
had O
no O
discernible O
effect O
on O
performance O
. O

Oh O
No O
, O
is O
it O
worth O
replacing O
? O

Charges O
well O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
got O
quite O
the O
deal O
. O

Meaning O
, O
rather O
than O
go O
thru O
the O
hassle O
of O
buying O
cheap O
and O
wasting O
money O
and O
time O
, O
I O
'm O
gon O
na O
drop O
the O
bucks O
on O
the O
good O
stuff O
and O
be O
done O
. O

Side O
to O
side O
rotation O
which O
breaks O
the O
connection O
is O
simply O
unavoidable O
. O

As O
with O
the O
Acer O
, O
this O
Toshiba O
has O
viewing O
angle O
issues O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
it O
's O
leather O
and O
should O
n't O
be O
wetted O
anyway O
, O
but O
the O
flaps O
do O
leave O
some O
holes O
for O
raindrops O
to O
get O
into O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
painstakingly O
removed O
the O
dividers O
to O
make O
room O
for O
a O
camera O
bag O
, O
pillow O
and O
jacket O
. O

Honeycomb O
has O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
learning O
curve O
and O
it O
needs O
some O
polish O
but O
the O
tab O
is O
still O
really O
good O
. O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
return O
it O
now O
. O

This O
laptop O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
hot O
, O
and O
even O
after O
long O
use O
is O
n't O
burning O
up O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
at O
home O
. O

The O
Amazon O
reviews O
were O
highly O
positive O
( O
thank O
you O
all O
! O
) O
and O
addressed O
some O
of O
my O
concerns O
, O
such O
as O
the O
flex O
of O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
would O
certainly O
think O
about O
getting O
one O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
someone O
that O
I O
thought O
would O
use O
it O
and O
would O
certainly O
recommend O
anyone O
reading O
this O
and O
on O
- O
the O
- O
fence O
to O
get O
it O
and O
remove O
that O
guilt O
for O
ignoring O
their O
stereo O
& O
those O
great O
speakers O
it O
has O
. O

so O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
get O
way O
with O
buying O
the O

week O
with O
company O
and O
they O
immediately O
noticed O
the O
improved O
sound O
quality O
and O
video O
quality O
. O

I O
just O
did O
and O
got O
a O
40 O
% O
off O
code O
. O

When O
I O
first O
unpackaged O
it O
and O
turned O
it O
on O
, O
the O
fan O
was O
screaming O
right O
away O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
camera O
is O
amazing O
compared O
to O
most O
webcams O
. O

No O
thanks O
on O
both O
counts O

My O
computer O
HP O

With O
the O
flash O
memory O
, O
it O
starts O
filming O
very O
quickly O
, O
especially O
when O
compared O
to O
older O
, O
MiniDV O
- O
based O
camcorders O
, O
and O
even O
quicker O
than O
hard O
drive O
camcorders O
since O
there O
are O
fewer O
moving O
parts O

The O
trackpad O
drives O
me O
crazy O
. O

After O
reading O
all O
of O
the O
reviews O
I O
could O
possibly O
find O
about O
this O
Sleekbook O
, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
put O
off O
about O
purchasing O
one O
, O
but O
found O
a O
great O
deal($424 O
plus O
$ O
50 O
rebate O
) O
on O
a O
floor O
model O
at O
another O
vendor O
's O
store O
, O
by O
accident O
. O

I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
MMO O
gaming O
and O
the O
location O
of O
the O
F O
keys O
is O
pretty O
nice O
. O

but O
they O
could O
n't O
resolve O
it O
over O
the O
phone O
. O

The O
usb O
charging O
works O
great O
too O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
which O
is O
extremely O
minor O
was O
the O
power O
supply O
cord O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
fit O
into O
the O
adapter O
at O
first O
. O

and O
you O
know O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
slip O
right O
thru O
your O
fingers O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
hair O
short O
so O
the O
contacts O
didn&#8217;t O
meet O
fully O
once O
installed O
in O
the O
laptop O
. O

it O
feels O
sturdier O
than O
my O
current O
netbook O
's O
case O
& O
that O
has O
held O
up O
fine O
for O
a O
few O
years O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
this O
is O
a O
push O
in O
the O
tablet O
/ O
Chromebook O
showdown O
. O

But O
really O
, O
why O
would O
you O
buy O
a O
battery O
from O
a O
company O
who O
ca O
n't O
accurately O
describe O
what O
you O
're O
buying?***TEXT O

This O
little O
computer O
is O
not O
a O
toy O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
fit O
in O
your O
pocket O
( O
unless O
you O
wear O
cargo O
pants O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
) O
, O
but O
it O
's O
quite O
easy O
to O
take O
along O
for O
whatever O
purpose O
. O

My O
iPod O
is O

Curiously O
the O
keys O
are O
hard O
plastic O
, O
which O
scuffs O
the O
screen O
protector O
every O
time O
I O
close O
it O
against O
the O

too O
hard O
, O
would O
prefer O
the O
keys O
to O
be O
rubbery O
and O
backlit O
similar O
to O
Microsoft O
Surface O
keyboards O
. O

But O
the O
price O
was O
right O
and O
it O
will O
protect O

A O

has O
broken O
out O
and O
the O
& O
# O
34;J&#34 O
; O
mouse O
cover O
came O
off O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
through O
a O
simple O
process O
of O
taking O
some O
pictures O
what O
not O
and O
within O
2 O
weeks O
I O
had O
a O
replacement O
bag O
. O

it O
is O
made O
and O
is O
equipped O
better O
than O
you O
expect O
and O
the O
installation O
could O
n't O
be O
simpler O
. O

I O
use O
them O
mostly O
with O
my O
laptop O
and O
cell O
phone O
. O

My O
daughter O
was O
charging O
her O
chromebook O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
someone O
stepped O
on O
it O
which O
cracked O
the O
screen O
. O

The O
point O
is O
that O
the O
noise O
made O
me O
think O
that O
something O
was O
broken O
in O
there O
or O
about O
to O
be O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
distracting O
. O

Thank O
you O
GC O

The O
computer O
never O
crashed O
, O
but O
it O
made O
game O
playing O
impossible O
. O

When O
i O
inserted O
a O
DVD O
to O
it O
nothing O
again O
. O

Excellent O
product O
! O

I O
had O
read O
some O
of O
the O
other O
buyers O
" O
horror O
" O
stories O
on O
here O
about O
how O
the O
battery O
did O
n't O
work O
with O
their O
computer O
, O
or O
how O
it O
exploded O
. O

No O
glitches O
, O
no O
problems O
. O

What O
this O
means O
for O
me O
is O
that O
where O
my O
thumb O
rests O
is O
closer O
to O
the O
screen O
than O
the O
button O
, O
making O
it O
somewhat O
difficult O
to O
hit O
that O
button O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
a O
speaker O
and O
a O
light O
. O

It O
's O
a O
plus O
that O
the O
netting O
melted O
instead O
of O
also O
bursting O
into O
flames O
, O
as O
that O
would O
have O
made O
a O
bad O
night O
worse O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
provide O
a O
limited O
amount O
of O
protection O
for O
the O
wires O
themselves O
. O

Go O
for O
the O
speed O
! O

I O
like O
the O
dedicated O
internet O
key O
on O
the O
top O
section O
of O
the O
laptop O
bar O
, O
and O
all O
the O
dedicated O
keys O
on O
the O
keyboard O

I O
received O
it O
the O
very O
next O
day O
. O

A O
journey O
on O
Google O
offered O
up O
the O
suggestion O
of O
uninstalling O
IE8 O
to O
solve O
the O
keyboard O
entry O
lagging O
and O
that O
did O
seem O
to O
help O
but O
the O
jury O
is O
still O
out O
on O
that O
one O
... O
As O
far O
as O
the O
HDMI O
connection O
is O
concerned O
: O
One O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
got O
this O
particular O
laptop O
was O
for O
the O
HDMI O
port O
( O
wanted O
to O
watch O
Netflix O
on O
my O
bedroom O
TV O
) O
so O
this O
was O
perhaps O
even O
more O
upsetting O
than O
the O
keyboard O
problem O
and O
warranted O
a O
call O
to O
tech O
support O
. O

Not O
so O
much O
as O
a O
flicker O
out O
of O
it O
on O
my O
Dell O

A O
Dell O
rep O
came O
out O
and O
replaced O
the O
motherboard O
and O
the O
charging O
cord O
. O

There O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
power O
down O

We O
carry O
this O
in O
the O
car O
for O
vacations O
and O
travel O
with O
the O
grandkids O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
protector O
for O
my O
daughter O
its O
great O
, O
she O
loves O
it O

But O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
thing O
to O
have O
for O
most O
times O
in O
cleaning O
. O

I O
almost O
always O
read O
the O
comments O
and O
go O
with O
good O
products O
. O

the O
only O
reason O
i O
am O
giving O
it O
3 O
stars O
is O
because O
it O
does O
work O
in O
other O
items O
i O
need O
to O
charge O

accessing O

would O
be O
great O
if O
you O
live O

wanted O
to O
play O

at O
a O
decent O
volume O
, O
without O
the O

disturbing O
your O
neighbors O
. O

It O
's O
more O
blue O
than O
it O
is O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

For O
old O

and O
for O

this O
is O
the O

it O
wants O
you O
to O
go O
straight O

there O

Once O
again O
, O
this O
is O
not O
really O
a O
deficit O
in O
the O
equipment O
as O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
drawbacks O

fits O
the O

But O
the O
actual O

inside O
the O

This O

I O
overhauled O

to O
the O

by O

their O

I O

have O
been O

I O
read O
the O
other O
reviews O
and O
was O
a O
bit O
skeptical O
of O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
Xoom O
case O
I O
've O
used O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
offer O
camparisons O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O

As O
expected O
, O
after O
hooking O
it O
up O
, O
it O
did O
not O
go O
straight O
to O
charging O
mode O
. O

I O
even O
updated O
my O
router O
's O
firmware O
to O
the O
most O
recent O
build O
, O
and O
still O
a O
no O

go O
on O
my O

The O
portable O
speaker O
comes O
with O
a O
short O
coiled O
audio O
cable O
and O
a O
USB O
charging O
cable O
. O

works O
great O
! O

It O
is O
much O
more O
sturdy O
than O
the O
Targus O
or O
Belkin O
. O

Sturdy O

and O

. O

however O
it O
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
expected O

You O
tend O
to O
use O
your O
laptop O
on O
your O
lap O
when O
you O
are O
out O
and O
about O
. O

So O
this O
is O
n't O
my O
personal O
review O

The O
batteries O
never O
fall O
out O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
much O
stuff O
we O
were O
able O
to O
put O
in O
it O
. O

and O
they O
said O
they O
will O
be O
sending O
the O
new O
one O
in O
5 O

7 O
business O
days O
. O

Good O

. O

i. O
e. O
, O
remove O
the O

) O
, O
otherwise O
they O
cease O
to O
function O
. O

and O
then O
right O
- O
clicking O
to O
use O
it O
, O

I O
'd O
recommend O
this O
computer O
to O
anyone O
except O
gamers O
( O
who O
will O
need O
something O
a O
bit O
faster O
with O
better O
graphics O
) O
but O
for O
a O
college O
student O
, O
high O
school O
student O
, O
or O
working O
stiff O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
choice O
. O

This O
computer O
looked O
like O
new O
but O
it O
had O
been O
modified O
. O

Even O
then O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
loud O
. O

[ O
Update O
: O
this O
has O
stabilized O
over O
time O
with O
further O
updates O

The O
over O
the O
shoudler O

up O
takes O
alittle O
of O

to O
get O
everything O
, O
and O
direction O
of O
access O
, O
set O
the O
way O
you O
would O
want O
it O
. O

It O
's O
definitely O
on O
the O
small O
side O
for O
a O
bag O
that O
can O
fit O
a O
15&#34 O

Stopped O
working O
within O
about O
three O
weeks O

Nicely O

, O
there O
is O
no O
worry O
about O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
battery O
does O
n't O
fit O
properly O
. O

While O
the O
springs O
on O
these O
are O
tense O
, O
one O
side O
broke O
while O
trying O
to O
detach O
the O

Great O

what O
it O
says O

And O
3 O

are O
a O

Got O
the O

I O
first O
tried O
to O

Simple O
scrolling O
with O
a O
mouse O
. O

Sometimes O
by O
just O
spending O
a O
couple O
hundred O
dollars O
more O
will O
make O
a O
tremendous O
difference O
and O
make O
your O
viewing O
more O
enjoyable O
. O

and O
i O
actually O
reach O
for O
my O
chromebook O
instead O
of O
the O
laptop O
for O
most O
everything O
i O
do O
. O

A O
recessed O
release O

pops O
open O
the O
battery O
compartment O
, O
which O
is O
as O
well O
thought O
out O
as O
every O
other O
part O
of O
this O
mouse O
. O

You O
will O
get O
the O
best O
bang O
for O
your O
buck O
! O

It O
really O
makes O
working O
on O
spreadsheets O
a O
bunch O
easier O
. O

I O
may O
pick O
up O
one O
of O
the O
smaller O
Street O
Walker O
series O
bags O
for O
the O
times O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
everything O
and O
the O
kitchen O
sink O
on O
my O
back O
. O

I O
never O
had O
any O
problem O
with O
them O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
corect O
connection O
with O
the O
terminals O
is O
my O
guess O
but O
anyways O
, O
good O
while O
it O
lasted O
. O

This O
is O
a O
feature O
you O
do O
n't O
often O
find O
. O

Would O
not O
use O
it O
for O
overnight O
camping O
/ O
extended O
day O
trips O
as O
those O
activities O
are O
not O
suitable O
for O
this O
pack O
. O

When O
I O
have O
lots O
of O
things O
on O
it O

I O
have O
a O
15 O
inch O
late O
2011 O

pro O
, O
I O
purchase O
this O
sleeve O
to O
provide O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
protection O
when O
I O
carry O
the O
laptop O
without O
a O
bag O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
Canadians O
pay O
so O
much O
more O
for O
flash O
memory O
cards O
, O
this O
card O
is O
twice O
as O
much O
or O
more O
in O
Canadian O
stores O
. O

They O
took O
over O
the O
first O
one O

Liked O
the O
product O
and O
its O
at O
the O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
to O
get O
it O
done O
at O
Apple O
. O

Slim O
and O
lightweight O
. O

Battery O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
put O
out O
too O
wtf O
? O

It O
's O
rare O
today O
to O
find O
such O
great O

up O

. O

It O
pretty O
much O
ruins O
the O
experiene O
for O
me O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
hoping O
they O
will O
fix O
this O
is O
a O
later O
patch O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
anyone O
with O
a O
2011 O
iMac O
or O
potentially O
any O
apple O
product O
. O

So O
... O
good O
keyboard O
, O
good O
touchpad O
, O
good O
display O
, O
good O
battery O
life O
. O

The O
chiclet O
keyboard O
is O
easy O
to O
type O
. O

Some O
call O
it O
grainy O
, O
I O
would O
say O
its O
like O
there O
is O
an O
extra O
layer O
of O
not O
quite O
transparent O
glass O
on O
top O
of O
the O
display O
. O

The O
one O
I O
purchased O
did O
n't O
fit O
into O
the O
camera O
even O
though O
it O
said O
the O
model O
was O
a O
U-8 O
. O

Small O
size O
so O
quite O
portable O
. O

I O
'll O
post O
the O
problems O
and O
their O
solutions O
that O
I O
discovered O
in O
case O
anyone O
else O
runs O
into O
similar O
problems O
. O

It O
fit O
as O
expected O
and O
he O
has O
not O
complained O
about O
the O
capacity O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
a O
little O
more O
padding O
, O
but O
I O
am O
always O
a O
little O
more O
on O
the O
safe O
side O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
add O
any O
additional O
speakers O
as O
the O
sound O
is O
just O
perfect O
as O
is O
. O

( O
dated O
July O
2011 O
) O

That O
could O
be O
why O
other O
people O
have O
complained O
of O
broken O
zippers O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
of O
all O
was O
that O
this O
enclosure O
did O
NOT O
require O
the O
use O
of O
two O
USB O
ports O
- O
what O
an O
inconvenience O
that O
would O
be O
! O

OUT O
PORT O
ALSO O
. O

I O
'm O
thoroughly O
impressed O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
pleased O
with O
any O
tech O
device O
. O

but O
I O
propped O
it O
open O
in O
an O
open O
air O
space O
for O
12 O
hours O
or O
so O
and O
the O
smell O
dissipated O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
supremely O
comfortable O
. O

The O
USB O
cord O
is O
a O
tad O
short O
( O
about O
3').(2 O
) O

and O
I O
was O
told O
it O
would O
take O
a O
lengthy O
stay O
at O
the O
repair O
shop O
to O
fix O
( O
eventually O
rebuilt O
) O
it O
. O

So O
I O
upgraded O
the O
memory O
on O
my O
new O
MBP O
to O
8 O
GB O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
into O
the O
marketing O
hype O
. O

And O
, O
they O
are O
small O
enough O
I O
can O
store O
them O
in O
my O
locker O
at O
work O
without O
having O
to O
haul O
them O
with O
me O
back O
and O
forth O
. O

Fit O
and O
FinishOverall O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
mic O
that O
is O
n't O
USB O
anymore O
, O
but O
this O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

If O
possible O
I O
will O
never O
purchase O
another O
Toshiba O
product O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
installed O
this O
device O
I O
get O
about O
15 O
signals O
with O
3 O
. O
5 O
to O
4 O
. O
5 O
bars O
. O

That O
's O
not O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
cord O
. O

One O
my O
secretary O
is O
using O
for O
travel O
and O
backup O
of O
office O
supplies O
. O

The O
laptop O
performs O
much O
better O
since O
installing O
twice O
the O
memory O
, O
a O
change O
the O
modestly O
priced O
Komputerbay O
cards O
made O
an O
obvious O
choice O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
I O
waited O
this O
long O
to O
try O
one O
. O

The O
sleek O
/ O
slim O
n O
sexy O
design O
( O
everyone O
knows O
how O
sleek O
MacBooks O
are O
.. O
so O
nothing O
new O
) O
Super O
fast O
booting O
. O

Obviously O
these O
little O
speakers O
wo O
n't O
be O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
full O
- O
size O
or O
professional O
speakers O
, O
but O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
similar O
portable O
speakers O
, O
the O
XBOOM O
provide O
more O
and O
better O
sound O
quality O
in O
a O
beautiful O
, O
small O
package O
. O

Frustrating O
when O
typing O
passwords O
especially O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
have O
used O
them O
to O
clean O
eyeglasses O
, O
sunglasses O
, O
an O
HDTV O
, O
several O
laptops O
and O
computer O
monitors O
, O
iPhones O
, O
iPads O
, O
watch O

, O
and O
various O
small O
electronic O

. O

Has O
better O
charge O
rate O
longer O
lasting O
. O

Wifi O
turns O
on O
instantly O
when O
I O
wake O
the O
device O
. O

A O
new O
item O
. O

Nice O
shape O
with O
battery O
bulge O
in O
back O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
hold O
and O

opted O
for O

and O
it O

kept O

this O

0 O
case O
and O
i O
keep O
there O
all O
my O

I O
bought O
this O
when O
it O
first O
came O
out O
at O
$ O
999 O
. O

but O
it O
was O
n't O
anything O
like O
I O
expected O
. O

but O
I O
think O
I O
fixed O
the O
problem O
... O

Macs O
are O
well O
known O
for O
ease O
of O
use O
and O
capabilities O
, O
but O
they O
have O
managed O
all O
that O
for O
years O
, O
with O
processors O
that O
are O
not O
always O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

you O
know O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
. O

Even O
the O
best O
laptop O
can O
experience O
overheating O
. O

Bought O
this O
converter O
to O
make O
this O
HDMI O
capable O
. O

Product O
is O
% O
100 O
working O
for O
now O
although O
I O
am O
being O
very O
careful O
with O
it O
. O

Could O
n't O
ask O
for O
anything O
more O
for O
the O
price O
! O

The O
hardest O
part O
is O
getting O
the O
old O
bezel O
off O
, O
which O
involves O
undoing O
six O
screws O
and O
fighting O
some O
residual O
stickystuff O
along O
the O
screen O
's O
lower O
edge O
. O

Supports O
two O
finger O
back O
/ O
forward O
swipes O
in O
Safari O
. O

and O
I O
had O
forgot O
about O
it O
, O
so O
I O
was O
very O
grateful O
for O
that O
. O

I O
still O
like O
it O
tho O

I O
purchased O
this O
model O
for O
my O
wife O
to O
replace O
her O
aging O
laptop O
; O
perfect O
use O
- O
case O
as O
she O
is O
in O
school O
, O
occasionally O
brings O
it O
to O
work O
, O
and O
uses O
it O
all O
around O
the O
house O
. O

They O
're O
comfortable O
, O
enough O
so O
that O
I O
definitely O
prefer O
them O
to O
ear O
buds O
. O

You O
can O
hardly O
tell O
it O
is O
there O
. O

Small O
and O
so O
far O
, O
works O
well O
. O

The O
ultra O
slim O
& O
still O
the O
world O
slimmest O
laptop O
running O
windows O
looks O
just O
great O
& O
different O
, O
i O
had O
a O
Studio O
XPS O
M1330 O
that O
looked O
really O
nice O
& O
compact O
& O
was O
for O
around O
the O
same O
price O
2 O
years O
ago O
( O
around O
$ O
1000 O
) O
but O
does O
n't O
come O
even O
near O
to O
how O
nice O
the O
Adamo O
XPS O
looks O
. O

Just O
looking O
at O
my O
old O
HDMI O
1080 O
monitor O
gave O
me O
headaches O
. O

DVD O
Drive O
- O
Other O
laptops O
tend O
to O
have O
DVD O
drive O
as O
an O
attachment O
but O

So O
far O
I O
have O
not O
used O
it O
and O
not O
had O
problems O
. O

Also O
, O
they O
" O
animate O
" O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
as O
the O
Apple O
battery O
-- O
lighting O
up O
away O
from O
the O
button O
and O
animating O
towards O
it O
rather O
than O
lighting O
up O
by O
the O
button O
first O
and O
animating O
away O
as O
the O
actual O
Apple O
battery O
does O
. O

For O
the O
Chromebook O
, O
you O
buy O
the O
apps O
from O
the O
Google O
Chrome O
site O
and O
not O
Google O
Play O
so O
for O
example O
, O
i O
wanted O
the O
Infinity O
X1 O
remote O
app O
for O
the O
Chromebook O

For O
the O
price O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
. O

It O
works O
far O
better O
on O
taller O
camera O
tripods O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
hard O
drive O
as O
a O
gift O
to O
someone O
who O
had O
to O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
videos O
and O
pictures O
after O
a O
vacation O
. O

Walking O
around O
( O
with O
the O
additions O
) O
, O
I O
feel O
very O
secure O
that O
pieces O
wo O
n't O
come O
crashing O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

We O
switched O
from O
IE O
to O
Google O
chrome O
as O
the O
browser O
and O
that O
helped O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
used O
it O
with O
the O
USB O
wireless O
stick O
and O
also O
connected O
it O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
devices O
( O
mp3 O
players O
, O
Roku O
, O
LCD O
monitor O
audio O
out O
, O
etc O
) O
using O
the O
line O
- O
in O
input O
. O

works O
good O
on O
my O
win O
8 O
laptop O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
is O
that O
you O
have O
to O
search O
Bluetooth O
from O
the O
start O
screen O
to O
find O
it O
also O
the O
plastic O
starts O
to O
come O
off O
but O
super O
glue O
fixed O
that O

I O
was O
hesitant O
to O
buy O
this O
backpack O
because O
I O
already O
had O
one O
for O
my O
notebook O

The O
class O
6 O
rating O
must O
not O
be O
for O
sustained O
use O
as O
my O
Sandisk O
Ultra O
class O
4 O
8 O
GB O
outperforms O
this O
card O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
negative O
comments O
seem O
nit O

Do O
n't O
leave O
home O
without O
it O
! O

You O
always O
have O
to O
realize O
there O
is O
something O
better O
out O
there O

People O
still O
complaints O
. O

I O
looked O
at O
keyboards O
at O
retails O
and O
on O
line O
for O
a O
while O
. O

That O
can O
mean O
burning O
out O
your O
CPU O
or O
GPU O
. O

I O
let O
it O
run O
till O
the O
battery O
level O
went O
to O
zero O
, O
about O
5 O
hrs O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
it O
would O
easily O
move O
out O
of O
place O
, O
but O
it O
has O
not O
so O
far O
. O

Although O
I O
usually O
choose O
a O
9- O
or O
12-cell O
for O
a O
longer O
battery O
life O
, O
in O
this O
case O
I O
chose O
the O
6-cell O
to O
keep O
the O
weight O
down O
. O

I O
am O
using O
a O
Verizon O
FiOS O
MI424WR O
router O
, O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
helps O
others O
. O

Battery O
life O
has O
been O
very O
impressive O
. O

I O
added O
back O
in O
one O
of O
the O
factory O
sticks O
I O
had O
removed O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
recognized O
it O
. O

Except O
for O
the O
memory O
card O
reader O
, O
all O
connections O
are O
on O
the O
sides O
. O

There O
are O
three O
slots O
inside O
one O
of O
the O
compartments O
for O
memory O
cards O
. O

Once O
the O
smell O
is O
gone O
, O
I O
will O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
also O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
good O
now O
that O
I O
started O
College O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
survive O
a O
big O
drop O
. O

Excellent O
sound O
, O
and O
I O
was O
so O
surprised O
at O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
sound O
, O
very O
high O
fidelity O
and O
no O
noise O
at O
all O
even O
cranked O
the O
volume O
up O
all O
the O
way O
. O

Macros O
and O
scripting O
are O
a O
nice O
feature O
as O
well O
, O
although O
most O
users O
will O
only O
ever O
use O
the O
former O
. O

The O
midrange O
meets O
or O
exceeds O
realistic O
expectations O
for O
this O
price O
range O
, O
particularly O
at O
lower O
volumes O
. O

set O
up O
with O
a O
sub O
and O
all O
aftermarket O
speakers O
and O
stereo O
. O

- O
I O
would O
lower O
my O
rating O
to O
two O
stars O
if O
it O
let O
me O
. O

You O
rotate O
them O
and O
pop O
them O
out O
whenever O
you O
need O
one O
. O

Finally O
got O
it O
to O
work O
using O
the O
driver O
from O
the O
supplied O
CD O
. O

After O
years O
and O
years O
of O
trying O
everything O
from O
North O
Face O
to O
Crumpler O
as O
my O
daily O
bag O
, O
I O
've O
found O
Timbuk2 O
to O
fit O
my O
needs O
the O
best O
. O

That O
may O
be O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O

When O
I O
connected O
the O
tablet O
to O
my O
55 O
" O
HD O
LED O
TV O
, O
I O
was O
not O
sure O
how O
well O
it O
would O
work O
, O
but O
once O
again O
, O
a O
perfect O
full O
screen O
image O
appeared O
. O

I O
really O
thought O
this O
was O
going O
to O
be O
less O
quality O
than O
what O
actually O
arrived O
, O
but O
this O
sleeve O
is O
absolutely O
perfect O
for O
the O
Retina O
MacBook O
Pro O
13&#34 O
; O
! O

As O
for O
the O
touchpad O
, O
I O
wish O
the O
clicking O
sound O
and O
feel O
was O
a O
bit O
quieter O
and O
" O
refined O
" O
, O
but O
I O
found O
that O
you O
can O
left O
- O
click O
just O
by O
tapping O
on O
the O
touchpad O
instead O
of O
pressing O
down O
. O

( O
Whaddya O
want O
, O
it O
's O
a O
new O
product O
) O

I O
purchased O
to O
of O
these O
at O
the O
same O
time O
- O
one O
for O
me O
, O
and O
one O
for O
my O
son O
. O

easily O
adjustable O
. O

The O
design O
flaws O
i O
mentioned O
above O
have O
been O
reviewed O
by O
Wacom O
forum O
reps O
on O
their O
Wacom O
Europe O
forums O
. O

great O
packaging O
and O
quality O
as O
well O
as O
great O
customer O
care O
/ O
support O
. O

This O
hub O
is O
obviously O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
USB O
1 O
hub O
. O

etc O
etc O
... O

It O
is O
very O
fast O
, O
has O
some O
nice O
encryption O
software O
with O
it O
, O
and O
is O
really O
small O
and O
skinny O
( O
good O
for O

The O
installation O
was O
on O
the O
slow O
side O
, O
taking O
4 O
- O
5 O
minutes O
, O
but O
soon O
enough O
I O
had O
the O
app O
running O
and O
I O
opened O
the O
bluetooth O
app O
from O
my O
icon O
tray O
. O

Liked O
the O
idea O
of O
organizing O
all O
the O
little O
electronic O
and O
personal O
things O
. O

I O
like O
the O
way O
you O
can O
zip O
in O
the O
lenses O
so O
they O
do O
n't O
fall O
out O
by O
mistake O
. O

Shipping O
was O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
but O
as O
well O
as O
it O
works O
for O
my O
family O
member O
, O
I O
should O
've O
bought O
one O
for O
myself O
. O

What O
they O
require O
is O
that O
the O
laptop O
be O
in O
a O
bag O
with O
nothing O
else O
stacked O
on O
top O
of O
it O
so O
that O
the O
x O
- O
ray O
can O
clearly O
see O
the O
laptop O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
features O
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

The O
product O
is O
like O
a O
pen O
drive O
, O
but O
comes O
with O
an O
extension O
cable O
and O
stand O

This O
device O
is O
great O
. O

What O
else O
is O
there O
to O
say O
. O

I O
got O
this O
product O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
doubt O
about O
its O
functionality O
, O
but O
after O
connecting O
it O
to O
an O
Android O
tablet O
and O
saw O
that O
it O
worked O
, O
I O
began O
using O
it O
. O

Works O
great O
! O

It O
charges O
via O
usb O
cable O
. O

It O
's O
a O
solid O
computer O
if O
you O
're O
not O
doing O
things O
like O
gaming O
or O
editing O
. O

: O
I O
still O
use O
this O
device O
EVERY O
day O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
tried O
experimenting O
with O
moving O
the O
machine O
, O
but O
it O
connects O
well O
where O
its O
sitting O
. O

Because O
these O
are O
super O
sticky O
you O
can O
just O
slap O
it O
on O
letting O
it O
overhang O
the O
lapel O
and O
not O
worry O
about O
it O
falling O
off O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
bluetooth O
adapter O
specifically O
to O
connect O
a O
laptop O
to O
the O
lego O
mindstorms O

re O
- O
set O
it O
several O
times.- O

Its O
easily O
cleanable O
& O
has O
plenty O
of O
straps O
to O
fasten O
it O
in O
your O
vehicle O
any O
which O
way O
you O
please O
! O

I O
hate O
to O
& O
# O
34;jinx&#34 O
; O
anything O
by O
commenting O
, O
but O
so O
far O
... O

I O
actually O
compared O
the O
LN52A650 O
to O
the O
Sony O
52 O
" O
XBR6 O
at O
the O
local O
BB O
and O
the O
pictures O
were O
essentially O
identical O
. O

However O
, O
the O
product O
has O
a O
great O
fit O
with O
a O
high O
grade O
of O
leather O
. O

store O
business O
cards O
, O
pens O
, O
tissues O
, O
cash O
, O
and O
other O
misc O
. O

So O
I O
purchased O
a O
lightweight O
, O
insulated O
lap O
pad O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
this O
little O
mouse O
. O

Works O
really O
good O
with O
the O
Creative O
wireless O
speakers O
and O
also O
with O
& O
# O

.... O
range O
is O
30 O
feet O
or O
less O
and O
signal O
blocks O
out O
if O
you O
walk O
between O
transmitter O
and O
speaker O
... O
otherwise O
really O
nice O
. O

Mac O
has O
definitely O
got O
PC O
beat O
in O
this O
area O
by O
a O
landslide O
. O

Unless O
you O
know O
where O
they O
are O
and O
what O
they O
do O
, O
you O
'll O
likely O
not O
be O
able O
to O
operate O
them O
. O

Also O
looked O
at O
the O
SB O
model O
and O
Sony O
has O
removed O
the O
option O
to O
upgrade O
the O
video O
card O
on O
it O
. O

The O
company O
was O
great O
to O
do O
business O
with O
, O
they O
contacted O
me O
when O
the O
product O
shipped O
and O
checked O
back O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
arrived O
. O

The O
computer O
starts O
from O
off O
in O
16 O
seconds O
, O
resumes O
from O
sleep O
in O
just O
a O
few O
seconds O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
camo O
; O
I O
was O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
backpack O
itself O
. O

I O
tried O
it O
again O
a O
few O
days O
later O
and O

OneTouch O

I O
've O
always O
liked O
Samsung O
TV O
's O
for O
their O
screens O
and O
the O
screen O
on O
this O
laptop O
does O
n't O
disappoint O
. O

I O
have O
about O
6 O
weeks O
time O
on O
it O
, O
and O
there O
are O
no O
flaws O
. O

It O
has O
2 O
usb O
ports O
one O
of O
which O
is O
high O
powered O
for O
even O
bigger O
devices O

But O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
to O
find O
the O
medium O
sized O
one O
and O
I O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
that O
Canon O
itself O
is O
selling O
this O
model O

snugly O

still O
allowed O
enough O
stretch O
for O
me O
to O
tuck O
the O
charger O
and O
a O
mouse O
( O
again O
, O
no O

inside O
. O

The O
one O
I O
received O
did O
not O
function O
properly O
. O

I O
know O
I O
had O
seen O
a O
couple O
of O
reviews O
that O
said O
the O
converter O
had O
stopped O
working O
. O

I O
placed O
a O
plastic O
water O
bottle O
on O
it O
to O
keep O
it O
dry O
and O
have O
it O
on O
a O

. O

The O
fan O
started O
clicking O
a O
while O
ago O
as O
if O
it O
had O
a O
broken O

. O

As O
for O
the O

you O
have O
another O

is O

First O
and O

, O
this O
is O

, O
install O
one O

into O
your O

a O

but O
when O
you O
type O
the O
edges O
near O
the O
bottom O
feels O
like O
it O
is O
cutting O
your O
wrists O
a O
little O
. O

We O
mount O
it O
with O
one O
of O
the O
included O

so O
that O
it O
is O
between O

, O
Dell O

customer O

has O
soured O
me O
on O
the O
company O
totally O
. O

so O
I O
wanted O
to O
comment O
on O
my O
experience O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
them O
. O

As O
for O
the O
laptop O
, O
it O
now O
runs O
very O
well O
. O

This O
unit O
comes O
with O
a O
replacement O
black O
faceplate O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
fit O
my O
drive O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
replace O
the O
fans O
just O
before O
the O
laptop O
ate O
it O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
my O
current O
and O
previous O
android O
device O
with O
much O
success O
. O

I O
tried O
this O
backpack O
and O
it O
is O
great O
. O

Great O

the O
quality O
of O

and O
like O
all O
my O
other O
devices O
if O
I O
need O
anything O
else O
I O
will O
run O
through O
my O
phone O
. O

I O
wanted O
the O
computer O
to O
use O
despite O
unplugging O
the O
built O
in O
card O
. O

Had O
to O
search O
for O
the O
correct O
drivers O
, O
even O
then O
I O
sometimes O
have O
file O
transfer O
issues O
from O
my O
phone O
to O
PC O
. O

No O
problem O
, O
IF O
you O
have O
two O

available O
on O

I O
particularly O
like O
the O
slick O
keyboard O
, O
the O
slicker O
screen O
, O
the O
super O
fast O
processor O
( O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
need O
anything O
that O
fast O
in O
a O
portable O
device O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
to O
have O
) O
and O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
( O
must O
be O
the O
SSD O
) O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
13 O
" O
laptop O
, O
or O
something O
smaller O
, O
this O
product O
will O
do O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
use O
this O
as O
a O
backpack O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
my O
comments O
are O
positive O

all O
the O
way O
up O
is O
automatic O

After O
several O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
she O
has O
found O
it O
to O
be O
a O
solid O
, O
reliable O
source O
of O
power O
when O
she O
's O
using O
her O
computer O
in O
our O
vehicles O
. O

It O
only O
works O
on O
Windows O
, O
as O
well O
, O
and O
since O
I O
'm O
on O
a O
Mac O

I O
did O
not O
return O
it O
, O
I O
may O
be O
able O
to O
find O
some O
use O
for O
it O
in O
the O
future O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
USB O
charging O
port O
, O
although O
I O
've O
yet O
to O
test O
that O
. O

I O
'm O
concerned O
long O
term O
use O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
handle O
failing O
and O
my O
laptop O
on O

broken O

My O

still O
going O

everything O

so O
I O
will O

The O

every O

you O

travel O

, O
the O

a O
little O
bit O
junky O
, O
but O
I O
was O
only O
interested O
in O
the O
case O
) O

Works O
well O
for O
that O
purpose O
! O

A O
simple O
warning O
on O
the O
cd O
itself O
or O
a O
sticker O
on O
the O

warning O
against O
this O
would O
suffice O
. O

Since O
i O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
it O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
whatsoever O
. O

This O
case O
arrived O
quickly O
and O
fits O
great O
! O

This O
Lapdesk O
can O
be O
used O
with O
the O
angle O
facing O
either O
direction O
, O
depending O
on O
what O
you O
are O
doing O

Both O
the O
camera O
and O
microphone O
work O
out O
of O
the O
box O
on O

Linux O
with O
little O
additional O
configuration O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
backpack O
, O
which O
is O
an O
interesting O
visual O
departure O
from O
the O
usual O
nylon O
canvas O
style O
of O

. O

Looks O
nice O
! O

it O
has O
worked O
out O
well O

I O
installed O
this O
properly O
and O
the O
air O
bubbles O
where O
supposed O
to O
go O
away O
after O
a O
week O
that O
never O
happen O
, O
so O
I O
called O
them O
and O
they O
sent O
me O
out O
a O
brand O
new O
one O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O

I O
paid O
$ O
8 O

for O
this O
and O
it O
works O
, O
works O
well O
. O

Nice O
and O

, O
if O
you O
've O
got O
your O
tablet O
plugged O
into O
the O

and O
are O

, O
the O

will O
be O
charged O

then O
the O

This O
is O
a O
shame O
because O
I O
use O
my O

quite O
a O
bit O
and O
have O
to O
have O
them O
turned O
up O
all O
the O
way O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
that O
's O
often O
not O
loud O
enough O

shoot O
camera O
. O

A+ O
piece O
of O
work O
. O

This O
is O
the O
slowest O
SD O
card O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
, O
and O
by O
a O
fair O
margin O
too O
. O

but O
now O
it O
's O
beyond O
doubt O
. O

Just O
because O
a O
webcam O
is O
advertised O
as O
HD O
, O
does O
n't O
make O
it O
so O
. O

I O
ordered O
this O
item O
because O
my O
laptop O
crashed O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
way O
to O
extract O
some O
information O
off O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
've O
dropped O
my O
nb O
from O
my O
truck O
and O
the O
case O
saved O
it O
's O
life O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
from O
a O
shopping O
channel O
for O
about O
$ O
949 O
. O
00 O
. O

I O
may O
have O
to O
investigate O
this O
further O
. O

But O
, O
one O
thing O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
laptops O
lack O
in O
this O
price O
range O
, O
but O
this O
one O
has O
, O
is O
a O
dedicated O
graphics O
card O
. O

The O
price O
was O
very O
compatible O
as O
well O
! O

If O
you O
need O
a O
solution O
to O
get O
Bluetooth O
audio O
to O
a O
car O
receiver O
or O
other O
device O
for O
an O
reasonable O
price O
this O
will O
work O
for O
you O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
great O
. O

There O
is O
one O
more O
small O
zippered O
space O
on O
the O
outside O
space O
. O

It O
took O
less O
than O
15 O
more O
seconds O
to O
get O
to O
the O
desktop O
. O

a O
mouse O
that O
provides O
some O
personality O
with O
functionality O
. O
is O
fun O
to O
use O
and O
does O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
international O
trip O
, O
I O
took O
a O
large O
backpack O
as O
my O
carry O
one O
and O
it O
worked O
pretty O
well O
except O
it O
was O
very O
large O
. O

I O
find O
this O
product O
extremely O
useful O
when O
the O
camera O
is O
on O
a O
tripod O
. O

My O
only O
problem O
with O
the O
system O
is O
that O
it O
looks O
so O
good O
that O
I O
tend O
to O
just O
sit O
and O
watch O
TV O
because O
it O
looks O
so O
good O
. O

The O
first O
, O
truly O
annoying O
thing O
is O
that O
when O
this O
device O
is O
not O
working O
( O
ergo O
, O
no O
internet O
) O
you O
get O
a O
URL O
address O
where O
you O
can O
go O
for O
support O
... O

When O
I O
first O
opened O
up O
the O
box O
and O
plugged O
it O
in O
, O
I O
wondered O
if O
it O
would O
recognize O
my O
ATT O
4 O
G O
wireless O
modem O
. O

I O
have O
to O
write O
an O
update O
. O

I O
use O
Dolphin O
HD O
as O
my O
browser O
, O
and O
the O
stock O
keyboard O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
battery O
door O
sticks O
, O
but O
mostly O
does O
well O
. O

Another O
benefit O
: O
It O
is O
slightly O
larger O
than O
the O
original O
battery O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
expect O
that O
. O

I O
've O
made O
the O
hard O
decision O
to O
return O
this O
item O
. O

This O
works O
very O
well O
. O

Only O
negative O
is O
that O
there O
were O
no O
install O
instructions O
. O

Upgraded O
the O
single O
4 O
g O
card O
in O
my O
Levono O
with O
two O
of O
these O
. O

Like O
most O
Bluetooth O
speakers O
, O
press O
and O
hold O
the O
power O
button O
to O
turn O
on O
. O

Excellent O
protection O
for O
Mac O
.Measures O
perfect O
and O
leaves O
the O
Macbook O
Air O
with O
its O
natural O
beauty O
. O

This O
Belkin O
splitter O
preserves O
stereo O
separation O
with O
no O
loss O
of O
volume O
at O
a O
dirt O
cheap O
price O
, O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
just O
buy O
it O
! O

You O
can O
change O
all O
the O
colors O
and O
have O
different O
options O
to O
have O
them O
get O
brighter O
and O
brighter O
until O
it O
turns O
off O
and O
restarts O
, O
have O
a O
wave O
motion O
where O
it O
gets O
bright O
from O
one O
end O
and O
moves O
toward O
the O
either O
, O
and O
dual O
color O
where O
it O
mixes O
two O
colors O
and O
constantly O
changes O
( O
my O
favorite O
) O
. O

I O
guess O
I O
'll O
stick O
to O
that O
old O
UHF O
antenna O
for O
the O
coniverter O
box O
and O
the O
extra O
- O
large O
but O
efficinet O
antenna O
that O
came O
with O
the O
digital O
TV O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
product O
about O
10 O
months O
ago O
for O
my O
dv9000 O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
noisier O
than O
my O
laptop O
's O
fans O
when O
they O
're O
running O
at O
full O
speed O
. O

I O
first O
saw O
this O
computer O
at O
Sam O
's O
Club O
( O
eventually O
where O
I O
bought O
it O
too O
) O
and O
was O
completely O
infatuated O
. O

Dell O
and O
other O
laptop O
manufacturer O
's O
have O
had O
to O
recall O
adapters O
that O
caused O
fires O
. O

You O
can O
not O
hook O
headphones O
and O
a O
microphone O
in O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
because O
there O
is O
just O
one O
port O
! O

This O
might O
be O
better O
protected O
when O
you O
're O
wearing O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
and O
gravity O
is O
pulling O
the O
fabric O
tight O
enough O
to O
close O
that O
hole O
, O
but O
your O
gear O
remains O
exposed O
to O
the O
elements O
. O

Let O
me O
first O
start O
by O
saying O
how O
well O
Amazon O
customer O
service O
is O
. O

It O
has O
a O
more O
had O
drive O
space O
than O
others O
- O
that O
ITB O
is O
so O
good O
for O
movies O
and O
home O
videos O
. O

Beautiful O
shimmery O
champagne O
/ O
graphite O
color O
, O
not O
the O
boring O
stainless O
steel O
) O
7 O
. O

They O
're O
my O
go O
to O
ram O
company O
these O
days O
. O

, O
sometimes O
that O
presenter O
has O
been O
me O
. O

The O
processing O
power O
is O
adequate O
, O
the O
graphics O
is O
good O
enough O
to O
handle O
Portal O
, O
HL2 O
, O
and O
TF2 O
without O
much O
problem O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
is O
n't O
uncomfortable O
. O

then O
it O
took O
a O
bit O
of O
trial O
and O
error O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
best O
way O
to O
set O
the O
other O
keys O
. O

1 O
) O
I O
got O
my O
package O
perfectly O
! O

first O
, O
i O
am O
not O
pro O
spending O
a O
lot O
of O
$ O
$ O
on O
laptops O
w/ O
technology O
changing O
so O
quickly O
. O

Installation O
was O
straight O
forward O
with O
a O
heat O
gun O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
patience O
as O
my O
old O
screen O
was O
shattered O
. O

I O
'm O
currently O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O
60 O
" O
3D O
LED O
TV O
and O
these O
issues O
with O
Sony O
quality O

It O
installed O
a O
few O
apps O
quickly O
and O
all O
worked O
well O
. O

Interesting O
combination O
. O

My O
first O
power O
bank O
stopped O
working O
after O
3 O
months O
of O
daily O
use O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
item O
for O
a O
client O
works O
well O
. O

Two O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
slots O
, O
an O
HDMI O
out O
& O
Bluetooth O
connectivity O
. O

Hi O
guys O
! O

No O
, O
I O
would O
get O
several O
on O
ebay O
for O
less O
than O
.99 O
each O
and O
wait O
for O
shipping O
from O
Thailand O
, O
china O
, O
or O
elsewhere O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
SanDisk O
gives O
you O
a O
five O
year O
( O
limited O
) O
warranty O
; O
that O
's O
a O
plus O
. O

Than O
they O
also O
froze O
. O

The O
trays O
slide O
all O
the O
way O
out O
and O
are O
hard O
to O
get O
back O
in O
and O
it O
's O
pretty O
expensive O
for O
an O
item O
that O
lacks O
any O
real O
finesse O
( O
Thick O
, O
ugly O
and O
heavy O
plastic).On O
the O
bright O
side O

A O
really O
nice O
case O
for O
the O
money O
and O
has O
room O
for O
extra O
stuff O
in O
the O
zip O
on O
the O
side O
. O

( O
15 O
inch O
will O
not O
fit O
properly O
) O
and O
as O
a O
camera O
bag O
. O

It O
will O
walk O
away O
because O
of O
the O
punch O
but O
only O
on O
a O
hard O
surface O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
a O
14 O
" O
laptop O
, O
maybe O
or O
one O
that O
is O
n't O
widescreen O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
little O
while O
to O
get O
used O
to O
Windows O
8 O
, O
but O
it O
's O
actually O
pretty O
great O
. O

Not O
so O
lucky O
with O
my O
HP O
desktop O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
happy O
this O
laptop O
goes O
with O
the O
flow O
... O
:) O

So O
I O
opened O
it O
up O
and O
removed O
the O
wireless O
B O
network O
board O
, O
and O
use O
this O
instead O
. O

I O
mainly O
bought O
this O
for O
the O
music O
, O
and O
for O
that O
it O
's O
working O
really O
well O
. O

The O
V7 O
16 O
" O
bag O
really O
seems O
like O
a O
good O
deal O
to O
me O
. O

It O
's O
a O
terrible O
design O
. O

Given O
that O
, O
it O
sounds O
amazing O
. O

Great O
price O
too O
. O

After O
purchasing O
3 O
Panasonic O
Plasma O
TVs O
( O
including O
the O
65-inch O
TH-65PX600U O
monster O
) O
and O
one O
Samsung O
50-inch O
plasma O
, O
I O
saw O
my O
parent O
's O
Samsung O
LCD O
and O
was O
blown O
away O
. O

She O
stayed O
on O
that O
laptop O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
bluetooth O
wireless O
keyboard O
, O
quickly O
, O
connects O
to O
the O
the O
i O
- O
pad O
. O

Hopefully O
it O
stays O
that O
way O
! O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
subwoofer O
is O
so O
powerful O
, O
that O
when O
she O
is O
listening O
to O
it O
loud O
, O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
bass O
throughout O
the O
house O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
dock O
is O
a O
must O
have O
if O
you O
have O
the O
TF700 O
T O
Infinity O
. O

I O
took O
my O
time O
and O
slowly O
pulled O
along O
the O
lines O
. O

Keyboard- O
keyboard O
feels O
good O
. O

, O
I O
'm O
sure O
over O
time O
it O
will O
loosen O
up O
to O
the O
point O
where O
insertion O
and O
removal O
are O
a O
breeze O
. O

Last O
Long O
. O

I O
must O
say O
the O
battery O
seems O
quite O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
Garmin O
original O
and O
replacement O
. O

Real O
World O
Scenario O

: O
the O
power O
connector O
from O
your O
charger O
to O
your O
laptop O
sticks O
straight O
out O
from O
the O
back O
or O
side O
of O
your O
machine O
. O

At O
least O
not O
the O
standard O
looking O
camera O
bag O
that O
most O
tourists O
walk O
around O
with O
. O

; O
expect O
some O
extra O

. O

I O
had O
been O
using O
an O
earlier O
$ O
25 O
version O
of O
Targus O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
upgrade O
into O
this O
one O
expecting O
that O
since O
it O
was O
double O
the O
price O
it O
would O
surely O
be O
an O
improved O
technology O
. O

was O
I O
surprised O
at O
how O
well O
it O
works O
. O

so O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
else O
. O

I O
leave O
it O
outside O
for O
2 O
days O
and O
odor O
has O
diminished O
some O
, O
but O
is O
still O
too O
smelly O
to O
put O
in O
my O
bag O
. O

However O
, O
I O
fly O
often O
and O
became O
curious O
about O
how O
NC O
phones O
would O
fit O
my O
needs O
. O

It O
has O
a O
24 O
GB O
flash O
boot O
drive O
and O
a O
500 O
GB O

and O
it O
's O
really O
come O
through O
for O
me O
. O

This O
enables O
your O
device O
to O
be O
a O
GPS O
system O
for O
your O
car O
, O
with O
turn O
by O
turn O
directions O
available O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
Google O
Navigator O
that O
ships O
for O
free O
with O
the O
device O
. O

Oh O
, O
shop O
around O
for O
price O
. O

Good O
sound O
for O
close O
in O
listening O
or O
boosting O
the O
sound O
on O
my O
mac O
when O
I O
'm O
watching O
movies O
. O

I O
think O
everything O
is O
adequately O
padded O
. O

This O
VGA O
Cable O
works O
as O
well O
as O
the O
more O
expensive O
one O
I O
have O
, O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
, O
I O
used O
this O
cable O
to O
connect O
my O
computer O
to O
my O
Vizio O
TV O
, O
would O
recommend O
this O
cable O
to O
all O
who O
need O
a O
cable O
for O
their O
monitors O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
because O
my O
old O
Portege O
tablet O
decided O
it O
was O
time O
to O
pass O
on O
it O
's O
knowledge O
via O
a O
external O
hard O
drive O
and O
then O
go O
the O
way O
of O
the O
tox O
drop O
recycler O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
noise O
canceling O
is O
good O
, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
sound O
it O
produces O
is O
very O
good O
as O
well O
. O

Loved O
that O
it O
still O
had O
the O
DVD O
drive O
even O
at O
3 O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
on O
my O
iPad O
mini O
. O

So O
i O
would O
say O
, O
if O
you O
RMA O
yours O
, O
have O
a O
quiet O
fan O
setup O
so O
it O
does O
nt O
overheat O
and O
minimizes O
the O
usage O
of O
the O
loud O
built O
in O
fan O
, O
this O
product O
is O
exceptionally O
good O
. O
if O
it O
were O
nt O
for O
the O
fan O
, O
I O
would O
give O
it O
a O
5 O
out O
5 O
. O

All O
ports O
are O
accessible O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
two O
things O
that O
you O
should O
concern O
about O
the O
bluetooth O
before O
you O
buy O
this O
. O

I O
can O
contrast O
it O
to O
another O
budget O
laptop O
( O
Toshiba O
) O
that O
a O
family O
member O
uses O
. O

This O
one O
has O
been O
going O
for O
two O
months O
. O

Do O
n't O
have O
any O
benchmark O
tests O
, O
but O
it O
's O
great O
. O

Nice O
quality O
bag O
. O

Twice O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
original O
Mac O
memory O
and O
super O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

It O
is O
particularly O
noticeable O
at O
the O
login O
screen O
--- O
which O
should O
be O
a O
solid O
blue O
, O
but O
you O
can O
see O
outlines O
of O
the O
previous O
images O
before O
you O
locked O
the O
computer O
... O
but O
this O
is O
just O
speculation O
, O
I O
did O
not O
open O
either O
up O
to O
determine O
if O
they O
actually O
changed O
panels O
mid O
production O
. O

When O
I O
plug O
it O
in O
, O
I O
get O
" O
The O
AC O
power O
adapter O
type O
can O
not O
be O
determined O
. O

In O
Windows O
8 O
use O
the O
Search O
box O
and O
type O
in O
' O
recovery O
drive O
' O
. O

The O
screen O
on O
my O
PC O
gets O
somewhat O
cruddy O
because O
I O
have O
my O
morning O
coffee O
and O
most O
of O
my O
meals O
in O
front O
of O
the O
PC O
. O

As O
others O
have O
said O
, O
it O
is O
huge O
. O

Fits O
nice O
, O
works O
great O
. O

I O
used O
the O
CoolMaster O
Hyper O
212 O
Evo O
and O
it O
fit O
fine O

The O
senor O
on O
the O
keyboard O
automatically O

; O
while O
it O
should O
run O
, O
I O
need O
to O
have O
this O
game O
at O
max O
settings O
and O
this O
laptop O
simply O
would O
n't O
handle O
it O
, O
graphics O
wise O
( O
plus O
, O
playing O
this O
on O
anything O
less O
than O

would O
seem O
like O
a O
huge O

) O
. O

Two O
months O
later O
, O
she O
closed O
the O
coverand O
a O
small O
object O
got O
caught O
in O
between O
the O
glass O
and O
the O
keyboard O
. O

So O
I O
tend O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
retyping O
. O

but O
I O
'm O
glad O
I O
paid O
the O
extra O
money O
for O
this O
set O
. O

I O
use O
this O
when O
travelling O
to O
hook O
up O
my O
phone O
with O
Google O
Music O
. O

This O
little O
netbook O
is O
everything O
I O
need O
. O

I O
'm O
used O
to O
having O
my O
thumb O
comfortably O
resting O
near O
my O
space O
bar O
for O
jumping O
, O
but O
with O
the O
G13 O
my O
thumb O
is O
in O
the O
un O
- O
used O
empty O
space O
between O
the O
joystick O
and O
a O
couple O
G O
buttons O
- O
none O
of O
which O
are O
inherently O
apparent O
to O
be O
" O
space".3 O
) O

it O
connects O
so O
quickly O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
you O
'd O
ever O
use O
the O
cable O
. O

If O
you O
intend O
to O
use O
this O
splitter O
for O
actual O
PWM O
use O
, O
you O
'll O
need O
to O
clip O
one O
yellow O
wire O
at O
one O
of O
the O
male O
plugs O
- O
this O
wire O
carries O
fan O
speed O
data O
to O
the O
motherboard O
and O
it O
'll O
get O
confused O
with O
data O
from O
two O
fans O
on O
the O
same O
pin O
. O

mouse O
tracking O
problems O
. O

Luckily O
I O
'm O
not O
taking O
the O
drive O
in O
and O
out O
, O
so O
I O
can O
leave O
it O
in O
and O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

Did O
not O
work O
on O
another O
monitor O
of O
a O
different O
brand O
but O
upon O
research O
it O
was O
the O
monitor O
so O
if O
ur O
gon O
na O
use O
a O
monitor O
be O
sure O
it O
supports O
the O
encryption O
type O
as O
some O
have O
restrictions O
on O
what O
types O
of O
encrypted O
data O
can O
be O
received O
and O
translated O
. O

Really O
not O
much O
more O
to O
say O
; O
it O
's O
a O
power O
adapter O

You O
can O
feel O
it O
's O
quality O
when O
you O
're O
using O
it O
. O

I O
did O
expect O
this O
to O
workI O
hoped O
it O
might O
be O
nice O
and O
have O
a O
few O
things O
going O
for O
it O
besides O
just O
workingI O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
new O
computers O
should O
be O
jammed O
full O
of O
software O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
. O

So O
there O
is O
no O
consistency O
here O
, O
even O
with O
moving O
the O
computer O
around O
to O
find O
the O
optimal O
position O
of O
connectivity O
. O

This O
backpack O
has O
been O
on O
many O
airplane O
trips O
and O
hikes O
/ O
shoots O
and O
still O
in O
great O
shape O
. O

This O
basically O
means O
that O
this O
RAM O
ends O
up O
being O
faster O
than O
the O
stock O
RAM O
at O
the O
same O
frequency O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
plain O
13 O
. O

Some O
are O
pure O
junk O
, O
designed O
to O
stop O
functioning O
in O
a O
short O
period O
if O
they O
work O
as O
advertised O
at O
all O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
this O
for O
someone O
who O
wants O
to O
keep O
their O
laptop O
locked O
to O
a O
desk O
but O
also O
use O
it O
while O
locked O
. O

Reliably O
holds O
2 O
classes O
worth O
of O
materials O
. O

4 O
GB O
SODIMMs O
bought O
at O
Amazon O
. O

Nice O
case O
, O
but O
a O
very O
snug O
fit O
with O
my O
Asus O
17 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

This O
review O
will O
be O
based O
about O
the O
" O
use O
" O
of O
the O
netbook O
. O

And O
it O
's O
Bose O
, O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
find O
a O
better O
build O
quality O
. O

It O
has O
a O
good O
snug O
fit O
at O
the O
computer O
connection O
. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
compartments O
to O
hold O
your O
items O
, O
business O
cards O
, O
pens O
, O
memory O
sticks O
, O
airline O
tickets O
, O
mice O
, O
etc O
. O

This O
webcam O
was O
purchased O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
laptop O
to O
be O
used O
for O
video O
conferencing O
. O

We O
'll O
see O
how O
the O
Win O
XP O
netbook O
performs O
. O

It O
feels O
cheaper O
connecting O
to O
the O
tablet O
as O
well O
- O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
make O
accidental O
keystrokes O
. O

I O
'll O
update O
this O
review O
if O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
so O
far O
I O
'm O
happy O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
price O
was O
right O
. O

Great O
pricing O
for O
gold O
tipped O
cable O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'm O
being O
harsh O
because O
I O
'm O
comparing O
it O
to O
the O
fantastic O
Gateway O
. O

Due O
to O
Chase O
security O
settings O
and O
the O

LaptopCPU O

is O
not O
as O

as O
the O
Dell O

since O
my O
original O
12 O
year O
old O
bag O
finally O
started O
to O
show O
its O
age O
, O
this O
will O
be O
an O
adequate O
replacement O
until O
I O
see O
something O
better O
. O

Left O
and O
right O
mouse O

If O
you O
have O
this O
type O
of O
shipping O
make O
sure O
you O
turn O
the O
TV O
and O
test O
prior O
to O
the O
shipper O
departing O
in O
case O
the O
TV O
has O
a O
defect O
. O

perfect O
for O
my O
IPAD O
MINI O
.. O

Sure O
, O
it O
's O
not O
quite O
as O
nicely O
designed O
or O
as O
solidly O
built O
, O
but O
for O
graphics O
and O
photo O
editing O

Caution O
, O
this O
notebook O
is O
the O
only O
one O
on O
my O
list O
that O
i O
'd O
stricktly O
only O
recommened O
to O
those O
looking O
to O
use O
it O
as O
a O
netbook.+/- O
$ O
454 O

It O
bumped O
ASUS O
card O
from O
hogging O
my O
Sound O
options O
and O
rendering O
them O
unstable O
. O

Fix O
this O
by O
going O
in O
Device O
Manager O
- O
> O
Universal O
Serial O
Bus O
controllers O
, O
going O
to O
each O
USB O
Hub O
item O
and O
unticking O

I O
have O
had O
this O
case O
for O
six O
months O
and O
love O
it O
- O
very O
protective O
and O
sturdy O
. O

Great O
idea O
. O

The O
larger O
Air O
has O
more O
room O
for O
a O
battery O
and O
thus O
has O
a O
longer O
battery O
life O
. O

Not O
much O
to O
say O
, O
it O
works O
exactly O
as O
it O
should O
. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
I O
've O
had O
to O
worry O
about O
draining O
the O
battery O
yet O
. O

It O
does O
not O
have O
handles O
like O
my O
first O
one O
but O
is O
nice O
looking O
and O
fills O
my O
expectations O
. O

There O
's O
nothing O
special O
about O
the O
tripod O
holder O
, O
but O
it O
is O
nice O
that O
you O
can O
conceal O
it O
when O
not O
in O
use O
. O

The O
case O
is O
a O
little O
awkward O
. O

My O
only O
minor O
gripe O
has O
been O
expressed O
by O
others O
, O
the O
side O
mesh O
pocket O
is O
pretty O
useless O
for O
carrying O
a O
water O
bottle O
. O

I O
wanted O
one O
with O
a O
small O
height O
dimension O
so O
it O
could O
fit O
in O
the O
case O

I O
was O
way O
off O
base O
with O
my O
expectations O
of O
low O
quality O
as O
this O
sounds O
better O
than O
most O
of O
the O
more O
expensive O
radios O
in O
my O
house O
! O

fits O
tightly O
unlike O
another O
another O
battery O
I O
previously O
bought O
. O

The O
new O
multi O
- O
touch O
trackpad O
is O
a O
vast O
improvement O
over O
trackpads O
of O
the O
past O
, O
though O
it O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
using O
the O
pad O
as O
both O
mouse O
navigator O
and O
mouse O
button O
. O

It O
does O
the O
job O
though O
. O

so O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
's O
going O
on O
with O
him O
. O

So O
if O
you O
live O
in O
a O
dusty O
area O
, O
or O
have O
electronics O
with O
screens O
that O
you O
use O
infrequently O
, O
this'll O
probably O
come O
in O
handy O
. O

That O
worked O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

The O
Zoo O
- O
Tunes O
Portable O
Mini O
Character O
Speaker O
that O
I O
received O
is O
a O
cute O
orange O
tiger O
. O

Charging O
time O
is O
6 O
- O
7hr O
when O
using O
a O
regular O
( O
500 O
mAmp O
) O
USB O
port O
on O
my O
computer O
. O

So O
they O
neglected O
to O
enable O
this O
feature O
. O

They O
lose O
one O
star O
because O
there O
is O
only O
one O
mesh O
cover O
in O
the O
box O
. O

6 O
amps O
max O
) O
. O

Seriously O
Samsung O
get O
a O
matrix O
of O
your O
different O
models O
with O
some O
decent O
specs O
! O

But O
all O
I O
care O
about O
really O
hardware O
- O
wise O
is O
how O
rough O
or O
smooth O
the O
performance O
is O
and O
how O
it O
is O
under O
light O
and O
intense O
activities O
. O

Ugly O
design O
, O
confusing O
, O
settings O
all O
over O
the O
place O
, O
split O
personality O
, O
etc O
. O

Use O
: O
just O
plug O
it O
in O
to O
one O
of O
your O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
ports O

Yes O
, O
there O
are O
many O
items O
that O
can O
NOT O
be O
downloaded O
. O

Di O
any O
one O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
this O
battery O
? O

At O
this O
point O
, O
I O
am O
just O
going O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
buy O
the O
Logitech O
USB O
Headset O
or O
buy O
a O
standalone O
mic O
. O

Unlike O
a O
high O
- O
capacity O
replacement O
battery O
I O
bought O
at O
the O
same O
time O
for O
a O
Toshiba O
laptop O
THIS O
battery O
is O
still O
alive O
and O
well O
- O

I O
use O
the O
quick O
access O
pocket O
for O
my O
harmonica O
, O
earphones O
, O
aspirin O
, O
kleenex O
, O
etc.*The O
section O
between O
the O
laptop O
section O
and O
the O
front O
sections O
has O
an O
internal O
divider O
and O
is O
definitely O
big O
enough O
for O
several O
good O
- O
sized O
books O
( O
e. O
g. O
stats O
textbooks).*The O
laptop O
section O
is O
plenty O
roomy O
for O
file O
folders O
or O
a O
good O
- O
sized O
book O
as O
well O
as O
the O
laptop O
. O

Arduino O
works O
equally O
well O
. O

Much O
better O
than O
buying O
new O
from O
HP O
. O

Having O
to O
use O
the O
Fn O
key O
to O
access O
Home O
, O
End O
, O
Page O
Up O
and O
Page O
down O
, O
however O
, O
is O
inconvenient O
and O
slows O
you O
down O
. O

In O
order O
to O
configure O
this O
device O
properly O
, O
it&#8217;s O
best O
if O
you O
also O
have O
some O
knowledge O
on O
networking O
. O

The O
Clear O
QAM O
is O
seen O
by O
Windows O

Media O
Center O
and O
allows O
all O
the O
local O

signals O
to O
be O
seen O
( O
comcast O
cable O
) O
without O
a O
tuner O
box O
or O
security O
card O
. O

As O
I O
said O
above O
, O
it O
does O
quite O
well O
what O
it O
was O
designed O
for O
, O
however O
, O
with O
all O
the O
nice O
portability O
positives O
, O
you O
do O
gain O
one O
large O
disadvantage O
: O
actual O
cooling O
. O

Seemed O
like O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

When O
the O
drive O
is O
inserted O
you O
will O
be O
prompted O
to O

Also O
, O
going O

, O
I O
will O
be O
using O
compressed O

on O
the O

periodically O
. O

Cord O
is O
a O
little O
excessively O
thick O
and O
stiff O
, O
but O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

Weird O
things O
happen O
is O
all O
I O
can O
say O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
these O
Creative O
T12 O
Bluetooth O

will O
also O
takewired O

if O
you O
want O
. O

It O

working O
great O
. O

Love O
the O
size O
and O

of O
this O

- O
Since O
I O
use O
most O
of O
the O
Google O

and O
use O
Andriod O

, O
I O
rarely O
need O

. O

You O
can O
even O
play O
a O
real O

on O
it O
with O
no O

The O
best O

: O
NO O
MORE O

No O

It O

GREAT O

I O
had O

I O
have O
not O
spent O
enough O
time O
with O
these O

on O
this O

yet O
to O
determine O
just O
how O
much O
they O
will O

I O
got O
it O
for O
a O
whole O
lot O
less O
here O
! O

I O
nearly O
bought O
another O
, O
until O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
... O
not O
only O
is O
it O
a O
great O
product O
, O
but O
the O
seller O
has O
a O
vested O
interest O
in O
your O
being O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
, O
and O
makes O
a O
big O
effort O
with O
follow O
- O
up O
e O
- O
mail O
after O
the O
sale O
. O

It O
would O
not O
be O
used O
just O
for O
a O
daypack O
because O
of O
the O

It O
often O

highly O
recommend O
this O
adapter O
... O

I O
also O
noticed O
that O
the O
Transition O
from O
laptop O
mode O
to O
tablet O
mode O
was O
quicker O
than O
the O
Yoga O
1 O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
one O
prefers O
to O
use O
thisbag O
for O
carrying O
light O
, O
thin O
books O
/ O
notebooks O
for O
classes O
or O
conferences O
, O
this O
bad O
works O
well O
for O
this O
purpose O
as O
well O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
way O
to O
add O
a O
third O
monitor O
to O
my O
computer O
. O

10 O
. O
1 O
with O
keyboard O
in O
a O
poetic O
leather O
case O

I O
have O
used O
the O
adapter O
with O
HP O
and O
Dell O
computers O
and O
had O
the O
same O
results O
with O
both O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
was O
quite O
a O
disappointment O
because O
there O
's O
so O
much O
good O
here O
, O
ruined O
by O
ridiculous O
straps O
! O

This O
speaker O
is O
LOUD O
and O
has O
bass O
. O

In O
which O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
cut O
or O
edit O
video O
captures O
or O
run O
extensive O
photoediting O
software O
and O
other O
extensive O
programs O
alike O
. O

so O
I O
purchased O
the O
Nikon O
DSLR O
/ O
laptop O
bag O
from O
Cameta O
Camera O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
saw O
it O
. O

This O
Rosewill O
adapter O
has O
been O
great O
for O
being O
able O
to O
recover O
information O
from O
all O
of O
my O
old O
notebooks O
. O

After O
perhaps O
five O
uses O
, O
that O
never O
happened O
again O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
many O
times O
before O
how O
the O
' O
shortly O
' O
projections O
drag O
for O
months O
and O
months O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
Netflix O
does O
not O
have O
much O
incentive O
to O
be O
in O
any O
hurry O
because O
of O
the O
negligible O
market O
share O
that O
Samsung O
ARM O
- O
based O
Chromebook O
have O
. O

Quick O
deliver O
and O
a O
great O
product O
overall O
. O

that O
's O
why O
I O
bought O
this O
originally O
. O

I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
do O
that O
with O
this O
case O
so O
that O
makes O
me O
happy O
to O
start O
. O

stuff O
like O
phone O
chargers O
, O
pens O
etc O
... O

What O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
: O
I O
set O
out O
to O
find O
a O
laptop O
that O
was O
light O
, O
decent O
graphics O
and O
screen O
for O
gaming O
and O
watching O
HD O
movies O
, O
powerful O
enough O
to O
run O
video O
- O
editing O
and O
image O
- O
editing O
software O
, O
and O
a O
good O
battery O
life O
for O
times O
in O
an O
international O
airport O
where O
all O
the O
power O
jacks O
look O
alien O
to O
you O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
dropping O
$ O
15 O
on O
a O
gadget O
you O
are O
going O
to O
use O
once O
in O
your O
life O
. O

Very O
fatal O
flaw O
is O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
. O

If O
you O
travel O
or O
just O
War O
Drive O
this O
is O
a O
must O
have O
device O
. O

Would O
cost O
the O
average O
person O
1 O
hour O
or O
labor O
uninstalling O
the O
bloatware O
1 O
by O
1 O
just O
so O
the O
PC O
can O
run O
at O
its O
full O
potential O
. O

They O
helped O
me O
to O
do O
a O
proper O
job O
. O

Will O
the O
price O
ever O
drop O
below O
ten O
bucks O
with O
shipping O
? O

Mac O
OS O
X O
Expose O
is O
truly O
a O
benefit O
for O
multitasking O
, O
completely O
removing O
the O
need O
for O
a O
taskbar O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
again O
if O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

Mail O
program O
is O
ridiculously O
crippled O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
even O
read O
mail O
from O
some O
servers O
GMAIL O
for O
example O
( O
over O
IMAP O
) O
. O

Fits O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
perfectly O
! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
make O
a O
hackintosh O
, O
however O
, O
there O
is O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
WiFi O
card O
. O

I O
bought O
one O
of O
these O
for O
my O
best O
friend O
and O
me O
for O
$ O
21 O
. O

It O
is O
well O
built O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

Being O
accustomed O
to O
using O
a O
Core O
i7 O
Elitebook O
with O
an O
SSD O
, O
I O
expected O
this O
machine O
to O
feel O
like O
molasses O
. O

Get O
'em O
while O
they O
last O
because O
this O
system O
is O
there O
for O
the O
taking O
. O

I O
play O
games O
when O
ever O
I O
can O
. O

This O
cable O
has O
the O
figure O
8 O
plug O
, O
which O
does O
NOT O
have O
a O
ground O
. O

Music O
playback O
is O
more O
than O
acceptable O
, O
and O
Netflix O
looks O
spectacular O
. O

( O
Unless O
I O
wanted O
a O
future O
option O
of O
stereo O
) O

Needed O
this O
for O
better O
multitasking O
, O

I O
have O
heard O
good O
things O
about O
the O
support O
. O

However O
, O
it O
has O
a O
strong O
chemical O
odor O
. O

Works O
great O
. O

( O
I O
hate O
touch O
pads O
) O
. O

it O
was O
cheep O
and O
it O
works O
great O

I O
still O
recommend O
the O
cooler O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
have O
a O
beta O
driver O
out O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
loaded O
it O
yet O
. O

fortunately O
it O
worked O
fine O
. O

it O
makes O
my O
tablet O
experience O
better O
, O
especially O
when O
i O
need O
to O
type O
out O
emails O
... O

We O
use O
it O
on O
the O
tablet O
, O
computer O
screens O
, O
and O
phones O
. O

Go O
ahead O
and O
get O
one O
and O
grab O
a O
memory O
upgrade O
while O
you O
're O
at O
it O
. O

( O
Optimus O
will O
not O
work O
if O
the O
second O
graphics O
card O
is O
inserted O
in O
the O
Ultrabay O
port O
) O

It O
's O
considerably O
bigger O
than O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
device O
. O

I O
love O
this O
cooling O
mat O
becasue O
it O
helps O
elevate O
my O
laptop O
and O
keep O
it O
cool O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

This O
will O
do O
a O
better O
job O
for O
protecting O
the O
laptop O

How O
could O
that O
not O
be O
an O
improvement?!This O
speaker O

This O
one O
is O
no O
different O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
this O
all O
the O
time O
but O
it O
's O
in O
my O
laptop O
bag O

I O
did O
n't O
buy O
this O
on O
Amazon O
. O

My O
only O
recommendation O
would O
be O
that O
the O
label O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
removed O
since O
I O
have O
2 O
shirts O
Dry O
Fit O
damaged O
by O
this O
tag O
. O

Great O
price O
! O

The O
black O
case O
broke O
apart O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
an O
Acer O
Chromebook O
and O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
pack O
there O
are O
two O
long O
pockets O
that O
hold O
a O
ton O
of O
batteries O
( O
easily O
48 O
) O
& O
many O
memory O
cards O
( O
there O
are O
four O
little O
pockets O
in O
each O
side O
that O
could O
easily O
hold O
3 O
CF O
cards O
each O
, O
so O

The O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard O
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
LCD O
screen O
on O
this O
device O
is O
nice O
, O
although O
I O
must O
say O
I O
prefer O
the O
brightness O
& O
color O
saturation O
of O
my O
Incredible O
's O
OLED O
screen O
. O

Is O
it O
easy O
to O
use O
? O

I O
found O
that O
the O
microphone O
does O
not O
work O
on O
any O
computers O
or O
programs O
at O
all O
. O

Plays O
CoD O
: O

Looks O
really O
great O
! O

The O
only O
other O
thing O
I O
'd O
ask O
for O
is O
a O
specific O
place O
for O
my O
power O
cord O
. O

Personally O
though O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
bother O
listening O
to O
my O
favorite O
mp3 O
's O
on O
my O
laptop O
, O
I O
have O
a O
Cowon O
S9 O
mp3 O
player O
that O
has O
the O
Best O
Sound O
quality O
you O
can O
buy O
with O
BBE+ O
3 O
. O
0 O
, O
which O
sounds O
better O
than O
anything O
IMO O
. O

I O
tried O
using O
it O
with O
Skype O
and O
the O
person O
on O
the O
line O
said O
that O
they O
could O
n't O
hear O
me O
and O
the O
feed O
back O
of O
what O
I O
was O
hearing O
was O
really O
bad O
. O

I O
know O
its O
not O
my O
Macbook O
, O
because O
I O
actually O
reinstalled O
OSm O
just O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

Good O
for O
home O
use O
. O

The O
rubber O
feet O
on O
my O
Dell O
slowly O
wore O
down O
to O
nothing O
, O
and O
my O
laptop O
ended O
up O
sliding O
around O
my O
desk O
and O
easily O
sliding O
off O
of O
any O
un O
- O
level O
surface O
. O

, O
4 O
GB O
DDR3 O
RAM O
, O
500 O
GB O
5400 O
rpm O
Hard O
Drive O
, O
14-Inch O

It O
is O
very O
roomy O
and O
can O
hold O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

It O
provides O
more O
usable O
keys O
than O
the O
iPad O
alone O
, O
and O
is O
comparable O
in O
feel O
to O
a O
laptop O
computer O
and O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
full O
size O

So O
, O
I O
ordered O
this O
one O
. O

It O
stutters O
and O
looses O
signal O
past O
10 O
ft O
or O
less O
. O

Update O
: O
After O
6 O
weeks O
I O
have O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
isolated O
incidents O
of O
repeating O
keys O
. O

so O
whatever O
$ O
50 O
is O
n't O
that O
much O
. O

The O
touchpad O
buttons O
are O
noisy O
, O
its O
been O
2 O
months O
and O
there O
is O
an O
effort O
to O
do O
the O
right O
clicks O
and O
its O
noisy O
, O
u O
can O
feel O
and O
hear O
the O
button O
press2 O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
know O
if O
it O
's O
CableJive O
/ O
iStubz O
or O
Apple O
and O
their O
silly O
custom O
- O
USB O
- O
to-30pin O
dock O
connector O
games O
? O

2 O
inch O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
sweet O
spot O
. O

the O
cost O
of O
one O
that O
is O
just O
as O
good O
. O

It O
was O
on O
back O
order O
, O
so O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
VERY O
pleased O
with O
this O
laptop O
; O
it O
meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
. O

which O
is O
what O
a O
new O
battery O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

My O
computer O
recognizes O
this O
unit O
as O
a O
multiple O
point O
and O
has O
named O
each O
one O
of O
them O
which O
makes O
it O
really O
easy O
to O
leave O
things O
plugged O
in O
that O
I O
use O
all O
the O
time O
and O
still O
be O
able O
to O
charge O
this O
or O
that O
without O
interfering O
with O
anything O
I O
might O
be O
doing O
. O

It O
's O
easy O
enough O
to O
flip O
the O
drive O
over O
if O
the O
LEDs O
are O
bothersome O
. O

Speakers O
have O
always O
been O
one O
of O
the O
strongs O
points O
of O
Acer O
and O
they O
maintain O
that O
standard O
with O
this O
machine O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
OEM O
power O
supply O
. O

Aesthetically O
, O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
package O
. O

Makes O
adding O
a O
second O
monitor O
simple O
. O

a O
real O
plus O
if O
you O
want O
to O
take O
it O
while O
traveling O
. O

The O
memory O
card O
reader O
arrived O
on O
time O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
to O
power O
a O
small O
car O
cooler O
in O
hotels O
where O
there O
is O
no O
fridge O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
for O
Lepai O
LP-2020A+ O
amplifier O
, O
at O
moderate O
sound O
volume O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
warm O
, O
does O
it O
's O
job O
at O
low O
price O
. O

I O
read O
every O
review O
of O
the O
top O
Android O
Tablets O
. O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
6 O
hours O
for O
the O
price O
paid O
.. O

I O
have O
my O
desktop O
with O
a O
new O
Belkin O
N O
router O
and O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
my O
home O

I O
could O
n't O
resist O
. O

Most O
often O
, O
though O
, O
it O
's O
simply O
noticeable O
. O

This O
fit O
my O
kindle O
perfectly O
. O

The O
third O
one O
I O
had O
was O
excellent O
and O
was O
very O
responsive O
. O

Review O
Update O
: O
Edimax O

On O
my O
house O
wireless O
network O
it O
is O
ok O
in O
the O
room O
below O
, O
but O
out O
of O
range O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
house O
maybe O
40 O
feet O
away O
. O

Ht O
hard O
drives O
that O
I O
have O
been O
using O
extensively O
the O
past O
several O
months O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
record O
ephemeralitiesrather O
than O
writing O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
out O
, O
it O
's O
great O
. O

The O
price O
is O
just O
right O
. O

Belkin O
4 O
port O
USB O
works O
well O
and O
is O
small O

Good O
cable O
, O
does O
what O
you O
expect O
it O
to O
do O
, O
Saves O
having O
to O
type O
in O
a O
bunch O
of O
data O
so O
you O
can O
people O
your O
database O
with O
numbers O
without O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
. O

ST9500xxxx O
which O
worked O
with O
all O
three O
computers O
. O

It O
still O
makes O
your O
lap O
hot O
, O
but O
I O
imagine O
I O
'd O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
if O
I O
have O
a O
non O
- O
heat O
generating O
pillow O
keep O
sitting O
on O
the O
same O
spot O
on O
my O
lap O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

( O
It O
is O
airmailed O
from O
England O
) O

Very O
easy O
upgrade O
to O
do O
. O

That O
laptop O
needs O
a O
case O
which O
makes O
it O
as O
big O
as O
a O
small O
briefcase O
, O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
carry O
it O
around O
all O
day O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
may O
have O
someone O
take O
this O
strap O
off O
my O
old O
pack O
and O
put O
it O
on O
this O
one O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
again O
from O
this O
company O
! O
! O
! O

I O
never O
actually O
used O
it O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
but O
used O
it O
on O
occasion O
in O
the O
car O
. O

Great O
stocking O
stuffer O
for O
just O
about O
anyone O
with O
cords O
and O
chargers O
and O
the O
like O
. O

There O
is O
no O
rear O
facing O
camera O
. O

and O
I O
usually O
let O
mine O
air O
dry O
. O

After O
overcome O
the O
first O
problem O
, O
I O
want O
to O
setup O
the O
print O
- O
server O
, O
it O
take O
me O
longer O
than O
the O
real O
necessary O
time O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
read O
the O
manual O
. O

FM O
( O
no O
commercials).I O
am O
waiting O
desparately O
to O
get O
home O
and O
try O
them O
in O
my O
Windows O

It O
'll O
serve O
as O
my O
main O
University O
machine O
, O
and O
I O
purposely O
chose O
a O
business O
model O
'cause O
they O
tend O
to O
have O
better O
performance O
and O
are O
easier O
to O
upgrade O
. O

and O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

What O
can O
I O
say O
it O
is O
a O
replacement O
LCD O
. O

I O
received O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
a O
MacBook O

We O
used O
to O
be O
a O
Windows O
family O
. O

Using O
the O
Acer O
on O
trips O
has O
been O
excellant O
. O

Cute O
product O
. O

Hope O
others O
do O
nt O
have O
this O
problem O
. O

The O
touchpad O
will O
sometimes O
just O
not O
work O
. O

I O
thought O
people O
were O
over O
reacting O
when O
I O
saw O
comments O
about O
the O
computer O
being O
a O
finger O
print O
magnet O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
true O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O
, O
not O
in O
this O
economy O
no O
sir O

The O
backpack O
is O
impressive O
and O
quite O
and O
improvement O
from O
my O
old O
Canon O
bag O
( O
s O
) O

I O
used O
them O
to O
build O
an O
ammo O
can O
jam O
box O

So O
far O
, O
works O
great O
and O
price O
was O
reasonable O
. O

Great O
sleeve O
for O
the O
money O
. O

Returned O
it O
the O
following O
day O
. O

I O
got O
my O
money O
back O
and O
went O
with O
a O
generic O
adapter O
that O
's O
compatible O
with O
Dell O
laptops O
rather O
than O
an O
official O
Dell O
adapter O
, O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
use O
my O
Palm O
in O
poorly O
lit O
situations O
... O
there O
the O
color O
screen O
is O
a O
delight O
versus O
that O
hideous O
green O
reverse O
backlighting O
. O

So O
this O
thing O
install O
perfectly O
fine O
, O
plug O
it O
in O

It O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
days O
when O
there O
were O
books O
everywhere O
, O
not O

By O
wearing O
them O
this O
way O
the O
tension O
along O
your O
jaw O
and O
around O
your O
ear O
will O
effectively O
dampen O
any O
sound O
transmitted O
along O
the O
cable O
. O

It O
protects O
the O
device O
well O
and O
looks O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
it O
is O
. O

I O
did O
have O
to O
manually O
adjust O
Slingbox O
settings O
to O
be O
below O
the O
default O
screen O
settings O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
most O
of O
the O
reviewer O
's O
+ O
ve O
comments O
on O
this O
model O
. O

Fruit O
Ninja O
and O
Cut O
the O
Rope O
work O
fine O
on O
this O
thing O
, O
as O
do O
all O
business O
apps O
. O

I O
get O
the O
feeling O

I O
have O
never O
had O
one O
but O
always O
knew O
they O
are O
great O
, O
judging O
from O
the O
reviews O
. O

. O

I O
got O
this O
because O
my O
original O
charger O
for O
my O
laptop O
broke O
. O

Love O
this O
messenger O
bag O
. O

one O
was O
horribly O
' O
scratchy O
' O
sounding O
. O

It O
works O
for O
what O
I O
intended O
it O
for O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
any O
of O
the O
problems O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
have O
complained O
about O
, O
but O
I O
also O
did O
n't O
use O
the O
installation O
disc O
that O
came O
packaged O
with O
the O
adapter O
. O

Has O
yet O
to O
fail O
on O
me O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

It O
fits O
fantastic O
and O
in O
the O
front O
zippered O
pouch O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
pink O
asus O
laptop O
. O

the O
IHome O
is O
a O
good O
solution O
. O

It O
turns O
off O
and O
on O
easily O
and O
connects O
immediately O
with O
no O
interaction O
or O
other O
need O
. O

This O
case O
logic O
bag O
is O
what O
I O
would O
call O
a O
computer O
case O
on O
the O
cheap O
. O

Now O
the O
fan O
turns O
on O
and O
off O
as O
expected O
. O

It O
does O
look O
like O
an O
eraser O
, O
not O
very O
large O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
too O
much O
space O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
soo O
cute O
! O

thousands O
of O
viruses.*installing O
applications O
is O
drag O
and O
drop O
. O

No O
matter O
where O
I O
am O
, O
I O
can O
count O
on O
this O
item O
to O
comfortably O
support O
my O
book O
, O
tablet O
, O
or O
keyboard O
. O

: O
It O
might O
be O
faster O
to O
just O
use O
the O
onscreen O
keyboard O
than O
this O
one O
. O

In O
my O
observation O
IS O
did O
not O
work O
that O
well O
as O
it O
works O
in O
my O
Canon O
Hi8 O
camera O
. O

but O
soon O
it O
'll O
just O
give O
out O
. O

Since O
I O
use O
a O
Dell O
U2711 O
on O
my O
PC O
, O
I O
was O
expecting O
this O
monitor O
to O
be O
a O
complete O
joke O
. O

Hot O
swaps O
in O
and O
out O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

They O
do O
exactly O
what O
they O
are O
supposed O
to O
do O
and O
nobody O
around O
could O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

I O
love O
this O
case O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
, O
it O
snapped O
right O
on O
without O
any O
issues O
and O
came O
with O
extras O
, O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
, O
I O
got O
the O
clear O
and O
it O
looks O
awesome O
and O
feels O
great O
. O

Do O
n't O
expect O
much O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
it O
works O
and O
connects O
to O
everything O
just O
fine O
without O
losing O
picture O
quality O
. O

However O
, O
it O
seriously O
stinks O
too O
much O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
my O
Motorola O
Xoom O
. O

Took O
the O
bag O
outside O
, O
turned O
on O
the O
hose O
and O
let O
me O
kids O
have O
at O
it O
! O

Two O
of O
which O
are O
Samsung O
. O

The O
sound O
does O
get O
muffled O
a O
bit O
when O
the O
laptop O
is O
on O
my O
lap O
due O
to O
the O
speaker O
location O
. O

Not O
bad O
, O
I O
may O
have O
to O
buy O
some O
more O
I O
used O
over O
half O
the O
bottle O
already O
. O

The O
do O
not O
tear O
like O
lighter O
weight O
bags O
do O

Overall O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
machine O
for O
the O
price O
and O
is O
very O
light O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
find O
these O
in O
the O
United O
States O
retail O
stores O
. O

Through O
all O
of O
it O
, O
this O
backpack O
has O
held O
up O
extremely O
well O
. O

You O
do O
have O
to O
use O
the O
install O
CD O
to O
first O
see O
the O
drive O
and O
get O
to O
the O
drive O
Web O
Setup O
. O

Now O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
find O
a O
replacement O
. O

This O
Envy O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
carry O
( O
in O
the O
hand O
, O
or O
a O
backpack O
/ O
bag O
) O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
bag O
it O
is O
not O
really O
meant O
for O
portability O
. O

Installation O
was O
a O
little O
tricky O
and O
calling O
tech O
support O
was O
futile O
: O
three O
calls O
resulted O
in O
a O
total O
of O
45 O
minutes O
on O
hold O
, O
one O
disconnect O
and O
one O
no O
answer O
. O

This O
charger O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
best O
compromise O
. O

Awesome O
stuff O
. O

Why O
the O
included O
software O
increases O
the O
signal O
sensitivity O
more O
than O
the O
driver O
for O
WMC O

So O
if O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
use O
your O
computer O
in O
the O
dark O
bedroom O
while O
your O
wife O
is O
sleeping O
, O
you O
better O
know O
where O
your O
keys O
are O
in O
the O
keyboard O
:) O

Good O
unit O
if O
you O
get O
it O
for O
right O
price O
. O

Unless O
there O
is O
a O
specific O
feature O
you O
need O
, O
this O
laptop O
could O
fit O
the O
majority O
of O
people O
's O
computing O
needs O
, O
excel O
at O
most O
of O
them O
, O
and O
even O
provide O
some O
nifty O
, O
state O
of O
the O
art O
features O
to O
put O
a O
smile O
on O
your O
face O
. O

It O
SOUNDS O
TERRIFIC O
! O

If O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
sacrifice O
function O
for O
cuteness O
-- O
if O
this O
speaker O
is O
primarily O
going O
to O
be O
in O
a O
kids O
room O
, O
for O
example O
-- O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
needing O
a O
ready O
supply O
of O
Triple O
- O
A O
batteries O
to O
keep O
it O
going O
, O
then O
the O
" O
Zoo O
- O
Tunes O
" O
speaker O
will O
have O
what O
you O
need O
. O

The O
graphics O
performance O
on O
this O
Macbook O
is O
3 O
- O
5 O
times O
faster O
than O
the O
previous O
Intel O
Integrated O
Graphics O
. O

Inclusion O
of O
a O
low O
profile O
bracket O
saved O
me O
several O
headaches O
! O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Apple O
Store O
and O
paid O
way O
too O
much O
money O
for O
a O
charger O
that O
is O
just O
like O
the O
original O
, O
and O
the O
replacement O
from O
the O
Apple O
Store O
does O
n't O
get O
hot O
, O
either O
. O

On O
the O
outside O
they O
all O
look O
identical O
due O
to O
the O
external O
casing O
which O
surrounds O
the O
internal O
drive O
. O

cheap O
, O
but O
cheaply O
put O
together O
as O
well O
. O

Even O
in O
direct O
sunlight O
it O
still O
looks O
like O
a O
dark O
purple O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
electrical O
interference O
or O
disturbance O
, O
I O
specify O
this O
because O
the O
cable O
passes O
just O
right O
to O
a O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
router O
. O

Changing O
tracks O
and O
volume O
control O
can O
be O
controlled O
by O
the O
connected O
device O
, O
but O
not O
being O
able O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
power O
without O
being O
close O
enough O
to O
reach O
behind O
it O
is O
a O
needless O
inconvenience O
. O

1 O
pro O
64 O
bit O
and O
its O
running O
great O
now O
. O

rubberized O
plastic O
. O

It O
's O
bigger O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
, O
but O
not O
HUGE O
. O

They O
perform O
as O
expected O
and O
the O
external O
volume O
control O
is O
very O
handy O
. O

I O
was O
at O
Best O
Buy O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
replace O
the O
SuperDrive O
in O
my O
27&#34 O
; O
iMac O
with O
an O
SSD O
using O
this O
caddy O
. O

and O
I O
love O
that O
you O
can O
change O
the O
view O
angle O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
would O
have O
been O
cheaper O
to O
order O
a O
power O
cord O
but O
the O
PoE O
may O
surve O
another O
purpose O
down O
the O
road O
. O

I O
use O
Flash O
drives O
a O
lot O
and O
these O
laptops O
only O
have O
2 O
USB O
ports O
, O
so O
this O
turns O
one O
of O
those O
into O
4 O
, O
so O
now O
I O
can O
use O
1 O
for O
the O
Targus O
Lap O
Chill O
Mat O
; O

A O
tremendous O
value O
. O

I O
use O
it O
primarily O
in O
my O
car O
to O
keep O
my O
Android O
phone O
charged O
while O
playing O
Audible O
books O
through O
my O
car O
speakers O
over O
Bluetooth O
. O

This O
product O
was O
poorly O
made O
( O
was O
hard O
to O
insert O
into O
a O
USB O
jack O
) O
and O
did O
not O
ship O
with O
any O
software O
. O

Quite O
a O
few O
people O
had O
issues O
with O
this O

It O
took O
about O
5 O
minutes O
to O
install O
, O
and O
made O
a O
world O
of O
difference O
right O
off O
the O
back O
. O

Total O
savings O
was O
the O
value O
of O
the O
insurance O
( O
$ O
275 O
) O
vs O
the O
value O
of O
new O
items O

Rubberized O
clip O
to O
instantly O
and O
securely O
clip O
to O
any O
laptop O
, O
which O
also O
doubles O
as O
a O
stand O
when O
not O
clipped O
. O

I O
have O
bought O
2 O
of O
these O
cables O
, O
and O
each O
has O
problems O
forming O
a O
secure O
connection O
in O
the O
micro O
USB O
port O
. O

I O
just O
wish O
they O
'd O
be O
up O
front O
about O
these O
facts O
in O
the O
ad O
. O

Implement O
a O
silicone O
gasket O
physical O
mount O
to O
reduce O
conducting O
HDD O
vibration O
into O
the O
computer O
frame O
. O

You O
can O
use O
it O
in O
Guest O
mode O
, O
however O
, O
Guest O
Mode O
is O
like O
an O
internet O
kiosk O
, O
the O
moment O
you O
log O
out O
, O
everything O
is O
gone O
. O

This O
, O
with O
its O
magnesium O
shell O
, O
is O
both O
. O

Yes O
the O
specs O
look O
very O
impressive O
. O

Yeah O
it O
works O
, O
but O
it O
's O
cheaply O
made O
. O

The O
shoulder O
straps O
have O
multiple O
configurations O
, O
and O
one O
thing O
I O
had O
not O
realized O
is O
that O
there O
is O
storage O
in O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
backpack O
for O
any O
of O
the O
shoulder O

( O
I O
already O
tried O
it O
and O
found O
it O
works O
well O
on O
my O
TV O
screen O
, O
too).I O
had O
another O
spray O
that O
worked O
fine O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
foaming O
spray O
and O
tended O
to O
be O
really O
messy O
and O
hard O
to O
control O
. O

So O
far O
my O
desktop O
appears O
to O
be O
running O
stable O
- O
we O
'll O
see O
if O
I O
have O
any O
more O
BSODs O
over O
the O
coming O
weeks O
. O

If O
you O
are O
doing O
anything O
that O
requires O
color O
accuracy O
this O
is O
n't O
for O
your O
, O
but O
for O
editing O
documents O
and O
other O
business O
activities O
it O
works O
great O
. O

although O
nothing O
new O
, O
the O
MagSafe O
connector O
provides O
added O
protection O
when O
someone O
trips O
over O
the O
cable O
or O
if O
you O
accidentally O
' O
run O
' O
away O
with O
the O
MacBook O
/ O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O
4 O
. O

It O
performs O
like O
a O
champ O
and O
can O
breeze O
through O
anything O
I O
throw O
at O
it O
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
and O
the O
price O
was O
right O
. O

but O
it O
kinda O
ugly O
and O
thick.- O

I O
get O
enough O
range O
to O
make O
it O
downstairs O
and O
still O
get O
a O
good O
signal O

The O
video O
works O
great O
, O
love O
the O
extra O
ports O
. O

A O
D. O
A. O
C O
is O
like O
the O
drink O
of O
the O
meal O
, O
some O
prefer O
no O
drink O
while O
other O

require O
a O
drink O

Be O
warned O

those O
that O
want O
to O
purchase O
this O
amazing O

that O
has O
some O
dumb O
flaws.-------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE O

did O
the O

Does O
not O

wish O
this O

came O
with O
AC O

are O
worldwide O

but O
those O

If O
you O
have O
standard O
tinny O
sounding O
laptop O
speakers O
( O
the O
almost O
nonexistent O
kind O
) O
, O
these O
will O
be O
a O
big O
improvement O
. O

Having O

, O
your O

chair O
( O
or O
wherever O
you O
use O
your O
iPad O

, O
would O
be O
good O
... O
and O
its O
size O
would O
probably O
prevent O
it O
from O
being O
easily O
lost O
. O

There O
are O
already O
a O
few O
threads O
hanging O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
reposition O
those O
compartments O
often O
( O
you O
really O
should O
n't O
have O
to O
) O
. O

The O
added O

Researched O
this O
unit O
from O
release O
date O
.. O
Had O
a O
Mac O
Air O
, O
and O
my O
son O
at O
Purdue O
decided O
he O
needed O
it O
for O
his O
Nuclear O
Eng O
class O
more O
than O
i O
did O
... O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
mark O
one O
or O
the O
other O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
help O
you O
remember O
which O
battery O
you O
charged O
and O
which O
one O
needs O
charging O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
desktop O
PC O
user O
and O
graphic O
artist O
, O
so O
I O
wanted O
a O
computer O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
for O
me O
to O
use O
on O
the O
go O
. O

It O
works O
good O
with O
quality O
earbuds O
and O
efficient O
headphones O
. O

I O
use O
this O
to O
maintain O
a O
Carbon O
Copy O
clone O
of O
my O
laptop O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
really O
love O
it O
and O
know O
that O
I O
'll O
get O
years O
of O
wear O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Samsung O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
the O
best O
value O
out O
there O
, O
highly O
recommended O
. O

The O
plastic O
case O
is O
a O
flimsy O
, O
yielding O
plastic O
that O
you O
would O
more O
expect O
from O
a O
Happy O
Meal O
toy O
than O
a O
computer O
peripheral O
, O
but O
it O
does O
its O
job O
. O

I O
have O
great O
expactations O
for O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
used O
off O
of O
EBay O
, O
but O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
computer O
to O
anyone O
out O
there O
. O

that O
I O
will O
have O
a O

would O
be O

Dell O

But O
, O
by O

The O
cooling O
on O
this O

is O
like O
nothing O
on O
any O
other O
gaming O
laptop O
as O
it O
takes O
up O
the O
entire O

of O
the O

If O
it O

unencrypted O

as O
at O

you O
are O

Enough O

It O
is O
Cute O

! O

It O
's O
tempting O
to O
bust O
the O
keyboard O
down O
a O
star O
for O
that O
flaw O
, O
but O
since O
all O
other O
keyboards O
of O
this O
size O
have O
the O
exact O
same O
problem O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
fairly O
deduct O
points O
. O

I O
have O
an O
iPhone O

, O
and O
the O
usb O
would O
n't O
seat O
in O
this O
Belkin O
, O
so O
it O
would O
n't O
charge O
. O

should O
you O
want O
access O
to O
the O
device O
itself O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
block O
any O
of O
the O

everything O

The O
carabiner O

worked O
moderately O
OK O
, O
but O
these O
days O
I O
'm O
not O
using O
it O
with O
a O
strap O
. O

The O
ribbon O
cable O
was O
just O
as O
long O
as O
the O
factory O
and O
that O
is O
a O
huge O
time O

This O

pulls O

The O

nicely O

the O

I O
have O

this O
to O
my O

2 O
of O

I O
bought O
them O

they O

both O
had O

i O
gave O
up O
and O
i O
am O
using O
it O

The O
fact O
that O
it O
can O
be O
compact O
and O
still O
have O
four O

is O
great O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
send O

to O
my O

it O
froze O
like O
crazy O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
it O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
difference O
really O
implies O
any O
inferiority O
of O
the O
Samsung O

. O

worked O
on O
the O
first O
try O

In O
these O
respects O
, O
I O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
. O

I O
think O
I O
'll O
sell O
mine O

My O

When O
I O
upgraded O

this O

, O
I O
can O
immediately O
see O
the O
system O
picking O
up O
the O
upgraded O

... O

It O
works O
as O
mentioned O
in O

reviews O
. O

The O
battery O
delivers O
approximately O
two O
hours O
of O
moderate O
use O
- O
such O
as O
Internet O
browsing O
and O
Skype O

. O

It O
's O
flexible O
so O
it O
will O
easily O
fit O
around O
your O

and O
also O
does O
n't O
get O

Unfortunately O
, O

has O
removed O

for O

, O
the O

is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
if O
you O
open O
it O
up O

I O
had O

The O
very O

is O

tiny O

At O
the O

time O
I O
also O
ordered O
the O

for O

in O
the O
car O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
that O
one O
yet O
. O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
quality O
of O
this O
product O
. O

In O
fairness O
, O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
lots O
of O
car O
- O
power O
adapters O
and O
may O
be O
due O
to O
some O
different O
mechanical O
standards O
for O
these O

. O

You O
'll O
need O
to O
carry O
around O
the O
included O
Mini O

USB O
cable O
. O

It O
takes O
clear O
shots O
and O
records O
video O
with O
clarity O
. O

Amazon O
customer O
service O
has O
also O
been O
outstanding O
on O
this O
and O
many O
other O
items O
I O
have O
bought O
. O

I O
love O
all O
the O
apps O
that O
are O
offered O
through O
Google O
( O
such O
as O
Google O
Docs O
, O
Google O

obviously O
dedicated O

For O
example O
i O
put O
my O
acronis O
trueimage O
dvd O
in O
and O
it O
checks O
the O
internet O
for O
a O
newer O
version O
and O
ask O
me O
if O
i O
want O
to O
install O
the O
latest O
version O
which O
is O
about O
( O
160 O

in O
size O

Would O
really O
like O
a O
charger O
that O
had O
spring O
loaded O
wheels O
that O
could O
retract O
the O
cords O
or O
lock O
at O
certain O
lengths O
. O

If O
I O
knew O
this O
before O
hand O
I O
probably O
would O
have O
went O
with O
a O
Swiss O
gear O
bag O
. O

I O
'd O
used O
more O
expensive O

at O
work O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
need O
all O
the O
bells O

at O

, O
and O
this O
one O
works O
just O
fine O

A O
big O
enough O
screen O
( O
over O
12 O

) O
, O
great O
quality O

. O

so O
now O
onto O
the O
actual O
device O
, O
it O
does O
all O
i O
want O
it O
to O
do O

you O
DO O
need O
to O
point O
the O
remote O
accurately O
. O

Speaking O
of O
lightning O
- O
having O
2 O
thunderbolt O

on O
this O
is O
REALLY O
nice O
at O
work O

The O
third O
replacement O
had O
about O
as O
much O
power O
as O
the O
OEM O
dell O
one O
. O

Check O
your O
cell O
phone O
or O
smartphone O
for O
this O
feature O
. O

I O
assumed O
it O
should O
be O
charged O

recieved O
a O

who O
took O
my O

down O

is O
shipping O

Like O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
people O
the O
sound O
worked O
out O
of O
the O
box O
( O
on O
a O
Windows O
7 O
64-bit O
machine O
) O
but O
the O
remote O
control O
was O
dead O
no O
matter O
what O
I O
tried O
( O
installing O
newer O
software O
, O
playing O
with O
the O

different O

This O
little O
piece O
of O
plastic O
with O
metal O
plugs O
into O
the O
laptop O
if O
you O
push O
real O
hard O
, O
almost O
damaging O
your O
USB O
connector O
in O
the O
process O
, O
then O
it O
does O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O

For O
me O
, O
however O
, O
this O
simply O
means O
that O
I O
connect O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
to O
the O
computer O
to O
use O
instead O
of O
the O
touch O
pad O
. O

The O
unit O
is O
" O
only O
" O
rated O
for O
10A O
, O
which O
is O
actually O
the O
best O
I O
could O
find O
, O
but O
the O
built O
- O
in O
lighter O
socket O
is O
fused O
for O
( O
and O
I O
assume O
rated O
at O
) O
15A. O

This O
accessory O
is O
what O
sets O
the O
Transformer O
apart O
from O
iPads O
, O
other O
Android O
Honeycomb O
tablets O
and O
even O
the O
beefier O
and O
heavier O
Windows O
7 O
tablets O
. O

I O
shipped O
it O
to O
them O
, O
emailed O
them O
the O
cost O
, O
and O
they O
refunded O
the O
money O
and O
sent O
the O
correct O
battery O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
keyboard O
cover O
for O
my O
2011 O
MacBook O
Pro O
13 O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
it O
is O
still O
working O
great O
today O
! O

Would O
be O
MUCH O
better O
to O
have O
them O
on O
the O
left O
AND O
right O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
new O
HP O
Envy O
laptop O
, O
since O
my O
previous O
machine O
got O
quite O
a O
few O
scratches O
on O
the O
screen O
due O
to O
friction O
with O
the O
keyboard O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Roku O
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
but O
wanted O
to O
stream O
some O
network O
TV O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
with O
the O
antenna O
. O

It O
sounds O
silly O
, O
but O
after O
you O
have O
a O
gameboard O
with O
flat O
buttons O
you O
'll O
really O
appreciate O
this O
. O

I O
have O
the O
speed O
and O
reliability O
I O
need O
for O
my O
job O
, O
and O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
how O
thin O
and O
light O
this O
machine O
is O
compared O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
high O
end O
gaming O
laptops O
. O

After O
1 O
week O
of O
waiting O
the O
coolerfan O
arrived O
, O
it O
was O
exactly O
the O
spare O
part O
I O
needed O
, O
so O
the O
problem O
was O
solved O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
a O
great O
feature O
and O
everything O
fits O
right O
; O
no O
need O
to O
cut O
a O
hole O
for O
the O
charger O
or O
anything O
. O

The O
memory O
for O
bank O
( O
A O
) O
for O
the O
M1210 O
under O
the O
keyboard O
took O
about O
5 O
minutes O
; O
it O
was O
easy O
too O
( O
following O
a O
youtube O
video O
) O
. O

did O
n't O
think O
I O
'd O
use O
it O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

I O
also O
wanted O
something O
that O
could O
use O
existing O
usb O
cables O
to O
charge O
devices O
, O
including O
iPad O
or O
Kindle O
Fire O
that O
require O
higher O
wattage O
output O
. O

the O
keyboard O
cover O
is O
nice O
and O
very O
responsive O
. O

But O
it O
also O
keeps O
me O
from O
carrying O
things O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
. O

Do O
n't O
want O
ANY O
power O
connected O
when O
changing O
things O
inside O
a O
computer O
! O

The O
design O
is O
great O
, O
very O
sleek O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
after O
searching O
for O
a O
replacement O
power O
supply O
unit O
and O
thought O
it O
seemed O
like O
a O
good O
price O
as O
well O
. O

Very O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

Touch O
pad O
on O
the O
keyboard O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
and O
I O
can O
so O
far O
access O
all O
of O
the O
same O
functions O
I O
could O
from O
the O
Shield O
's O
own O

The O

that O
operates O
with O
the O

like O
any O

is O
a O

on O

sound O

is O
plagued O
by O
electronic O
interference O
and O
stuttering O

when O

Having O
this O

me O
worried O
that O
a O

will O
lead O
to O

The O

( O
my O
biggest O
gripe O
thus O
far O
I O
use O
the O

all O
the O

) O

Now O
the O
keyboard O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
aspect O
of O
this O
PC O
. O

Oddly O
, O
the O
Pulse O

does O
not O

a O

I O
did O
not O
have O
that O

Your O

and O
spending O
the O
50 O
- O
70 O
bucks O
for O
one O
that O
will O
last O

It O
worked O
in O
helping O
me O
salvage O

the O
hard O

of O

that O

Meanwhile O
, O
my O
Eneloop O

is O
still O
going O
strong O
. O

This O
cooling O
pad O
has O
solved O
his O
problem O
and O
he O
is O
very O
pleased O
. O

I O
like O
the O
packaging O
too O
. O

The O
entire O
PC O
industry O
uses O
the O
same O
crummy O
batteries O
that O
just O
do O
n't O
hold O
up O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
5 O
stars O
because O
the O
functionality O
is O
incredible O
. O

the O
sides O
are O
simply O
too O
short O
in O
most O
areas O
to O
accommodate O
ports O
. O

well O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
i O
got O
the O
large O
to O
make O
sure O
all O
the O
books O
fit O
nice O
inside O
. O

The O
instructions O
are O
not O
clear O
at O
all O
as O
to O
how O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

Bought O
this O
tablet O
to O
used O
as O
my O
portable O
HD O
, O
so O
far O
i O
was O
able O
to O
load O
all O
mi O
pic O
, O
movie O
and O
music O
to O
it O
and O
take O
it O
where O
ever O
i O
go O
. O

This O
was O
a O
extra O
purchase O
to O
help O
me O
protect O
my O
tablet O
while O
I O
travel O
, O
Its O
nice O
because O
I O
can O
put O
my O
tablet O
inside O
in O
its O
existing O
case O
with O
all O
extra O
cables O
etc O
in O
one O
convenient O
location O
. O

This O
battery O
does O
what O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
do O
and O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

, O
I O
am O
now O
on O
my O
fiancees O
computer O
since O
my O
computer O
was O
demolished O
and O
her O
15 O
. O

Wifi O
is O
like O
a O
cordless O
house O
phone O
, O
even O
though O
it O
is O
cordless O
technology O
it O
is O
still O
a O
house O
phone O
. O

UPDATE O
: O
I O
have O
had O
problems O
with O
syncing O
this O
mouse O
, O
but O
mostly O
when O
the O
battery O
gets O
low O
. O

Works O
well O
, O
easy O
to O
store O
, O
easy O
hook O
up O
. O

Too O
many O
of O
these O
are O
way O
to O
wide O
and O
make O
you O
remove O
the O
case O
from O
your O
phone O
or O
iPad O
. O

After O
my O
wife O
starting O
having O
some O
issues O
when O
saving O
Photoshop O
projects O
, O
I O
decided O
it O
was O
time O
to O
upgrade O
our O
Mac O
and O
boosted O
it O
to O
16 O
gigs O
of O
RAM O
with O
2 O
of O
these O
. O

Finder O
: O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
useful O
until O
I O
downloaded O
a O
program O
and O
had O
no O
idea O
where O
it O
went O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
for O
a O
Dell O
Inspiron O
1520 O
running O
Windows O
XP O
SP2 O
. O

Firstly O
you O
need O
to O
know O
what O
you O
are O
buying O
and O
if O
it O
will O
work O
with O
you O
tablet O
. O

I O
've O
been O
carrying O
an O
iPad O
3 O
, O
a O
2008 O
model O
13 O

The O
aluminum O
case O
cools O
it O
well O
- O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
to O
clone O
my O
300 O
GB O
hard O
drive O
to O
it O
( O
takes O
about O
4 O
hours O
on O
a O
Mac O
because O
cloning O
is O
much O
slower O
than O
copying O
) O
and O
the O
drive O
got O
only O
slightly O
warm O
. O

My O
daughter O
replaced O
her O
mini O
laptop O
battery O
, O
which O
held O
zero O
charge O
, O
with O
this O
one O
. O

Screen O
is O
very O
bright O
and O
the O
high O
resolution O
is O
excellent O
. O

Holds O
it O
secure O
, O
protects O
the O
corners O
when O
dropped O
( O
have O
n't O
tested O
this O
feature O
and O
do O
n't O
plan O
to O
) O
, O
stands O
up O
nicely O
at O
different O
angles O
. O

You O
can O
be O
more O
rough O
with O
your O
computer O
because O
it O
has O
no O
moving O
parts O
. O

I O
run O
a O
network O
switch O
into O
the O
gateway O
that O
has O
three O
computers O
and O
a O
network O
printer O
attached O
to O
the O
switch O
. O

What O
I O
like O
best O
is O
the O
battery O
life O
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
brief O
review O
focussed O
more O
on O
migration O
and O
seamless O
operation O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
well O
made O
product O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
a O
second O

and O
I O
think O
it O
has O
more O
then O
enough O
length O
to O
reach O
a O
side O
USB O
port O
. O

I O
was O
tempted O
to O
just O
get O
a O
SSD O
and O
pop O
it O
in O
there O
myself O
, O
but O
I O
figure O
I O
should O
at O
least O
get O
a O
working O
drive O
out O
of O
the O
deal O
. O

If O
you O
search O
around O
the O
internet O
you O
'll O
find O
other O
cases O
of O
the O
intermittent O
power O
cord O
. O

However O
the O
quality O
is O
terrible O
! O

In O
the O
upper O
chamber O
, O
I O
always O
put O
a O
vest O
there O
, O
in O
case O
it O
is O
cold O
somewhere O
. O

On O
3 O
it O
's O
louder O
then O
her O
laptop O
speaker O
on O
high O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

He O
loves O
it O
( O
he O
sent O
a O
cheaper O
, O
lighter O
- O
weight O
Case O
Logic O
one O
back O
in O
favor O
of O
this O
) O
and O
it O
will O
be O
convenient O
to O
have O
the O
checkpoint O
fold O
- O
out O
section O
for O
security O
lines O
. O

in O
example O
i O
have O
my O
ps4 O
, O
ps3 O
, O
xbox O
360 O
connected O
to O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
as O
back O
up O
high O
speed O
cards O
. O

The O
usb O
connection O
is O
n't O
very O
good O
, O
but O
its O
better O
than O
nothing O
... O

Image O
Browsing O

Both O
cords O
however O
are O
of O
great O
quality O
and O
seem O
sturdy O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
gorgeous O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
from O
the O
device O
is O
very O
good O
. O

Whoever O
product O
tested O
this O
thing O
got O
away O
with O
theft O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
when O
setting O
the O
xbox O
to O
720p O
, O
the O
unconverted O
HDMI O
image O
has O
slight O
shadows O
and O
looks O
overall O
a O
bit O
washed O
out O
. O

And O
it O
was O
so O
affordable O
, O
even O
on O
my O
college O
- O
student O
budget O
! O

it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
my O
signal O
but O
only O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
called O
that O
day O
to O
dispatch O
and O
they O
confirm O
. O

but O
it O
def O
eats O
dust O
and O
finger O
prints O

Treble O
and O
bass O
are O
clear O
. O

I O
just O
use O
it O
as O
a O
stand O
when O
I O
'm O
watching O
something O
. O

I O
really O
do O
, O
not O
trying O
to O
gloat O
here O
. O

I O
have O
mine O
on O
the O
hutch O
of O
my O
computer O
desk O
, O
just O
slightly O
above O
ear O
- O
level O
, O
an O
arms O
length O
away O
and O
they O
sound O
great O
, O
and O
you O
can O
actually O
feel O
the O
bass!!Being O
PC O
speakers O
, O
the O
bass O
does O
not O
carry O
far O
though- O
as O
it O
is O
not O
meant O
to O
. O

, O
I O
lost O
one O
to O
a O
hawk O
and O
not O
a O
pleasant O
site O
, O
so O
I O
want O
to O
do O
everything O
I O
can O
to O
stop O
that O
in O
the O
future O
, O
bottom O
line O
is O
buy O
this O
and O
hook O
it O
up O
outside O
if O
you O
want O
or O
watch O
who O
is O
coming O
up O
your O
driveway O
, O
thanks O

The O
little O
pouch O
that O
came O
with O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
fit O
all O
the O
items O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
super O
- O
tight O
fit O
if O
you O
do O
that O

Previous O
off O
- O
brand O
chargers O
have O
given O
me O
problems O
with O
overheating O
( O
both O
my O
laptop O
and O
the O
charger O
itself O
) O
. O

Dependable O
batteries O
that O
last O
a O
long O
time O

A O
little O
heavy O
at O
just O
under O
3 O
pounds O

While O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
extra O
storage O
room O
, O
it O
can O
comfortably O
hold O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
papers O
and O
accessories O
. O

When O
I O
need O
an O
extra O
outlet O
or O
two O
in O
my O
hotel O
room O
, O
I O
now O
have O
this O
Monster O
strip O
to O
cure O
my O
power O
issues O
. O

I O
like O
to O
keep O
everything O

and O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
pay O
toshiba O
's O
prices O
for O
an O
original O
replacement O
. O

The O
fit O
and O
finish O
is O
top O

. O

Only O
okay O
for O
movies O
etc O
. O

Simply O
amazing O
. O

the O
usb O
has O
a O
slot O
inside O
the O

I O
loved O
that O
little O
lappy O
. O

why O
, O
as O
it O
's O
not O
used O
for O
anything O
. O

I O
beg O
to O
differ O
. O

I O
miss O
actual O
dedicated O
click O
buttons O
that O
are O
not O
integrated O
into O
the O
touchpad O
, O
as O
those O
were O
much O
faster O
and O
less O
prone O
to O
accidentally O
move O
your O
cursor O
just O
before O
the O
click O
. O

XP O
boots O
wicked O
fast O
. O

From O
the O
time O
you O
ship O
it O
off O
until O
it O
's O
returned O
is O
about O
2 O
weeks O
. O

i O
know O
a O
few O
verry O
successfull O
youtubers O
who O
use O
it O
daily O
for O
reviews O
unboxings O
rants O
and O
so O
on O
i O
just O
use O
it O
for O
webcaming O

I O
would O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
recommend O
this O
based O
on O
my O
experience O
. O

The O
battery O
, O
though O

I O
've O
owned O
this O
bag O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
, O
and O
it O
's O
replaced O
all O
my O
other O

so O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
small O

it O
would O
be O

to O
go O
with O
a O

As O
an O
aside O
, O
I O
got O
this O
to O
get O
my O

Adjusting O
the O

is O
a O

cumbersome O

workable O

Sometimes O
it O
is O
just O
not O
possible O

, O
and O
when O
that O
is O
the O

this O

is O
the O
answer O

By O
the O
name O
of O
the O
review O
I O
am O
sure O
all O
recognize O
me O
as O
one O
of O
the O
ones O
burned O
by O
HP O

I O
have O
3 O
other O
linksys O
routers O
and O
none O
of O
them O
have O
ever O
or O
currently O
exhibit O
this O
. O

I O
'd O
recommend O
HP O
/ O
Compaq O
to O
anyone O
over O
Dell O
and O
Sony O
. O

Confused O
since O
the O
photo O
on O
amazon O
showed O
no O
such O
ridiculous O
strap O
, O
I O
continued O
to O
examine O
more O
of O
the O
bag O
's O
features O

i O
think O
that O
is O
how O
much O
people O
are O
breaking O
them O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
durability O
yet O
. O

Despite O
the O
good O
ratings O
this O
item O
received O
, O
I O
was O
still O
a O
little O
skeptical O
about O
this O
working O
as O
well O
as O
the O
build O
quality O
. O

Combine O
it O
with O
the O
overall O
feel O
of O
the O
Toshiba O
and O
I O
really O
felt O
that O
the O
Assus O
was O
more O
cheaply O
built O
. O

Good O
Product O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
Laptop O
attache O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
product O
for O
the O
price O
. O

For O
those O
whom O
might O
have O
a O
problem O
, O
uninstall O
the O
device O
from O
the O
system O
device O
manger O
, O
uninstall O
all O
software O
, O
then O
restart O
PC O
, O
then O
reinstall O
only O
the O
drivers O
, O
then O
the O
software O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
not O
going O
to O
replace O
a O
high O
end O
professional O
or O
pro O
- O
am O
Sony O
, O
Canon O
, O
Panasonic O
or O
JVC O
video O
camcorder O
. O

The O
padding O
in O
the O
compartments O
is O
so O
thick O
and O
strong O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
really O
do O
much O
more O
than O
carry O
lenses O
. O

Once O
I O
could O
boost O
the O
sound O
with O
them O
( O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
unit O
) O
, O
I O
was O
impressed O
. O

I O
've O
made O
some O
modifications O
to O
it O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
results O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
wait O
for O
a O
replacement O
to O
be O
shipped O
, O
so O
I O
made O
an O
emergency O
trip O
to O
a O
brick O
and O
mortar O

I O

Nothing O
too O
fancy O
, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
. O

This O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
very O
good O
product O
. O

I O
did O
try O
Motorola O
usb O
charger O
I O
had O
, O
for O
the O
Verizon O
Motorola O
Razor O
Maxx O
, O
it O
also O
charges O
the O
tmo O
note O
2 O
fast O

I O
went O
to O
naboring O
and O
out O
of O
town O
outlet O
stores O
to O
find O
less O
worthy O
computers O
sell O
for O
the O
price O
this O
worthy O
computer O
does O
, O
they O
sold O
this O
computer O
for O
$ O
150 O
- O
$ O
200 O
more O
, O
they O
lost O
a O
sale O
... O

And O
it O
's O
heat O
efficient O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
does O
fit O
all O
the O
HP O
and O
Compaq O
models O
for O
the O
series O
listed O
that O
I O
know O
about O
. O

It O
protects O
my O
computer O
from O
alot O
of O
stuff O
, O
and O
fits O
my O
style O
. O

It O
worked O
very O
well O
and O
was O
not O
a O
compromise O
arrangement O
. O

and O
that&#8217;s O
with O
super O
heavy O
use O
throughout O
the O
week O
. O

I O
have O
a O
TV O
connected O
to O
the O
same O
graphics O
card O
as O
a O
secondary O
display O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
do O
this O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
have O
asked O
for O
a O
better O
computer O
bag O
. O

I O
then O
borrowed O
his O
DVI O
adapter O
and O
monitor O
cable O
to O
use O
on O
my O
laptop O
and O
the O
second O
monitor O
. O

Cisco O
Rocks O
! O

What O
does O
" O
up O
to O
30 O
feet O
" O
mean O
to O
you O
? O

we O
'll O
see O
how O
this O
works O
out O
. O

This O
battery O
will O
raise O
the O
laptop O
on O
an O
angle O
but O
that O
will O
also O
help O
reduce O
the O
heat O
as O
well O
. O

my O
microsoft O
mouse O
uses O
1 O
aa O
battery O
and O
lasts O
for O
a O
year O
. O

The O
case O
is O
good O
for O
scratches O
, O
but O
it O
has O
no O
protection O
against O
small O
drops O
. O

so O
I O
know O
it O
's O
the O
power O
strip O
. O

All O
the O
drivers O
have O
been O
updated O
and O
my O
PC O
and O
thousands O
of O
others O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
- O
the O
dock O
disconnects O
( O
Keyboard O
dock O
) O
. O

Bought O
two O
of O
these O
for O
my O
kids O
laptops O
( O
white O
Macbooks O
) O
. O

The O
Hard O
Drive O
is O
a O
5400 O
RPM O

and O
I O
think O
text O
would O
be O
quite O
safe O
unless O
they O
were O
directly O
behind O
your O
shoulder O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
print O
directly O
from O
the O
computer O
; O
I O
know O
it O
's O
not O
the O
original O
intent O
of O
the O
printer O
, O
but O
hopefully O
once O
I O
find O
the O
right O
cable O
to O
connect O
them O
that O
will O
be O
an O
option O
. O

It O
works O
perfectly O
and O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
. O

Cons:- O
Windows O
7 O
starter O
blows O
. O

It O
's O
been O
working O
flawlessly O
since O
I O
've O
purchased O
it O
. O

The O
keyboard O
has O
no O
distance O
between O
pinky O
keys O
like O
A O
or O
P O
and O
control O
keys O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
this O
notebook O
for O
general O
msft O
office O
, O
email O
and O
web O
. O

It O
seems O
others O
have O
gotten O
good O
copies O
of O
this O
battery O
thus O
the O
good O
ratings O
here O
, O
just O
sharing O
my O
experience O
. O

That O
left O
hole O
is O
too O
far O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
drive O
, O
every O
other O
drive O
( O
and O
faceplate O
) O
uses O
a O
hole O
much O
closer O
. O

it O
is O
small O
, O
but O
has O
some O
weight O
to O
it O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cheap O
piece O
of O
plastic O
. O

but O
it O
averages O
about O
6 O
to O
8 O
hours O
a O
charge O
depending O
on O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O

My O
laptop O
is O
slippery O
when O
holding O
it O
. O

I O
JUST O
DID O
A O
BRIEF O
USE O
OF O
THIS O
SIMPLE O
BUT O
USEFUL O
PRODUCT O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
not O
the O
case O
with O
windows O
8 O
, O
not O
sure O
. O

Replacing O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
something O
that O
will O
give O
many O
people O
pause O
. O

I O
wrote O
this O
insanely O
large O
review O
over O
a O
few O
days O
on O
the O
bus O
during O
my O
lengthy O
commute O
just O
to O
show O
off O
and O
make O
all O
the O
smartphone O
snobs O
feel O
like O
they O
're O
in O
the O
stone O
age O
. O

Amazing O
Boot O
up O
speed O
. O

It O
might O
be O
the O
finest O
backpack O
I O
have O
ever O
used O
in O
my O
life O
. O

: O
this O
laptop O
is O
very O
light O
in O
weight O
for O
its O
specs O
, O
having O
opened O
the O
machine O
, O
it O
appears O
good O
quality O
components O
are O
in O
place O
here O
, O
arrived O
with O
a O
useable O
$ O
1 O
dust O
slip O
cover O
which O
is O
more O
than O
I O
can O
say O
about O
many O
other O
laptops O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
spend O
the O
money O
on O
this O
case O
if O
I O
were O
you O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
'd O
bought O
this O
long O
ago O
! O

They O
fit O
well O
in O
the O
ear O
and O
it O
was O
nice O
that O
they O
included O
3 O
different O
sized O
silicon O
earpieces O
so O
that O
you O
could O
get O
a O
good O
fit O
. O

I O
just O
needed O
something O
for O
my O
Kindle O
Fire O
HD O
. O

Then O
, O
I O
discovered O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
hardware O
issue O
. O

This O
battery O
does O
not O
fit O
properly O
. O

Not O
sure O
it O
is O
great O
. O

You O
will O
not O
have O
a O
nice O
looking O
laptop O
like O
that O
of O
a O
macbook O
or O
a O
sony O
Vaio O
. O

Neither O
of O
these O
were O
serious O
experiments O
, O
I O
knew O
going O
in O
that O
I O
'd O
be O
right O
back O

That O
's O
what O
I O
needed O
, O
and O
it O
's O
working O
out O
well O
. O

While O
the O
legs O
are O
n't O
completely O
pointy O
or O
sharp O
underneath O
the O
bumpers O
, O
there O
is O
narrow O
space O
that O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
pinch O
your O
skin O
when O
kept O
there O
for O
several O
hours O
, O
so O
that O
can O
be O
a O
slight O
issue O
. O

Pushing O
buttons O
gives O
off O
a O
solid O
" O
click O
" O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
they O
will O
come O
off O
any O
time O
soon O
. O

It O
is O
currently O
free O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
only O
a O
limited O
version O
will O
be O
free O
once O
they O
start O
charging O
. O

And O
the O
HP O
Envy O
comes O
only O
with O
Windows O
8 O
, O
so O
I O
tossed O
it O
out O
of O
my O
pick O
- O
list O
. O

You O
have O
to O
put O
some O
effort O
in O
to O
finding O
the O
right O
match O
for O
your O
ears O
... O
but O
that O
's O
what O
makes O
this O
product O
work O
so O
well O
. O

I O
loved O
the O
webcam O
quality O
, O
less O
so O
that O
of O
the O
speakers O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
I O
took O
it O
to O
an O
electronics O
recycler O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
I O
can O
keep O
this O
on O
top O
of O
something O
like O
a O
bed O
or O
blanket O
, O
where O
before O
, O
such O
a O
material O
would O
block O
the O
fan O
, O
causing O
my O
laptop O
to O
overheat O
. O

Kind O
of O
just O
bought O
it O
as O
a O
kool O
little O
extra O
, O
and O
it O
works O
fine O

Norton O
Ghost O
was O
nice O
but O
does O
to O
much O

I O
filed O
the O
plastic O
down O
, O
and O
that O
's O
the O
end O
of O
my O
complaints O
! O

so O
I O
bought O
this O
pack O
for O
both O
my O
Canon O
EF40 O
mm O
and O
Panasonic O
45 O
- O
150 O
mm O
MFT O
lenses O
since O
I O
lost O
both O
lens O
caps O
around O
the O
same O
time O
! O

I O
could O
finally O
ditch O
my O
plug O
- O
in O
speakers O
that O
I O
used O
for O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

Perfect O
fit O
except O
1 O
of O
the O
4 O
screw O
holes O
did O
not O
line O
up O
properly O
with O
the O
SSD O
. O

I O
actually O
like O
these O
features O
... O

Sound O
quality O
, O
reliable O
product O
. O

The O
wires O
fit O
underneath O
and O
are O
very O
easy O
to O
put O
in O
. O

The O
cable O
tip O
and O
AC O
cords O
are O
replaceable O
, O
but O
the O
cable O
END O
onto O
which O
the O
tip O
plugs O
, O
is O
not O
replaceable O
. O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
room O
in O
the O
side O
pocket O
either O
. O

Audio O
received O
and O
given O
is O
great O
though O
. O

These O
color O
changes O
could O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
pronounced O
, O
but O
once O
you O
cycle O
through O
a O
few O
times O
you O
should O
get O
it O
down O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
issue O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
but O
something O
that O
an O
extra O
couple O
of O
inches O
would O
have O
avoided O
all O
together O
. O

I O
got O
this O
as O
an O
experiment O
. O

3 O
for O
use O
with O
Max O
/ O
MSP O
, O
messages O
, O
Photo O
Booth O
, O
etc O
. O

Both O
connect O
right O
away O
and O
do O
n't O
take O
up O
any O
USB O
ports O
, O
as O
both O
are O
built O
in O
. O

Delivery O
was O
fast O
and O
the O
product O
came O
with O

This O

and O
a O
small O
zip O
bag O
case O
that O
feels O
like O
a O
rubber O
velvet O
material O
, O
cleaning O
cloth O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
writer O
's O
perspective O
and O
I O
've O
run O
into O
some O
annoying O
limitations O
. O

The O
one O
disadvantage O
I O
found O
, O
which O
may O
not O
be O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
, O
is O
that O
the O
power O
cord O
plugs O
into O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
unit O
. O

The O
specs O
are O
pretty O
impressive O

Needed O
a O

very O
economical O
and O
easy O
to O

From O
a O
functionality O
standpoint O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
this O
product O
better O
if:1-the O
latches O
to O
open O
and O
close O
it O
were O
more O
comfortable O
to O
use O
, O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
heard O
a O
complaint O
since O
, O
so O
all O
is O
well O
. O

20Some O
general O
thoughts O
: O

Certainly O
not O
all O
day O
, O
I O
would O
imagine O
. O

All O
I O
really O
have O
to O
say O
is O
that O
it O
's O
a O
Wacom O
Intuos O
, O
and O
that O
means O
the O
best O
of O
the O
best O
when O
it O
comes O
to O

It O

what O

I O
give O
it O
a O
five O
star O
because O
it O
does O
what O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

The O
latch O
seems O
secure O
and O
it O
beats O
the O
small O
ziploc O
bags O
I O
used O
for O
sets O
of O
4 O
previously O
. O

I O
just O
wish O
charge O
the O
iPad O
. O

I O
paid O
for O
speed O

I O
saw O
someone O
complain O
about O
the O
touchpad O
but O
the O
sensitivity O
can O
be O
adjusted O
which O
makes O
it O
usable O
. O

The O
cable O
that O
runs O
to O
my O
computer O
is O
permanently O
attached O
to O
the O
hub O

I O
sprang O
for O
the O

. O

If O
I O
find O
this O
to O
be O
an O
issue O
I O
will O
do O
the O
same O
. O

The O
fan O
only O
worked O
for O
a O
month O
, O
but O
as O
the O
DVD O
drive O
did O
n't O
get O
very O
hot O

ac O
compatible O
one O
like O
( O
Intel O
Network O
7260 O
. O

It O
's O
a O
whole O
rigamaroll O
and O
you O
need O
a O
special O
app O
to O
do O
it O
. O

The O
swivel O
is O
good O
and O
definitely O
makes O
it O
convenient O
for O
tight O
spaces O
. O

I O
used O
to O
carry O
a O
sling O
style O
bag O
but O
this O
allows O
for O
much O
more O
flexibilty O
. O

It O
appears O
soft O
to O
the O
eye O
in O
most O
light O
and O
the O
smooth O
lightly O
textured O
surface O
has O
a O
softness O
to O
it O
. O

Most O
games O
I O
can O
pull O
a O
decent O
frame O
- O
rate O
of O
about O
32 O
for O
high O
settings O
and O
63 O
for O
medium O
settings O
. O

A O
nice O
quality O
zipper O
gives O
it O
a O
solid O
feel O
. O

Shipping O
was O
a O
little O
quirky O
. O

i O
bought O
a O
chromecast O
to O
use O
with O
it O
and O
they O
perform O
very O
well O
together O
. O

As O
I O
stated O
before O
, O
I O
've O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
height O
of O
this O
mat O
, O
ever O
. O

I O
recently O
retrofitted O
my O
Samsung O
NC10 O
with O
an O
Intel O
5300 O
dual O
band O
wireless O
n O
card O
and O
3rd O
antenna O
, O
and O
it O
is O
solidly O
showing O
5 O
bars O
, O
as O
is O
the O
TP O
Link O
PCI O
card O
installed O
in O
my O
wife O
's O
computer O
upstairs O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
mouse O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
expect O
Razer O
quality O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
for O
a O
man O
or O
woman O
to O
carry O
. O

I O
dropped O
my O
Macbook O
on O
the O
floor O
while O
it O
was O
in O
the O
case O
last O
month O
and O
there O
was O
zero O
visible O
damage O
to O
it O
. O

( O
You O
'll O
be O
swearing O
like O
I O
do O
now O
when O
that O
happens.)There O
are O
other O
things O
like O
sharp O
edges O
and O
top O
lid O
being O
smaller O
than O
the O
bottom O
one O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
open O
even O
with O
both O
hands O
. O

This O
replacement O
keyboards O
solved O
my O
issue O
, O
a O
keyboard O
with O
an O
intermittently O
failing O
home O
. O

The O
motherboard O
is O
made O
by O
another O
company O
( O
I O
believe O
this O
one O
is O
an O
Asus O
) O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
with O
my O
late O
2013 O
MacBook O
pro O
for O
about O
8 O
- O
9 O
months O
and O
my O
computer O
still O
looks O
brand O
new O
. O

I O
also O
did O
not O
want O

The O
design O
is O
elegant O
and O
quite O
appealing O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
, O
the O
TV O
's O
outstanding O
performance O
is O
what O
I O
like O
the O
most O
.... O

Because O
of O
the O
Holidays O
, O
I O
have O
not O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
connect O
with O
either O
my O
wife O
's O
mini O
iPad O
or O
my O
Nook O
Color O
. O

If O
you O
're O
someone O
who O
stores O
lots O
of O
data O
, O
a O
builder O
or O
a O
hardware O
guy O
with O
lots O
of O
used O
drives O
, O
this O
thing O
is O
really O
useful O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
Acer O
would O
risk O
their O
reputation O
just O
to O
make O
a O
few O
dollar O
profits O
on O
the O
cheaper O
A4 O
chip O
. O

If O
you O
need O
to O
type O
often O
or O
accurately O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
keyboard O
for O
you O
. O

There O
's O
really O
not O
that O
much O
white O
on O
it O
at O
all O
... O
just O
on O
the O
outer O
rim O
, O
so O

I O
used O
the O
RGB O
- O
to O
- O
RCA O
connector O
. O

There O
are O
two O
red O
LED O
lights O

Plus O
I O
only O
have O
to O
carry O
one O
connector O
because O
the O
cell O
and O
kindle O
use O
the O
same O
connector O
. O

TIPS O
: O

Everything O
has O
worked O
fine O
and O
I O
plan O
to O
buy O
another O
128 O
MB O
SmartMedia O
card O
shortly O
. O

With O
that O
in O
mind O
, O
and O
after O
reading O
Speed O
Expert&#8217;s O
comments O
, O
I O
decided O
this O
ASUS O
would O
fill O
the O
bill O
. O

But O
then O
, O
it O
's O
really O
not O
much O
use O
to O
anyone O
else O
, O
either O
, O
because O
it O
only O
has O
a O
capacity O
for O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
ofbasic O
words O
. O

i O
was O
disappointed O
in O
the O
look O
also O
. O

Thus O
you O
had O
to O
spend O
the O
extra O
time O
to O
manually O
pair O
them O
up O
each O
time O

The O
bag O
is O
very O
comfortable O
with O
nicely O
padded O
shoulder O
straps O
and O
a O
nicely O
padded O
back O
. O

That O
's O
nothing O
for O
today O
's O
standards O
. O

The O
media O
controls O
above O
the O
keyboard O
are O
touch O
sensitive O
and O
work O
well O
. O

but O
I O
think O
that O
if O
dropped O
from O
a O
height O
higher O
than O
your O
waist O
you O
might O
still O
damage O
the O
laptop O
. O

Nice O
laptop O
! O

I O
found O
they O
sounded O
best O
if O
positioned O
about O
four O
inches O
from O
my O
ears O
, O
pointing O
to O
my O
ears O
. O

You O
will O
be O
glad O
your O
purchased O
this O
. O

This O
general O
rule O
of O
thumb O
seems O
to O
work O
on O
all O
windows O
devices O
. O

This O
is O
great O
for O
storage O
. O

However O
it O
has O
the O
unique O
feature O
of O
telling O
you O

Let O
me O
start O
with O
saying O
I O
have O
not O
tested O

I O
use O

so O
my O
opinion O
is O
always O
unbiased O
. O

I O
do O
love O
this O
little O
thing O
, O
and O
I O
use O
the O
touchscreen O
much O
, O
much O
more O
than O
I O
expected O
to O
. O

I O
searched O
all O
the O
Macworld O
, O
CNET O
, O
TUAW O
, O
and O
other O
" O
top O
lists O
" O
for O
Mac O
Air O
cases O
and O
pretty O
much O
eliminated O
all O
of O
them O
except O
this O
Booq O
Viper O
. O

When O
they O
replace O
them O
his O
company O
uses O
higher O
quality O
parts O
than O
OEM O
and O
he O
assured O
me O
they O
rarely O
had O
recalls O
for O
" O
cap O
" O
problems O
on O
the O
same O
TVs O
. O

I O
will O
warn O
anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
buying O
one O
that O
this O
is O
not O
for O
those O
who O
need O
to O
replace O
their O
powerful O
PC O
, O
the O
lack O
of O
significant O
hardrive O
space O
and O
Chrome O
's O

will O
frustrate O
someone O
coming O
from O

or O
other O

I O
changed O
the O
rating O
to O
3 O
stars O
because O
if O
the O
3 O
keys O
that O
were O
not O
working O
had O
in O

worked O
this O
would O
have O
actually O
been O
a O

fits O
right O
on O
my O

" O
2011 O
macbook O

. O

The O
wires O
were O
OK O
however O
and O
it O
is O
a O
good O
price O
. O

the O
Bluetooth O
and O
charge O
indicators O
are O
hidden O
by O
the O
iPad O
when O
it O
is O
in O

. O

One O
I O
use O
on O
my O
tablet O
, O
another O
I O
use O
on O
my O

, O

No O
problem O
to O
use O
it O

However O
, O
I O
have O
my O
iMac O

OK O
my O
Toshiba O
is O
a O
bit O
tight O
in O
this O
bag O
. O

While O
I O
have O
noticed O
some O
effect O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
not O
worth O
paying O
a O
higher O
price O
. O

This O
was O
unexpected O
, O
but O
then O
I O
figured O
that O
Microsoft O
being O
what O
Microsoft O
is O
, O
of O
course O
Vista O
partitions O
would O
n't O
work O
on O

... O

, O
it O
is O
adequate O
and O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
. O

Seven O
months O
later O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
that O
my O
only O
critique O
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
the O
touchpad O
can O
be O
finicky.- O
The O

and O
the O
top O
( O
where O
I O
rested O
my O

while O
typing O
) O
was O
very O
hot O

The O
processor O
is O
rather O
sluggish O
with O
the O

which O
is O
shocking O
considering O
it O
runs O

This O

I O
like O
the O
padded O

and O
the O
security O
it O
gives O
me O
when O
carrying O
my O

It O
communicates O
with O
my O
Centurylink O
( O
our O
local O
phone O
/ O
DSL O
company O
) O
wireless O
modem O
and O
also O
my O
Linksys O
wireless O
modem O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
longer O
cable O
to O
connect O
my O
phone O
to O
my O
computer O
and O
a O
longer O
charging O
cable O

I O
use O
the O
speakers O
on O
my O
laptop O
to O
watch O
movies O
/ O
anime O
while O
doing O
other O
things O
. O

There O
are O
actually O
4 O
buttons O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
trigger O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
what O
some O
of O
them O
do O
, O
but O
I O
know O
that O
some O
of O
them O
will O
reactivate O
the O
mouse O
without O
sending O
a O
left O
- O
click O
, O
so O
try O
the O
other O
buttons O
when O
it O
stops O
working O
. O

Not O
as O
good O
as O
my O
Sennheiser O
HD O
600 O
, O
but O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

My O
daughter O
helped O
me O
with O
the O
review O
and O
that O
was O
the O
first O
thing O
she O
noticed O
when O
she O
began O
typing O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
so O
these O
cables O
were O
needed O
and O
do O
the O
job O
! O

but O
i O
see O
why O
they O
are O
soft O
so O
that O
they O
wo O
nt O
scratch O
the O
glass O
when O
it O
is O
folded O
. O

Bought O
this O
to O
add O
a O
Bluetooth O
headset O
to O
my O
PC O
, O
it O
works O
better O
than O
the O
adapter O

came O
with O
the O

I O
tried O
and O
after O
15 O
minutes O
or O
longer O
, O
the O
error O
message O
" O

appeared O
. O

It O
's O
not O
noticeable O
coming O
from O
the O
laptop O
speaker O
if O
there O
's O
any O
ambient O
noise O
, O
but O
you O
will O
hear O
it O
in O
your O
headphones O
. O

It O
would O
be O
helpful O
if O
the O
on O

off O

light O
was O
on O
the O

. O

I O
inserted O
two O
AAA O
batteries O
, O
the O
dongle O
into O
my O
ThinkPad O
T61 O
running O
Windows O
XP O
. O

The O
design O
is O
just O
that O
good O
! O

Not O
only O
are O
the O
mouse O
buttons O
positioned O
badly O
on O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
touch O
sensor O
... O
but O
the O
size O
of O
the O
buttons O
are O
super O
thin O
and O
tiny O
. O

This O
bluetooth O
speaker O
has O
better O
fidelity O
than O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
. O

i O
was O
hoping O
i O
could O
project O
on O
the O
celling O
from O
my O
night O
stand O
with O
the O
lights O
off O
well O
out O
of O
the O
box O

I O
saw O
other O
customer O
's O
reviews O
, O
and O
took O
a O
chance O
with O
this O
pack O
. O

Les O

It O
's O
well O
- O
made O
-- O
the O
zipper O
pulls O
& O
strap O
hardware O
are O
all O
metal O
, O
not O
plastic O
like O
my O
last O
bag O
. O

However O
, O
the O
upper O
compartment O
is O
not O
as O
well O
padded O
as O
the O
lower O
compartment O
; O
therefore O
, O
you O
want O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
put O
anything O
too O
fragile O
there O
. O

I O
use O
this O
to O
diagnose O
charger O
issues O
in O
the O
shop O
. O

On O
my O
trip O
to O
China O
, O
I O
wanted O
a O
replacement O
for O
an O
adapter O
that O
I O
had O
before O
. O

This O
adapter O
works O
great O
, O
much O
better O
than O
a O
name O
brand O
that O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
. O

It O

The O
discount O
promised O
for O
buying O
the O
original O
version O
never O
materialized O
, O
some O
lame O
excuse O
about O
everyone O
is O
getting O
a O
discount O
until O
1 O
. O

Nice O
looking O
, O
lightweight O
and O
with O
many O
useful O
features O
, O
this O
backpack O
has O
much O
to O
recommend O
it O
. O

We O
were O
using O
this O
on O
a O
Mac O
and O
could O
n't O
get O
a O
low O
volume O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O

after O
my O
Neuros O
Recorder O

stopped O
working O
. O

For O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
this O
product O
seems O
like O
it O
was O
made O
to O
fit O
the O
iPad O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
back O
up O
files O
from O
my O
USB O
onto O
my O
external O
hard O
drive O
on O
- O
the O

go O

without O
the O
need O
of O
a O
PC O
or O
Mac O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
last O
year O
's O
model O
of O
the O
dm1z O
and O
it O
was O
simply O
great O
. O

If O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
then O
a O
quieter O
drive O
would O
be O
better O
. O

My O
gripe O
with O
other O
chorded O
portable O
mini O
speakers O
is O
they O
are O
great O
so O
long O
as O
you O
are O
fine O
with O
placing O
the O
speaker O
and O
smartphone O
or O
tablet O
on O
a O
desk O
and O
leaving O
it O
there O
because O
holding O
a O
portable O
speaker O
attached O
to O
a O
smartphone O
or O
tablet O
for O
any O
amount O
of O
time O
is O
awkward O
at O
best O
. O

It O
works O
great O
, O
this O
item O
is O
for O
my O
brother O
. O

I O
am O
also O
delighted O
that O
the O
trackpad O
is O
positioned O
such O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
stray O
hits O
on O
it O
while O
using O
the O
spacebar O
. O

Product O
works O
. O

If O
you O
want O
the O
perfect O
TV O
, O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
theSamsung O
LN46A650 O

My O
only O
complaint O
( O
hence O
the O
4/5 O
stars O
) O
is O
that O
the O
way O
the O
camera O
is O
attached O
on O
the O
clip O
it O
is O
limited O
in O
movement O
. O

This O
case O
is O
small O
, O
light O
, O
and O
has O
all O
the O
well O
- O
thought O
- O
out O
pockets O
and O
area O
to O
store O
everything O
. O

I O
think O
I O
'll O
buy O
another O
one O
of O
those O
. O

Not O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
student O
or O
a O
business O
, O
but O
just O
right O
for O
home O
usage O
exclusively O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
almost O
useless O
to O
me O
. O

I O
love O
my O
laptop O
case O
, O
I O
can O
put O
everything O
I O
need O
in O
it O
! O

The O
performance O
for O
basic O
functions O
is O
greatCons O
( O
all O
minor):- O
They O
partitioned O
the O
hard O
drive O
into O
about O
120 O
GB O
for O
the O
C O
drive O
and O
150 O
GB O
for O
the O
backup O
D O
drive O
( O
with O
only O
100 O
MB O
of O
files O
on O
it O
) O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
adapter O
to O
attach O
my O
Acer O
Chromebook O
to O
the O
projector O
in O
my O
classroom O
. O

Is O
completly O
quiet O
- O
silence O
, O
you O
really O
ca O
n't O
listen O
any O
noise O
from O
it O
. O

I O
have O
the O
500 O
GB O
version O
. O

It O
does O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
equalizer O
/ O
bass O
boost O
button O
, O
which O
can O
make O
things O
sound O
better O
than O
without O
it O
. O

The O
strength O
is O
is O
the O
cloth O
, O
so O
the O
bag O
is O
still O
totally O
functional O
. O

BUT O
-- O
then O
you O
add O
in O
the O
bundled O
software O

A O
must O
have O
if O
you O
own O
a O
netbook O
and O
carry O
it O
around O
with O
you O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
skeptical O
of O
USB O
speakers O
, O
but O
as O
usual O
, O
Altec O
Lansing O
makes O
the O
best O
sound O
equipment O
around O
. O

Ancient O
laptop O
has O
become O
a O
desktop O
for O
kids O
with O
a O
monitor O
and O
keyboard O
, O
needed O
to O
replace O
the O
mouse O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
and O
most O
comfortable O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
on O
any O
bag O
. O

The O
edges O
of O
my O
Lenovo O

Pro O

3 O
in O
stretched O
through O
the O
rounded O
corners O
of O
the O
case O
so O
much O
that O
it O
left O
them O
with O
no O
protection O
. O

Besides O
, O
if O
I O
am O
carrying O
files O
on O
my O
drive O
, O
it O
is O
not O
as O
a O
backup O
but O
rather O
as O
a O
way O
to O
bring O
files O
to O
a O
lecture O
or O
other O
function O
where O
I O
am O
using O
someone O
else O
's O
computer O
. O

Definitely O
the O
built O
quality O
is O
way O
superior O
than O
my O
dell O
pc O
, O
the O
screen O
is O
awesome O
, O
the O
battery O
lasts O
for O
5 O
- O
6 O
hours O
on O
medium O
usage O
, O
can O
go O
for O
it O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
that O
extra O
money O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
update O
their O
drivers O
, O
so O
if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
upgrade O
to O
Windows O
8 O
when O
it O
comes O
out O
be O
prepared O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
machine O
. O

I O
got O
it O
primarily O
for O
use O
with O
myAcer O

The O

has O
an O
ergonomic O
design O
and O
a O
soft O
touch O
finish O
that O
feels O
nice O
in O
your O
hand O
. O

( O
Around O
2 O
Months O
) O

The O
product O
arrived O
on O
time O
and O
in O
good O
condition O

Seems O
to O
work O
perfectly O
fine O
, O
and O
this O
is O
coming O
from O
a O
macbook O
owner O
.. O
the O
mother O
of O
all O

This O
battery O
will O
last O
about O
three O
hours O
on O
my O
Toshiba O
, O
and O
is O
good O
for O
every O
day O
use O

All O
your O
products O
are O
of O
the O
best O
quality O
and O
durability O

ft O
( O
approx).I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
that O
these O
are O
n't O
really O
portable O
. O

Well O
, O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
huuuuge O
laptop O
.. O
this O
is O
the O
one O
. O

I O
tried O
all O
sorts O
of O
tweaking O
with O
the O
monitor O
and O
my O
computer O

I O
am O
attaching O
it O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
cabinets O
to O
free O
up O
some O
space O
. O

There O
's O
a O
few O
things O
that O
make O
this O
the O
best O
backpack O
I O
've O
ever O
used O
. O

This O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
MAC O
IS O
AWESOME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

This O
computer O
looked O
nice O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
have O
your O
MBPro O
in O
the O
case O
, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
perfectly O
matched O
to O
your O
laptop O
, O
this O
one O
was O
not O
. O

Whatever O
that O
means O
. O

This O
little O
pad O
is O
great O
, O
just O
need O
to O
order O
another O
fan O
set O

Within O
six O
weeks O
, O
the O
hard O
drive O
on O
the O
new O
one O
failed O
completely O
and O
was O
replaced O
. O

The O
cool O
- O
running O
Penryn O
processor O
is O
peppy O
and O
highly O
efficient O
, O
and O
I O
appreciate O
that O
it O
still O
has O
an O
ExpressCard/32 O
slot O
( O
which O
I O
can O
populate O
with O
an O
SD O
reader O
, O
if O
I O
like O
) O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
line O
went O
over O
to O
a O
fixed O
SD O
port O
. O

Well O
this O
is O
the O
light O
for O
that O
. O

Just O
a O
word O
of O
warning O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
play O
online O
poker O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
on O
battery O
power O
before O
getting O
a O
low O
battery O
warning O
. O

To O
my O
surprise O
, O
this O
power O
supply O
only O
had O
a O
4-pin O
motherboard O
connector O
, O
and O
my O
mainboard O
needed O
an O
8-pin O
power O
connection O
. O

The O
battery O
that O
came O
with O
my O
little O
Asus O
netbook O
was O
junk O
. O

I O
have O
a O
rather O
old O
laptop O
and O
wanted O
something O
to O
make O
it O
look O
a O
little O
better O
. O

Whenever O
this O
mouse O
finally O
dies O
, O
I O
know O
my O
next O
one O
will O
be O
Kensington O
. O

If O
you O
'd O
like O
an O
Ipad O

like O
device O
but O
need O
a O
full O
keyboard O
, O
too O
, O
or O
you O
need O
to O
stick O
with O
the O
Microsoft O

system O
, O
than O
this O
is O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
overall O

very O
nicely O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
I O
told O
that O
they O
would O
take O
care O
of O
the O
problem O
, O
but O
also O
they O
wanted O
to O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
damage O
so O
that O
they O
could O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
product O
. O

I O
did O
like O
that O
they O
folded O
, O
but O
was O
concerned O
that O
they O
would O
break O
in O
that O
spot O
if O
you O
were O
to O
use O
them O
a O
lot O

I O
recently O
received O
the O
Lowepro O
Roller O
Lite O
Camera O
Bag O
and O
while O
pricey O
it O
is O
a O
well O
built O
and O
rugged O
which O
will O
allow O
a O
camera O
enthusiast O
to O
carry O
a O
camera O

quite O
a O
few O
lenses O
and O
key O
accessories O
in O
a O
well O
organized O
and O
protected O
environment O

I O
believe O
that O
this O
particular O
product O
should O
be O
avoided O
. O

this O
cd O
burner O
does O
n't O
say O
that O
it O
will O

speakers O
I O
opted O
to O
go O
with O
the O
Soundkick O
. O

The O
sound O
overall O
was O
really O
medicore O
by O
itself O
and O
needed O
some O
help O
from O
several O
EQ O
apps O
I O
downloaded O
to O
my O
devices O
( O
sound O
reminded O
me O
of O
my O
old O
Motorola O
EQ5 O
BT O
speaker O
) O
. O

The O
laptop O
pocket O
is O
way O
too O
big O
to O
hold O
' O
todays O
' O
notebooks O
in O
a O
snug O
manner O
. O

There O
is O
a O
similar O
unit O
for O
laptops O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
put O
the O
laptop O
on O
top O

The O
instructions O
do O
not O
tell O
you O
how O
to O
get O
into O
the O
battery O
compartment O
. O

The O
directions O
say O
the O
desktop O
will O
automatically O
start O
and O
transfer O
the O
audio O
recordings O
. O

The O
quality O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
, O
but O
since O
I O
only O
use O
it O
about O
once O
a O
month O
when O
I O
have O
to O
take O
my O
iPad O
somewhere O
with O
me O

This O
is O
a O
great O
item O
. O

There O
is O
nearly O
25 O
GB O
of O
preloaded O
software O
, O
and O
I O
removed O
about O
50 O
% O
of O
which O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
to O
use O
or O
have O
acquired O
previously O
. O

I O
used O
it O
with O
the O
drive O
from O
my O
Lenovo O
Thinkpad O
( O
Ultrabay O
) O
. O

I O
purchased O
and O
returned O
several O
3rd O
party O
replacements O
that O
would O
not O
hold O
a O
significant O
charge O
before O
I O
bought O
this O
one O
. O

She O
now O
gets O
about O
2-hours O
of O
hard O
work O
per O
charge O

I O
have O
n't O
run O
into O
any O
problems O
with O
this O
charger O
. O

Fast O
transfers O
, O
no O
issues O
with O
reliability O
or O
the O
head O
being O
damaged O
. O

I O
got O
close O
to O
May O
2010 O
and O
am O
writing O
that O
I O
now O
need O
to O
replace O
it O
in O
May O
2011 O
. O

I O
needed O
this O
for O
a O
business O
trip O
because O
my O
full O
size O
laptop O
needs O
service O
. O

Notable O
improvements O
from O
the O
model O
I O
bought O
in O
2009 O
include:-- O

The O
keyboard O
looked O
nice O
, O
felt O
nice O
, O
but O
there O
's O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
design O

The O
case O
has O
a O
nice O
feel O
to O
it O
and O
wo O
n't O
slip O
from O
your O
grip O
. O

I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
install O
software O
and O
burn O
files O
and O
documents O
from O
the O
computer O
.... O
exactly O
what O
I O
expected O
! O
! O

The O
unit O
is O
made O
of O
fairly O
cheap O
plastic O
which O
if O
you O
are O
just O
looking O
at O
it O
, O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
notice O
it O
. O

I O
sent O
them O
an O
email O
before O
I O
bought O
this O
battery O
as O
I O
was O
n't O
sure O
it O
would O
fit O
my O
Gateway O
that O
I O
purchased O
fro O
HSN O
a O
year O
ago O
on O
a O
special O
deal O
. O

Today O
, O
I O
plugged O
the O
Kinivo O
back O
to O
my O
laptop O
... O
and O
it O
instantly O
recognized O
my O
MonsterHD O
speaker O
. O

Was O
so O
happy O
to O
find O
it O
fit O
in O
an O
iPad O
case O
for O
protection O
during O
transport O
and O
storage O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
very O
happy O
camper O
. O

8 O
with O
the O
hood O
reversed O
also O
fits O
. O

As O
a O
hiker O
always O
trying O
to O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
weight O
in O
the O
pack O
. O

I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
package O
, O
changed O
to O
the O
included O
low O
profile O
bracket O
for O
my O
low O
profile O
HTPC O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
move O
more O
than O
5 O
feet O
from O
my O
PC O
before O
audio O
on O
my O
headphones O
would O
start O
to O
stutter O
, O
so O
I O
plugged O
it O
into O
a O
USB O
extension O
and O
now O
this O
adapter O
sits O
on O
top O
of O
my O
desk O
just O
underneath O
my O
monitor O
. O

However O
, O
I O
off O
- O
loadfiles O
to O
an O
external O
USB O
hard O
drive O
, O
as O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
unwise O
to O
clutter O
notebook O
drives O
excessively O
. O

Actually O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
assuming O
the O
price O
of O
the O
unit O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
quick O
shipping O
too O
! O

This O
is O
a O
great O
inexpensive O
solution O
. O

THIS O
COVER O
FITTED O
MY O

PERFECTLY O
AND O
THE O
KEYBOARD O
WORKS O
GREAT O
. O

Seller O

not O

All O

for O

and O

etc O
worked O
just O
great O
. O

You O
can O
not O
let O
certain O
things O
slide O
, O
and O
you O
can O
not O
say O
" O
its O
way O
too O
expensive O
" O
without O
looking O
at O
its O
merits O
. O

Toshiba O
's O
sloppiness O
is O
inexcusable O
. O

Though O
it O
does O
allow O
me O
to O
play O
the O
music O
on O
phone O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
sync O
it O
with O
Windows O
Media O
Player O
which O
is O
what O
I O
wanted O
bluetooth O
for O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Cases O
and O
slipcovers O
might O
be O
tough O
to O
find O
depending O
on O
where O
you O
are O
. O

Make O
sure O
that O
you O
are O
running O

bit O
( O
my O

is O
and O
I O
get O
wonderful O

on O
it O
) O
. O

This O
cooling O
unit O
works O
well O
and O
is O
very O
quiet O
. O

For O
close O
to O
20 O
+ O
years O
I O
used O
a O
desktop O
or O

computer O
at O
home O

I O

be O

with O
it O
. O

The O
laptop O
runs O
both O
OSs O
perfectly O
. O

This O
keyboard O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
cheap O
in O
build O
, O
but O
since O
Apple O
no O
longer O
makes O
the O
wired O
mini O
keyboard O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
options O
left O
. O

It O
extends O
the O
wireless O
by O
at O
least O
100 O
feet O
. O

This O
happened O
to O
me O
both O
times O
and O
as O
well O
, O
both O
times O
the O
laser O
pointer O
did O
NOT O
work O
. O

I O
tried O
this O
with O
Fedora O
Core O
20 O
and O
was O
only O
able O
to O
get O
the O
network O
working O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
Case O
Logic O
Notebook O
bag O
EXCEPT O
its O
about O
1 O
. O
25 O
inches O
smaller O
. O

As O
it O
stands O
, O
this O
saga O
is O
over O
for O
now O
, O
but O
I O
simply O
ca O
n't O
recommend O
the O
Vaio O
Z O
as O
a O
notebook O
to O
own O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
be O
without O
your O
computer O
for O
a O
while O
if O
something O
goes O
wrong.*EDIT O

Two O
years O
later O
and O
the O
9 O
cell O
battery O
is O
still O
working O
. O

I O
have O
used O
this O
travel O
battery O
for O
about O
three O
months O
on O
several O
trips O
with O
no O
issue O
, O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
anyone O
who O
uses O
their O
iPhone O
for O
business O
travel O
. O

Why O
is O
the O
pin O
side O
of O
the O
plug O
on O
the O
laptop O
side O
? O

I O
'm O
rating O
this O
a O
3/5 O
because O
I O
have O
connection O
issues O
. O

I O
have O
a O
new O
17&#34 O
; O
laptop O
gaming O
monster O
. O

They O
must O
be O
clearing O
these O
out O
because O
at O
this O
price O
these O
cards O
are O
a O
steal O
. O

For O
the O
price O
I O
really O
should O
n't O
complain O

Subscore O
Intel O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
use O
a O
small O
mouse O
since O
I O
like O
to O
cup O
the O
mouse O
in O
my O
palm O
. O

I O
think O
the O
dream O
of O
a O
great O
, O
non O
- O
buggy O
$ O
250 O
laptop O
was O
probably O
too O
good O
to O
be O
true O
. O

What O
has O
n't O
been O
improved O
is O
battery O
life O
- O
despite O
the O
new O
Intel O
platform O
it O
's O
actually O
slightly O
worse O
. O

The O
plug O
is O
about O
the O
usual O
in O
terms O
of O
size O
, O
which O
can O
be O
an O
issue O
with O
some O
wall O
mounted O
HDTVs O
, O
but O
my O
Panasonic O
has O
the O
VGA O
jack O
on O
the O
side O
. O

For O
my O
purposes O
, O
it O
's O
perfect O

thanks O
a O

But O
, O
the O
keyboard O
may O
not O
connect O
automatically O
when O
turned O
- O
on O
, O
though O
it O
will O
show O
as O
still O
being O
paired O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
if O
you O
want O
something O

Cons:- O
the O
is O
the O
major O
issue O
- O
the O
velcro O
trip O
for O
securing O
the O

stopped O
being O
effecting O
after O
a O
few O
months O
. O

1 O
. O
1 O
star O
off O
, O
simply O
because O
of O
quality O
. O

You O
can O
fit O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
small O
things O
in O
this O
backpack O
but O
it O
bulges O
and O
is O
not O
' O
square O
' O
with O
what O
it O
fits O
; O
for O
example O
if O
you O
load O
it O
with O
textbooks O
you O
will O
run O
out O
of O
space O
far O
faster O
than O
you O
realize O
. O

No O
problems O
since O
. O

I O
figured O
out O
that O
I O
had O
to O
change O
settings O
in O
the O
camera O
to O
have O
it O
work O
. O

This O
product O
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

I O
had O
room O
in O
my O
notebook O
bag O
for O
this O
and O
my O
kindle O
, O
and O
my O
shoulder O
and O
back O
were O
n't O
sore O
. O

The O
keyboard O
is O
backlit O
, O
with O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
single O
LED O
under O
each O
keycap O
, O
making O
it O
bright O
and O
easy O
to O
see O
. O

Carry O
it O
around O
with O
my O
MBP O
inside O
or O
put O
it O
inside O
my O
backpack O

Sadly O
, O
unlike O
the O
more O
expensive O
one O
, O
it O
is O
not O
removable O
. O

I O
have O
one O
exactly O
like O
this O
that O
came O
with O
my O
Hasselblad O
Xpan O
camera O
. O

I O
can O
read O
in O
bed O
with O
this O
length O
too O
if O
I O
forget O
to O
charge O
and O
have O
it O
charging O
while O
I O
am O
reading O
. O

Making O
it O
one O
less O
thing O
I O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
packing O
. O

Audio O
works O
great O
. O

And O
like O
many O
people O
, O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
pare O
down O
the O
amount O
and O
size O
of O
the O
" O
stuff O
" O
I O
have O
. O

The O
best O
feature O
I O
find O
is O
the O
battery O
life O
. O

Back O

Great O

. O

The O
aforementioned O
product O
DEFINITELY O
does O
NOT O
perform O
as O
reasonably O
expected O
. O

The O
construction O
feels O
cheaper O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
warm O
. O

I O
like O
this O
bag O
, O
but O
I O
really O
wish O
it O
had O
more O
and O
better O
- O
designed O
outside O
pockets O
. O

I O
found O
this O
backpack O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
Mac O
friendly O
because O
the O
Mac O
chargers O
can O
fit O
perfectly O
in O
these O
two O
square O
, O
mesh O
pockets O
near O
the O
top O
of O
the O
main O
pocket O
. O

A O
great O
buy O
. O

I O
was O
relieved O
to O
find O
that O
the O
price O
was O
n't O
astronomical O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
disappointing O
that O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
replacement O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

This O
is O
ABSOLUTELY O
NOT O
what O
I O
expect O
for O
something O
that O
accesses O
important O
data O
. O

I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
take O
a O
chance O
on O
" O
possibly O
" O
being O
satisfied O
with O
a O
slower O
drive O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
more O
confidant O
with O
a O
company O
that O
had O
already O
established O
themselves O
with O
SSD O
drives O
and O
were O
releasing O
a O
2nd O
generation O
drive O
that O
improved O
upon O
what O
seems O
to O
the O
the O
industry O
standard O
. O

Orico O
is O
a O
pretty O
reliable O
brand O
too O
. O

I O
built O
my O
computer O
with O
an O
Intel O
Quad O
Core O
9650 O
, O
8 O
GB O
1066mhz O

( O
without O
Cooler O
Master O
Stand O
the O
puter O
runs O
at O
75 O
% O
to O
80 O
% O
of O
max O
for O
both O
internal O
fan O
speed O
and O
temp O
. O

I O
get O
break O
after O
just O
a O
month O
or O
so O
in O
fairly O
standard O
mobile O
use O
, O
these O
guys O
have O
n't O
quit O
yet O
. O

Oh O
well O
! O

I O
actually O
got O
these O
to O
use O
with O
a O
laser O
light O
device O
that O
uses O
this O
type O
of O
battery O
, O
and O
these O
worked O
fine O
, O
so O
I O
would O
presume O
they O
work O
for O
any O
hearing O
aid O
or O
other O
device O
designed O
to O
use O
this O
size O
/ O
type O
of O
battery O
. O

Only O
complaint O
is O
you O
have O
to O
manually O
turn O
it O
on O
/ O
off O
each O
time O
although O
the O
description O
says O
auto O
on O
with O
usb O
power O
, O
that O
function O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
work O
for O
me O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
big O
need O
to O
use O
this O
often O

My O
first O
was O
a O
stand O
for O
my O
iPod O
touch O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
capability O
, O
then O
what O
advantage O
is O
there O
over O
a O
pure O
tablet?$$ O

I O
was O
getting O
this O
one O
for O
my O
grandaughters O

I O
went O
on O
a O
search O
to O
find O
a O
Windows O
laptop O
that O
is O
as O
good O
as O
an O
Air O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
satisfied O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
what O
a O
little O
elevation O
and O
airflow O
can O
do O
for O
laptop O
temperatures O
, O
and O
Cooler O
Master O
does O
it O
with O
stylish O
simplicity O
. O

Bought O
from O
seller O
Anasca O
. O

USB O
receivers O
should O
probably O
not O
be O
used O
as O
a O
permanent O
solution O
. O

I O
can O
not O
comment O
as O
to O
battery O
life O
as O
I O
rarely O
use O
it O
over O
half O
an O
hour O
unplugged O
but O
my O
meter O
still O
shows O
about O
90 O
% O
capacity O
left O
over O
that O
time O
. O

Cabling O
is O
flexible O
and O
they O
stay O
connected O
, O
even O
upside O
down O
. O

Have O
not O
had O
one O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
runs O
smooth O
as O
silk O
. O

Installed O
it O
per O
instructions O
on O
a O
desktop O
computer O
running O
Windows O
7 O
and O
after O
entering O
the O
network O
password O
, O
I O
was O
recognized O
as O
a O
client O
on O
the O
network O
with O
very O
good O
signal O
strength O
and O
access O
to O
the O
internet O
. O

The O
filter O
holder O
really O
helps O
a O
lot O
as O
it O
fits O
my O
Cokin O
P O
series O
filters O
, O
the O
filter O
holder O
, O
and O
also O
the O
round O
filters O
. O

I O
used O
it O
to O
answer O
a O
call O
on O
my O
cell O
phone O
, O
and O
the O
clarity O
of O
the O
sound O
was O
very O
good O
. O

As O
others O
have O
mentioned O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
the O
crunch O
when O
setting O
my O
bag O
down O
too O
hard O
on O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
. O

It O
worked O
and O
now O
all O
is O
well O
. O

It O
is O
light O
; O
the O
screen O
is O
easy O
to O
read O
and O
very O
bright O
, O
and O
everything O
else O
about O
it O
is O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

This O
is O
not O
some O
cheap O
/ O
flimsy O
cable O
. O

If O
you O
're O
just O
using O
this O
to O
work O
in O
OS O
X O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
anything O
else O
. O

Now O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
hunt O
for O
keys O
at O
night O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
high O
hopes O
for O
this O
when O
I O
ordered O
it O
since O
it O
was O
priced O
as O
cheap O
as O
it O
was O
, O
but O
man O
was O
I O
wrong O
. O

This O
adaptor O
fits O
and O
converts O
perfectly O
and O
installs O
in O
seconds O
. O

I O
absolutely O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

Time O
from O
order O
confirmation O
to O
setup O
was O
9 O
days O
. O

Decent O
webcam O
. O

I O
stepped O
on O
the O
last O
adapter O
and O
i O
ca O
nt O
have O
wires O
running O
out O
too O
far O
or O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O
by O
vicious O
bunny O
rabbits O
. O

I O
plugged O
the O
USB O
wireless O
adapter O
into O
the O
R36 O
before O
plugging O
in O
the O
R36 O
to O
power O
it O
up O
. O

It O
's O
got O
a O
very O
sleek O
, O
appealing O
design O
. O

Made O
of O
real O
leather O
and O
tablet O
fit O
perfectly O
. O

As O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
I O
noticed O
a O
trend O
regarding O
this O
Corsair O
RAM O
upgrade O
. O

At O
that O
point O
the O
USPS O
guy O
handed O
off O
my O
item O
to O
my O
neighbor O
in O
front O
of O
me O
, O
even O
when O
I O
said O
& O
# O
34;Its O
Mine&#34;. O
USPS O
is O
a O
poor O
excuse O
for O
service O
. O

The O
battery O
original O
is O
damge O
for O
used O
. O

The O
Dell O
requires O
4 O
. O
62 O
amps O
to O
work O
correctly O
. O

Actually O
have O
two O
of O
these O
for O
my O
10 O
year O
olds O
and O
they O
work O
great O
. O

But O
even O
now O
, O
it O
still O
does O
n't O
register O
, O
frequently O
. O

the O
only O
way O
to O

: O

Also O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
need O
a O
really O
flat O
space O
to O
put O
so O
that O
it O
functions O
. O

a O
little O
bulkier O
than O
I O
wanted O
for O
the O
mini O
. O

I O
guess O
you O
ca O
n't O
argue O
with O
the O
price O
. O

The O
main O
problem O
I O
see O
is O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
hold O
its O
charge O
for O
I O
long O
period O
of O
time O
. O

I O
called O
tech O
support O
and O
was O
assured O
that O
all O
I O
needed O
to O
do O
was O
enter O
the O
key O
number O
from O
my O
Word O
Home O
/ O
Student O
program O
to O
get O
the O
unit O
up O
to O
speed O
( O
so O
to O
speak O
) O
. O

I O
highly O
recomend O
it O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
great O
working O
, O
attractive O
, O
affordable O
laptop O
! O

the O
only O
reason O
why O
people O
might O
have O
issues O
if O
they O
are O
using O
with O
an O
andriod O
device O
is O
because O
the O
software O
might O
not O
be O
capable O
of O
running O
the O
hardware O
your O
plugging O
into O
it O
. O

It O
's O
an O
inexpensive O
computer O
and O
it O
may O
be O
that O
some O
expectations O
were O
out O
of O
line O
but O
here O
are O
our O
first O
thoughts O
. O

Wirelesss O
setup O
was O
also O
very O
easy O
. O

The O
little O
rubber O
cushions O
underneath O
the O
keyboard O
keeps O
it O
in O
place O
while O
typing O
, O
another O
plus O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
cable O
to O
connect O
my O
old O
macbook O
pro O
for O
my O
new O
HD O
led O
TV O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
was O
n't O
bulky O
, O
protected O
it O
well O
, O
stylish O
, O
and O
not O
too O
terribly O
expensive O
. O

My O
old O
laptop O
would O
almost O
burn O
your O
lap O
, O
not O
this O
one O
. O

Easy O
way O
to O
keep O
my O
macbook O
air O
safe O
when O
in O
put O
it O
in O
my O
bag O
! O

My O
only O
drawback O
and O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
4 O
stars O
is O
that O
the O
laptop O
comes O
with O
a O
built O
- O
in O
dvd O
player O
instead O
of O
a O
blu O
- O
ray O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

I O
've O
since O
compiled O
a O
list O
of O
devices O
that O
do O
n't O
do O
5Ghz O
: O

My O
boss O
picked O
these O
up O
for O
my O
desktop O

It O
works O
fine O
farther O
away O
from O
the O
USB O
port O
, O
too O
. O

: O
The O
drivers O
for O
this O
device O
are O
not O
installed O
. O

Good O
size O
for O
basic O
computing O
( O
no O
gaming O
, O
etc O
. O
) O

2 O
GB O
is O
n't O
exactly O
the O
high O
end O
of O
the O
spectrum O
, O
but O
it O
can O
push O
what O
this O
laptop O
was O
designed O
for O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
okay O
to O
settle O
with O
that O
. O

I O
think O
the O
main O
problem O
is O
walls O
block O
the O
signal O
. O

Good O
Battery O
, O
worked O
great O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

The O
only O
benefit O
of O
the O
non O
- O
wireless O
version O
is O
no O
hassle O
with O
battery O
. O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
versatile O
. O

I O
have O
been O
working O
with O
computers O
for O
over O
18 O
years O
. O

Unless O
the O
few O
caveats O
above O
are O
relevant O
to O
you O
, O
highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
find O
the O
touch O
keyboard O
difficult O
to O
work O
with O
( O
although O
Swiftkey O
helps O
a O
lot O
) O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
realize O
at O
the O
time O
this O
would O
be O
shipped O
from O
out O
of O
the O
country O
, O
but O
it O
came O
much O
sooner O
than O
expected O
( O
a O
couple O
weeks O
I O
believe O
) O
. O

Within O
two O
months O
of O
receiving O
this O
laptop O
, O
the O
screen O
would O
go O
blank O
if O
I O
fully O
opened O
the O
lid O
. O

This O
generic O
drive O
installed O
quickly O
and O
within O
20 O
minutes O
, O
Windows O
7 O
was O
installed O
and O
Windows O
updating O
from O
microsoft O
. O

but O
you O
would O
not O
have O
to O
have O
a O
back O
pack O
if O
you O
carried O
this O
. O

Solid O
metal O
build O
of O
main O
case.-- O
Attractive O
little O
thing O
that O
feels O
and O
looks O
like O
a O
miniature O
book O
( O
with O
a O
rounded O
binding O
) O

Really O
, O
24 O
hours O

decent O
mouse O
but O
CONSUMES O
batteries O
like O
crazy O
. O

But O
it O
can O
still O
run O
graphically O
demanding O
( O
and O
fast O
- O
twitch O
) O
games O
pretty O
well O
, O
if O
you O
tune O
the O
game O
settings O
a O
bit O
. O

My O
Sammy O
netbook O
could O
probably O
take O
being O
sat O
on O
, O
my O
Sammy O
Chromebook O
- O
well O
, O
I O
think O
not O
, O
so O
be O
warned O
. O

It O
charged O
the O
keyboard O
like O
always O
and O
was O
recongnized O
by O
both O
the O
computer O
and O
the O
keyboard O
without O
any O
issue O
. O

, O
it O
allows O
two O
inputs O
into O
one O
monitor O
or O
projector O
. O

I O
connected O
a O
terabyte O
hard O
drive O
through O
the O
USB O
port O
. O

I O
hardly O
use O
any O
of O
them O
on O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
like O
this O
keyboard O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
Gigabit O
Ethernet O
port O
for O
a O
hard O
wired O
connection O
, O
and O
increasing O
network O
speed O
for O
any O
data O
transfers O
. O

Also O
, O
when O
listening O
to O
music O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
quickly O
return O
to O
the O
" O
Artists O
" O
or O
" O
albums O
" O
list O
- O

Well O
constructed O
and O
designed O
bag O
. O

There O
are O
many O
offices O
that O
have O
imposed O
short O
timeouts O
on O
locking O
screensavers O
, O
burdensome O
unlock O
procedures O
with O
smart O
cards O
and/or O
long O
and O
complex O
passwords O
, O
and O
chat O
or O
status O
reporting O
systems O
that O
show O
users O
with O
locked O
screens O
as O
" O
away O
. O
" O

so O
I O
ordered O
another O
one O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
because O
of O
the O
signal O
. O

I O
was O
absolutely O
delighted O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
sound O
which O
was O
much O
better O
than O
that O
of O
the O
Audigy O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
it O
has O
is O
Windows O
Vista O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
their O
fault O
. O

Those O
barred O
sides O
make O
it O
easy O
to O
pull O
around O
, O
when O
needed O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
reliable O
and O
trustworthy O
Flash O
drive O
, O
it O
has O
never O
failed O
on O
me O
, O
unlike O
a O
couple O
of O
Kingston O
drives O
that O
my O
friends O
have O
. O

I O
have O
not O
yet O
figured O
out O
if O
I O
can O
somehow O
remap O
a O
key O
I O
'd O
never O
use O
to O
ESC O
. O

and O
it O
does O
n't O
use O
any O
sort O
of O
super O
over O
- O
provisioning O
or O
compression O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

As O
someone O
said O
below O
, O
the O
SSD O
can O
be O
upgraded O
/ O
replaced O
if O
you O
purchase O
a O
kit O
. O

At O
volume O
turned O
halfway O
up O
, O
the O
sound O
became O
scratchy O
in O
one O
speaker O
. O

Unlike O
other O
electronic O
items O
I O
've O
owned O
the O
attached O
rubber O
protective O
caps O
for O
the O
inputs O
on O
the O
back O

I O
looked O
down O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
light O
on O
the O
supply O
was O
off O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
this O
product O
again O
from O
this O
seller O
. O

" O
( O
either O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
13 O
. O

all O
of O
it O
works O
and O
I O
've O
not O
had O
one O
problem O
. O

I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
on O
specs O
and O
reviews O
before O
I O
bought O
this O
and O
my O
efforts O
paid O
off O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
's O
laptop O
whose O
battery O
would O
no O
longer O
hold O
a O
charge O
. O

I O
installed O
the O
driver O
from O
the O
CD O
that O
came O
with O
the O
item O
. O

I O
did O
a O
factory O
reset O
which O
should O
return O
it O
to O
its O
original O
state O
. O

I O
do O
have O
to O
pull O
the O
zipper O
area O
up O
and O
over O
it O
to O
get O
it O
closed O

I O
had O
some O
small O
issues O
putting O
it O
inside O
, O
as O
IDE O
socket O
did O
not O
have O
any O
space O
on O
top O
of O
it O
, O
and O
laptop O
had O
a O
plank O
on O
the O
top O
, O
had O
to O
bend O
it O
a O
bit O
to O
make O
it O
fit O
. O

Has O
a O
smooth O
, O
rubbery O
feel O
and O
is O
more O
of O
a O
& O
# O
34;frosty&#34 O
; O
look O
rather O
than O
clear O
. O

Most O
ultras O
come O
with O
only O
256 O
Mb O
at O
most O
( O
and O
generally O
use O
an O
SSD O
) O
, O
but O
this O
drive O
gives O
one O
500 O
Mb O
of O
storage O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
through O
that O
much O
trouble O
, O
these O
are O
really O
a O
good O
compromise O
between O
most O
of O
the O
junky O
satellite O
systems O
, O
and O
a O
full O
home O
setup O
. O

The O
computer O
( O
palm O
rests O
and O

) O
is O
a O
total O
smudge O
magnet O
because O
of O
their O

This O
is O
a O
great O
backpack O
and O
it O
have O
the O
perfect O
size O
. O

Not O
a O
big O
deal O
considering O
it O
was O
free O
. O

, O
it O
's O
quiet O
, O
it O
keeps O
the O
Core O
i-7 O
cool O
, O
the O
laptop O
does O
n't O
slide O
all O
over O
it O
like O
it O
did O
on O
the O
Belkin O
and O
Logitech O

AND O

PLUGS O
IN O
AT O
BOTH O
ENDS O

I O
also O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
value O
especially O
with O
the O
quality O
touchscreen O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
great O
for O
carry O
on O
when O
flying O
. O

, O
well O
... O
forget O
it O
with O
this O
full O
body O
iPad O
kit O
from O
ZAGG O
. O

it O
's O
something O
I O
can O
live O
with O
. O

and O
yes O
, O
slung O
over O
one O
shoulder O
this O
thing O
is O
heavy O
. O

The O
front O
zippered O
little O
area O
for O
pens O
and O
note O
pad O
is O
not O
as O
useful O
to O
me O
as O
perhaps O
other O
people O
may O
find O
it O
. O

But O
on O
the O
Yoga O
, O
Windows O
8 O
rocks O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
keep O
your O
data O
( O
music O
in O
my O
case O
) O
backed O
up O
. O

No O
extra O
wiring O
as O
I O
can O
play O
it O
from O
via O
a O
single O
wire O
( O
splitting O
into O
USB O
and O
3 O
. O
5 O
jack O
) O
. O

I O
never O
expect O
much O
out O
of O
speakers O
, O
and O
when O
you O
are O
as O
spoiled O
as O
I O
am O
having O
Acer O

. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
better O
if O
centered O
between O
G O
and O
H. O

This O
TV O
is O
not O
well O
made O
, O
and O
not O
well O
supported O
. O

The O
two O
sided O
tape O
is O
super O
strong O
and O
almost O
impossible O
to O
remove O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

Obsolete O
, O
over O
with O
, O
done O

This O

only O
costs O

499 O

no O
idea O
why O
its O
listed O
here O
for O
so O
much O
more O

My O
Review O
-Excellent O
Product O
! O

Well O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
getting O
slower O
, O
but O
software O
was O
getting O
bigger O
and O
more O
bloated O
, O
so O
it O
ran O
slower O
. O

The O
keyboard O
layout O
has O
been O
change O
to O
remove O
these O
three O

but O
then O
why O
get O
a O
laptop O
backpack O
? O

When O
I O
saw O
a O
cooler O
pad O
that O
's O
this O
cheap O
, O
I O
had O
to O
wonder O
if O
it O
was O
even O
going O
to O
work O
- O
and O
from O
all O
the O
reviews O
, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
scared O
at O
first O
. O

I O
got O
the O
iBook O
back O

The O
second O
is O
the O

the O

The O
ONLY O
frown O
here O
( O
and O
this O
is O
only O
a O
frown O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
the O
system O
on O
your O

) O
is O
the O
blinking O
light O
indicating O
that O
the O
phone O
is O
charged O
and O
the O
bluetooth O
active O
, O
but O
if O
this O
really O
bothers O
you O
, O
you O
can O
just O
put O
a O
sticker O
or O
piece O
of O
tape O
over O
the O
light O
like O
I O
did O
. O

Closing O
the O
cover O
should O
kill O
the O
BT O
. O

so O
things O
like O
your O
wireless O
mouse O
USB O
can O
safely O
sit O
in O
the O
USB O
port O
without O
potentially O
damaging O
pressure O
. O

Not O
much O
to O
it O
- O
the O
USB O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
. O

the O
external O
USB O
plug O
- O
in O
for O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
makes O
it O
an O
instant O
wired O
network O
. O

Since O
flash O
memory O
is O
always O
improving O
, O
no O
point O
in O
paying O
top O
dollar O
for O
something O
that O
'll O
be O
surpassed O
soon O
. O

It O
has O
a O
blue O
light O
on O
it O
that O
looks O
kind O
of O
cool O
if O
you O
're O
into O
that O
type O
of O
thing O
, O
I O
generally O
keep O
it O
off O
but O
its O
all O
about O
preference O
. O

I O
dabbled O
shortly O
with O
a O
4 O
GB O
Kingston O
Data O
Traveler O
, O
but O
the O
flimsy O
plastic O
loop O
on O
it O
broke O
within O
48 O
hrs O
of O
use O
, O
and O
now O
sits O
unused O
in O
a O
desk O
drawer O
. O

Perfect O
for O
infrequent O
use O
! O

At O
the O
beginning O
I O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
trouble O
using O
the O
configuration O
utility O
supplied O
with O
the O
card O
. O

And O
the O
cord O
for O
the O
Netbook O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
looking O
quality O
! O
! O
! O

and O
cue O
closing O
credits O
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
that O
Toshiba O
because O
of O
it O
, O
the O
Dell O
is O
so O
much O
better O
. O

I O
trust O
corsair O
for O
basic O
needs O
in O
this O
case O

Good O
price O
, O
good O

no O

This O

the O

I O
guess O
I O
can O
toss O
this O

in O
my O

My O
Dell O

overheats O
terribly O
. O

My O
only O
issue O
is O
the O
keyboard O
spacing O
, O
I O
wish O
the O
keys O
were O
n't O
so O
cramped O
. O

money O
well O
spent O

I O
use O
a O
USB O
cellular O
internet O
and O
GPS O
combo O
card O
most O
of O
the O
day O
on O
my O
unit O
and O
have O
found O
it O
takes O
2 O
. O
5 O
watts O
to O
run O
it O
thus O
reducing O
the O
runtime O
using O
the O

I O
could O
not O
get O
a O
clear O

. O

Allowed O
me O
to O
hook O

The O
only O
complicated O
thing O
about O
it O
was O
the O
directions O
-- O
ignore O
them O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O

and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
close O
call O
between O
this O
one O

but O
ultimately O
I O
chose O
the O

The O
CEO O
positions O
his O
service O
as O
an O
advancement O
vs. O
the O
" O
first O
generation O
[ O
of O
support O
] O
in O
which O
people O
either O
came O
to O
your O
house O
( O
some O
even O
took O
pictures O
of O
your O
kids O
) O
, O
you O
left O
your O
computer O
off O
at O
a O
store O
for O
a O
week O
giving O
the O

complete O
access O
, O
or O
you O
sat O
and O
watched O
for O
3 O
hours O
while O
someone O
had O
complete O
access O
remotely O
. O

However O
, O
once O
you O
get O
it O
home O
and O
try O
to O
use O
it O
, O
a O
few O
design O
flaws O
become O
apparent O
, O
and O
then O
quickly O
grow O
to O
be O
annoying O
. O

Crystal O
clear O
, O
soft O
and O
lightweight O

this O
product O
looks O
great O
on O
my O

For O
the O
price O
[ O

35 O
] O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

It O
's O
a O

and O
it O
charges O

Samsung O
tried O
literally O
to O
reinvent O
the O

and O
failed O
miserably O
. O

My O
Dell O
D610 O
fits O
easily O
with O
ample O

Same O
exact O
number O
. O

Sturdy O
and O
perfect O
protection O
for O
my O

on O

. O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
another O
backpack O
or O
another O
sling O
bag O
. O

The O
netbook O
feels O
solid O
and O
I O
do O
not O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
breaking O
or O
falling O
apart O
. O

After O
installation O
, O
none O
of O
my O
USB O
devices O
worked O
, O
including O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
. O

Suddenly O
what O
one O
reviewer O
here O
discribed O
as O
the O
" O
Cadillac O
of O
laptops O
" O
could O
be O
had O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
Chevy O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
quality O
sleeve O
that O
is O
n't O
made O
of O
cheap O
- O
quality O
neoprene O
, O
this O
should O
work O
nicely O
. O

I O
have O
always O
enjoyed O
using O
Targus O
products O
, O
they O
have O
been O
very O
reliable O
for O
me O
and O
this O
hub O
is O
no O
exception O

Got O
it O
before O
expected O
, O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
2ms O
response O
is O
great O
. O

-Unlike O
most O
anything O
else O
on O
the O
market O
. O

If O
I O
adjust O
the O
balance O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
right O
, O
no O
sound O
comes O
out O
at O
all O
. O

The O
" O
cradle O
" O
is O
just O
odd O
because O
you O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
while O
charging O
, O
unless O
you O
put O
your O
phone O
in O
upside O
down O
! O

It O
could O
be O
better O
packaged O
. O

The O
keyboard O
seems O
nice O
and O
responsive O
, O
as O
does O
the O
touchpad O
which O
is O
not O
multitouch O
by O
the O
way O
. O

I O
was O
originally O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
couple O
audio O
splitters O
, O
but O
came O
across O
these O
piggyback O
cables O
. O

I O
waited O
too O
long O
and O
will O
now O
keep O
it O
. O

After O
reading O
my O
Sandisk O
warranty O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
I O
was O
not O
impressed O
. O

The O
retractable O
10 O
" O
cable O
makes O
it O
ideal O
for O
laptops O
and O
other O
portable O
devices O
( O
netbooks O
, O
tablet O
computers O
, O
etc O
. O
) O

My O
ventures O
into O
the O
electronics O
shops O
to O
play O
with O
the O
Macbook O
brought O
me O
into O
contact O
with O
netbooks O
... O
and O
was O
I O
amazed O
at O
their O
price O
! O

Also O
, O
when O
clicked O
, O
it O
often O
moves O
the O
cursor O
and O
therefore O
changes O
the O
position O
of O
the O
click O
. O

plug O
it O
in O
, O
power O
it O
all O
the O
way O
up O

It O
's O
easily O
tied O
for O
the O
best O

can O
buy O
for O
your O
gaming O
laptop O
, O
equaled O
only O

. O

The O

cleverly O
swivels O
around O

to O
orient O
the O
device O
the O
way O
you O
want O
it O
. O

" O

with O
plenty O
of O

to O

My O
HP O
has O
1GB/80 O

, O
but O
it O
cost O
me O

Everyone O
has O
an O
opinion O
about O

I O
got O
a O
good O
deal O
from O

and O
ordered O
a O
new O
battery O
and O
new O
power O
adapter O

I O
tried O
updating O
the O
driver O
, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
change O
anything O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
talk O
much O
about O
my O
dentures O
( O
False O
Teeth O

. O

Amazingly O
enough O
, O
Sony O
does O
n't O
give O
you O
a O
ton O
of O
bloatware O
to O
take O
up O
your O
precious O
storage O
space O
. O

Very O
good O
quality O
RAM O
, O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
it O
. O

but O
once O
she O
charged O
it O
and O
plugged O
in O
her O
ipod O
we O
were O
all O
impressed O
by O
the O
sound O
coming O
out O
of O
this O
thing O
! O

Hot O
like O
if O
it O
's O
on O
your O
lap O
and O
you O
're O
wearing O
shorts O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O

It O
lasts O
a O
long O
time O
so O
very O
happy O

It O
's O
a O
very O
nice O
design O

the O
way O

fits O

it O

has O

We O
've O
been O

we O
are O
as O

This O
problem O

been O
corrected O
and O
full O

The O

displays O
on O
both O

quite O
well O
- O
no O
problems O
at O
all O
. O

Have O
been O
using O
it O
daily O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
at O
all O
. O

but O
I O
do O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
battery O
is O
bigger O
that O
it O
allows O
room O
underneath O
for O
my O
laptop O
to O
cool O
. O

I O
am O
very O
, O
very O
pleased O
because O
now O
I O
have O
the O
mobility O
and O
enough O
energy O
in O
that O
laptop O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
the O
adapter O
is O
so O
small O
that O
you O
could O
lose O
it O
if O
you O
remove O
it O
from O
the O
computer O
. O

Even O
the O
power O
adapter O
is O
small O
( O
these O
are O
powered O
off O
of O
a O
wall O
outlet O
, O
not O
USB O
) O
. O

I O
am O
still O
using O
a O
small O
bath O
town O
to O
cover O
my O
machine O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
it O
. O

so O
it O
looks O
like O
nothing O
will O
slip O
out O
. O

I O
have O
3 O
Plantronics O
headsets O
that O
work O
with O
my O
cordless O
phone O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
to O
use O
them O
with O
my O
Galaxy O
S4 O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
complaints O
on O
the O
mic O
quality O
. O

Take O
that O
time O
and O
you O
'll O
be O
rewarded O
by O
having O
all O
your O
peers O
think O
you O
are O
some O
smart O
tech O
guru O
when O
you O
get O
done O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
AR190 O
over O
this O
, O
and O
you O
can O
view O
that O
review O
that O
I O
wrote O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
trouble O
with O
it O
for O
over O
a O
year O
, O
and O
the O
image O
quality O
and O
sound O
are O
terrific O
. O

Edit O
one O
: O

Also O
, O
battery O
life O
is O
pretty O
identical O
to O
the O
advertised O
specs O
. O

You O
made O
me O
look O
to O
my O
son O
, O
like O
I O
actually O
knew O
what O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
for O
once O
. O

Wired O
into O
the O
free O
USB O
port O
of O
the O
TV O
. O

It O
is O
way O
faster O
than O
my O
Dell O
laptop O
, O
mainly O
when O
starting O
up O
, O
or O
waking O
up O
. O

I O
was O
nervous O
at O
first O
about O
switching O
to O
a O
mac O
given O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
very O
knowledgable O
about O
I. O
T. O
and O
that O
I O
work O
a O
lot O
from O
home O
and O
on O
the O
road O
and O
need O
to O
edit O
and O
send O
MS O
Office O
documents O
and O
remote O
connect O
to O
my O
work O
PC O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
worried O
that O
the O
gate O
agents O
might O
say O
something O
about O
it O

The O
Asus O
is O
a O
square O
, O
flat O
, O
brushed O
metal O
finish O
while O
the O
HP O
has O
an O
elegant O
curved O
style O
with O
a O

etched O
into O
it O
... O
win O
: O
HP O

I O
use O
it O
daily O
and O
it O
has O
been O
everything O
I O
expected O
and O
more O
. O

Sold O
my O
Bose O
Companion O
2 O
's O
for O
these O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

Well O
i O
must O
say O
i O
had O
to O
protect O
my O
investment O
when O
i O
buy O
an O
expensive O
machine O
i O
must O
protect O
it O
to O
the O
highest O
and O
also O
i O
must O
get O
something O
that O
makes O
it O
look O
the O
best O
, O
something O
that O
does O
nt O
hide O
its O
beauty O
and O
slimness O
and O
this O
case O
did O
just O
that O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
USB O
connector O
and O
plugged O
it O
into O
an O
outlet O
overnight O
with O
the O
Nest O
and O
the O
problem O
was O
solved O
. O

Nope O
, O
because O
my O
android O
then O
is O
upside O
down O
and O
while O
the O
screen O
rotates O
, O
most O
apps O
including O
the O
clock O
app O
I O
use O
do O
n't O
rotate O
180 O
degrees O
... O

It O
was O
completely O
blank O
( O
needed O
fdisked O
before O
I O
could O
do O
anything O
with O
it O
) O
, O
very O
quiet O
, O
and O
fairly O
clean O
( O
just O
a O
few O
spots O
on O
the O
label O
that O
showed O
any O
signs O
of O
handling O
. O

I O
've O
applied O
this O
to O
my O
Ipod O
, O
but O
I O
was O
n't O
too O
keen O
on O
applying O
this O
to O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
, O
worrying O
about O
getting O
water O
into O
the O
computer O
and O
voiding O
the O
warranty O
. O

And O
searching O
for O
the O
cover O
boxes O
when O
you O
need O
to O
put O
them O
away O
( O
where O
do O
those O
go O
? O
! O
) O

After O
looking O
on O
Samsung O
's O
website O
, O
we O
decided O
on O
this O
one O
on O
Amazon O
. O

The O
only O
issues O
that O
I O
have O
with O
any O
Ultrabook O
is O
the O
closed O
nature O
where O
you O
ca O
n't O
remove O
the O
battery O
or O
upgrade O
memory O
or O
hard O
drive O
. O

wrote O
a O
longer O
review O
but O
my O
internet O
service O
provider O
played O
the O
fool O
......... O

The O
keyboard O
action O
is O
just O
about O
perfect O
for O
me O
and O
keeps O
my O
typos O
to O
a O
bare O
minimum O
! O

This O
was O
ordered O
as O
a O
replacement O
battery O
for O
my O
Mother O
's O
laptop O
. O

Only O
when O
it O
's O
plugged O
into O
both O
the O
wall O
and O
computer O
. O

* O
Great O
battery O
life O
. O

Makes O
this O
a O
fairly O
useless O
device O
. O

For O
me O
that O
's O
perfectly O
acceptable O
since O
I O
'm O
usually O
not O
multitasking O
in O
this O
use O
, O
but O
it O
looks O
like O
there O
's O
enough O
headroom O
to O
open O
a O
web O
page O
or O
two O
. O

Should O
a O
new O
defect O
arise O
within O
a O
year O
, O
I O
'll O
update O
this O
review O
. O

I O
have O
several O
traditional O
laptops O
and O
an O
HP O
Ultrabook O
to O
compare O
this O
to O
, O
and O
it O
does O
quite O
well O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
always O
run O
it O
full O
speed O
. O

Again O
, O
not O
a O
big O
quibble O
, O
if O
it O
sockets O
nicely O
I O
'd O
prefer O
too O
long O
to O
too O
short O
, O
and O
the O
cost O
( O
11 O
$ O
with O
next O
day O
shipping O
) O
more O
than O
offsets O
any O
minor O
gripes O
. O

Other O
notes O
: O
all O
the O
various O
ports O
are O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
machine O
( O

The O
shoulder O
strap O
on O
the O
older O
run O
had O
a O
decorative O
strip O
of O
matching O
brown O
leather O
running O
down O
the O
length O
of O
the O
canvas O
main O
strap O
( O
decorative O
, O
since O
the O
strap O
already O
comes O
with O
a O
leather O
- O
lined O
shoulder O
pad O
) O
. O

I O
have O
a O
G73 O
and O
two O
desktops O
one O
of O
them O
with O
an O
I7 O
- O
2700k O
and O
the O
other O
one O
with O
I5 O
- O
750 O
, O
I O
use O
them O
mostly O
for O
gaming O
and O
stuff O

Tried O
to O
email O
Acer O
. O

Guess O
which O
ones O

Gives O
good O
protection O
for O
surface O
pro O
against O
knocks O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
lag O
, O
or O
hover O
presses O
yet O
. O

it O
's O
perfect O
for O
bringing O
my O
laptop O
with O
me O
on O
the O
go O
! O

Yet O
even O
if O
your O
device O
comes O
with O
a O
high O
current O
charger O
, O
many O
devices O
allow O
for O
charging O
with O
a O
computer O
's O
USB O
port O
- O
meaning O
that O
they O
must O
be O
rated O
to O
only O
draw O
upwards O
of O
500mA. O

skype O
happiness O
- O
Mac O
OS O
X O
is O
really O
really O
really O
easy O
to O
understand O
. O

The O
speed O
difference O
is O
amazing O
! O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
calibrate O
or O
configure O
anything O
to O
get O
the O
mouse O
working O
under O
Linux O
. O

They O
stick O
very O
well O
, O
but O
can O
also O
be O
repositioned O
. O

I O
have O
one O
criticism O
of O
the O
speed O
switch O
. O

and O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
not O
purchased O
it O
. O

Must O
say O
, O
I O
'm O
quite O
impressed O
. O

There O
were O
2 O
main O
issues O
that O
plagued O
me O
with O
this O
tablet O
. O

The O
processor O
is O
n't O
blistering O
but O
is O
certainly O
good O
to O
very O
- O
good O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
made O
in O
Vietnam O
, O
not O
that O
other O
place O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
a O
magic O
bypass O
to O
get O
shows O
that O
a O
cable O
or O
satellite O
subscription O
would O
get O
. O

so O
I O
am O
hopeful O
this O
one O
will O
last O
longer O
. O

The O
Stereo O
effects O
also O
sounded O
pretty O
good O
for O
a O
small O
speaker O
with O
the O
speaker O
drivers O
positioned O
so O
closely O
together O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
moved O
the O
cord O
would O
pull O
slightly O
putting O
the O
laptop O
to O
battery O
and O
then O
back O
to O
AC O
. O

Much O
to O
my O
relief O
, O
salvation O
has O
come O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
LaCie O
706018 O
USB O
External O
Floppy O
Drive O
. O

I O
never O
got O
that O
far O
yet O
. O

One O
complaint O
/ O
annoyance O
I O
had O
was O
that O
in O
the O
setup O
, O
I O
was O
required O
to O
have O
a O
Microsoft O
account O
which O
I O
do O
n't O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
. O

Logitech O
has O
managed O
to O
take O
this O
idea O
and O
do O
it O
one O
better O
, O
improving O
the O
interface O
and O
adding O
a O
built O
in O
screen O
for O
useful O
information O
. O

I O
read O
on O
someone O
elses O
review O
that O
you O
have O
to O
use O
the O
usb O
cord O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
any O
bad O
experiences O
with O
Logitech O
mice O
. O

I O
just O
want O
a O
simple O
little O
laptop O
that O
lets O
me O
explore O
the O
web O
from O
the O
comfort O
of O
somewhere O
other O
then O
my O
computer O
desk O
. O

( O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
laptop O
as O
some O
sort O
of O
miniature O
DVD O
media O
server O
) O

All O
of O
those O
fancy O
features O
in O
the O
upgraded O
editions O
use O
more O
CPU O
time O
and O
more O
memory O
. O

There O
's O
plenty O
of O
storage O
for O
everything O
, O
books O

Bought O
this O
even O
though O
I O
have O
a O
system O
provided O
online O
for O
work O
that O
is O
very O
sensitive O
to O
dropping O
the O
internet O
on O
wi O
- O
fi O
. O

Works O
great O
, O
The O
original O
plug O
that O
came O
with O
the O
laptop O
used O
to O
separate O
all O
the O
time O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
when O
I O
'm O
driving O
to O
work O
, O
it O
's O
dark O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
too O
long O
before O
I O
leave O
it O
on O
all O
day O
. O

Using O
GeekBench O
to O
benchmark O
before O
( O
8 O
GB O
) O
and O
after O
( O
16 O
GB O
) O
there O
was O
actually O
a O
* O
slight O
* O
performance O
decrease O
( O
even O
across O
numerous O
re O
- O
tests O
) O
, O
but O
I O
have O
been O
running O
OSX O
10 O
. O

with O
VMs O
of O
Windows7 O

Here O
's O
what O
I O
love O
about O
this O
netbook O
: O

I O
have O
found O
this O
useful O
as O
I O
jog O
from O
the O
affordable O
parking O
to O
the O
main O
campus O
on O
occasion O
, O
both O
out O
of O
necessity O
as O
well O
as O
prudence O
here O
and O
there O
. O

Seems O
to O
hold O
up O
well O
at O
only O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
OEM O
product O
. O

This O
bag O
fits O
my O
square O
14 O
inch O
HP O
laptop O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
tight O
. O

The O
DVD O
button O
is O
pretty O
tough O
to O
operate O
without O
contorting O
your O
fingers O
awkwardly O
. O

So O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
rush O
or O
forget O
to O
close O
the O
main O
compartment O
zipper O
, O
your O
computer O
is O
fairly O
secure O
. O

this O
has O
several O
strain O
relief O
features O
and O
has O
thicker O
insulation O
as O
well O
. O

It O
is O
nt O
just O
a O
sticker O
, O
its O
made O
of O
the O
same O
stuff O
car O
decals O
are O
made O
out O
of O
. O

For O
that O
reason O
, O
I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
purchasing O
the O
Blue O
Snowflake O
instead O
. O

I O
purchased O
what O
I O
considered O
a O
quality O
converter O

Nicely O
made O
item O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
small O
, O
cute O
speaker O
set O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
use O
with O
her O
iPod O
touch O
( O
she O
's O
four O
, O
if O
you O
're O
wondering O
) O
. O

OK O
for O
basic O
web O
browsing O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
the O
HP O
Pavilion O
dv6 O
and O
the O
touchpad O
on O
that O
machine O
is O
terrible O
, O
it O
lags O
or O
does O
n't O
respond O
at O
all O
sometimes O
. O

The O
product O
arrived O
fast O
and O
was O
exactly O
as O
stated O
. O

The O
' O
naked O
' O
or O
transparent O

of O
the O
case O
. O

Superior O

design O

even O
when O
gaming!- O
Excellent O
LED O
display O
- O
great O
for O
watching O
HD O
videos O
and O
Blu O

movies- O

I O
like O
all O
of O
the O
built O
- O
in O
organizers O
. O

the O
zippers O
busting O
so O
this O
case O
should O
aleviate O
that O
problem!!!The O
mediocre O
rating O
scared O
me O
but O
the O
2 O
1-star O
ratings O
were O
one O
instance O
of O
a O
damaged O
product O
( O
understandable O
) O
and O
the O
other O
was O
from O
someone O
claiming O
the O
laptop O
would O
not O
fit O
but O
evidently O
did O
not O
realize O
there O
is O
an O
adjustable O
petition O
in O
the O
laptop O
compartment O
! O

Try O
editing O
video O
on O
it O

I O
highly O

this O
product O

The O
product O

reflects O
the O
realities O
of O
having O
limited O
desk O
space O
and O
the O
need O
for O
a O
creative O
solution O
. O

At O
low O
volumes O
the O
sound O
quality O
was O
ok O
and O
they O
did O
not O
impress O
me O
in O
particular O
when O
hearing O
at O
my O
office O
, O
but O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
pumped O
up O
the O
volume O
to O
see O
what O
they O
could O
do O
, O
and O
they O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectationsd O
.. O

) O
. O

in O

started O
to O
disintegrate O
. O

oh O
man O
that O
makes O
mmo O
's O
basically O
one O

. O

I O
have O
a O
MBP O
late O
or O
early O
2011 O
13&#34 O
; O
and O
this O
works O
great O
. O

This O
product O
includes O
a O
telescoping O
stick O
antenna O
. O

It O
has O
this O
App O
called O
Radiotime O
which O
is O
really O
neat O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
with O
my O
Pentax O
K O
- O
r O
, O
and O
I O
can O
control O
my O
camera O
easily O
from O
10 O
- O
15 O
feet O
away O
. O

The O
yellow O
does O
n't O
show O
through O
the O
grille O
as O
much O
as O
pictured O
. O

So O
far O
this O
has O
n't O
been O
an O
issue O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
be O
not O
being O
able O
to O
access O
a O
network O
or O

It O
's O
just O
measures O
the O
room O
luminance O
and O
compares O
it O
to O
the O
suggested O
ISO O
standard O
. O

We O
were O
both O
really O
surprised O
about O
how O
good O
it O
sounds O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
and O
does O
what O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O

After O
six O
months O
or O
so O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
touch O
interface O
was O
no O
longer O
responding O
( O
to O
pen O
or O
finger O
) O
along O
the O
right O
or O
bottom O
edges O
in O
portrait O
mode O
... O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
product O
. O

I O
saw O
this O
in O
a O
magazine O
and O
just O
had O
to O
have O
it O
. O

It O
fits O
like O
it O
was O
factory O
- O
fit O
. O

Although O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
remove O
the O
PC O
for O
inspection O
, O
the O
bag O
can O
easily O
be O
unzipped O
for O
viewing O
the O
camera O
and O
accessories O
without O
the O
screener O
having O
to O
remove O
them O
. O

If O
you O
need O
to O
carry O
either O
more O
gear O
or O
more O
than O
just O
a O
few O
papers O
then O
you O
need O
to O
get O
a O
bigger O
bag O
. O

Amazon O
were O
great O
in O
sending O
a O
2nd O
one O
which O
I O
got O
in O
one O
day O
.. O
but O
THATone O
TOO O
had O
black O
stains O
on O
it O
( O
the O
pad O
is O
pink O
to O
match O
the O
deep O
rose O
and O
purple O
OPI O
laptop O
) O

The O
cable O
is O
short O
and O
easy O
to O
store O
. O

At O
first O
I O
would O
use O
it O
just O
for O
gaming O
a O
few O
hrs O
a O
day O
and O
the O
sound O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
.. O

The O
new O
hinge O
cover O
is O
finished O
nicely O
though O
, O
looks O
like O
brushed O
metal O
. O

Webcam O
is O
like O

It O
's O
great O
for O
when O
you O
want O
to O
take O
a O
nice O
leisurely O
bath O
or O
when O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
outside O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
and O
listen O
to O
music O
. O

When O
I O
first O
opened O
it O
, O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
let O
it O
charge O
for O
about O
8 O
- O
10 O
hours O
. O

Would O
recommend O
this O
to O
others O
. O

Having O
the O
drive O
partitioned O
already O
will O
make O
the O
installation O
a O
lot O
easier O

Toshiba O
has O
had O
in O
the O
past O
a O
good O
name O
for O
computers O
, O
but O
when O
I O
bought O
this O
model O
, O
I O
found O
that O
it O
was O
slower O
than O
my O
last O
XP O
computer O
, O
an O
ACER O
netbook O
. O

This O
case O
definitely O
does O
not O
" O
fit O
like O
a O

It O

This O

gets O
all O
the O
major O
channels O
, O
ABC O

CBS O

FOX O

and O
NBC O

but O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
have O
someone O
walk O
you O
through O
it O
first O
to O
get O
a O
little O
confidence O
. O

I O
am O
incredibly O
impressed O
with O

but O
I O
have O
no O
experienced O
any O
of O
the O
negative O
comments O
. O

I O
called O
tech O
support O
and O
they O
agree O
. O

On O
both O
sides O
at O
the O
bottom O
their O
is O
small O
zippered O
compartment O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
zippered O
compartment O
the O
size O
of O
a O
paperback O
book O
on O
the O
back O
. O

Bought O
it O
, O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
, O
and O
no O
complaints O
so O
far O
. O

These O
stands O
were O
very O
well O
with O
the O
lite O
speakers O
that O
came O
with O
my O
Vizio O
Surround O
bar O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
drive O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
not O
for O
the O
poor O
build O
quality O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
I O
could O
hike O
500 O
miles O
with O
this O
in O
my O
pack O
; O
taking O
up O
20 O
% O
of O
my O
allowable O
weight O
. O

Has O
the O
iPad O
pocket O
as O
well O

It O
is O
very O
quick O
and O
so O
far O
handles O
all O
the O
applications O
I O
use O
with O
ease O
. O

; O
's O
suddenly O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
a O
month O
later O
.... O
now O
we O
had O
2 O
pieces O
of O
junk O
and O
a O
horrible O
first O
experience O
with O
tablets O
. O

On O
the O
second O
day O
the O
volume O
was O
very O
low O
, O
using O
flash O
drive O
or O
mp3 O
player O
, O
and O
it O
stayed O
that O
way O
even O
though O
I O
had O
recharged O
it O
. O

It O
was O
well O
- O
packaged O
and O
was O
shipped O
in O
a O
timely O
way O
. O

My O
old O
laptop O
died O
, O
and O
I O
needed O
to O
get O
the O
files O
copied O
over O
to O
my O
new O
laptop O
. O

Bottom O
button O
is O
set O
to O
move O
your O
webpage O
" O
backward O
" O
. O

No O
problems O
with O
it O
so O
far O
. O

Feel O
free O
to O
ask O
any O
questions O
. O

But O
I O
did O
play O
some O
music O
with O
it O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
was O
very O
nice O
. O

It O
works O
great O
for O
putting O
into O
another O
carrying O
bag O
. O

The O
time O
required O
to O
charge O
the O
battery O
my O
be O
a O
bit O
longer O
than O
some O
of O
the O
more O
expensive O
chargers O
but O

Digging O
through O
my O
box O
of O
older O
flash O
" O
media O
" O
I O
found O
2 O
PNY O
Micro O

. O

The O
battery O
life O
... O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
short O
side O
, O
( O
not O
as O
short O
as O
my O
17 O
" O
HP O
Mediacenter O
Laptop O
from O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
... O

Item O
is O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
at O
the O
time O
. O

yes O
i O
m O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O

I O
gave O
it O
to O
one O
of O
the O
Jordanian O
Army O
sergeants O
when O
I O
left O
because O
his O
modem O
was O
messed O
up O
and O
he O
could O
n't O
connect O
to O
the O
internet O
, O
but O
when O
he O
plugged O
this O
into O
his O
computer O
he O
could O
again O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
take O
care O
of O
and O
is O
durable O
. O

but O
that O
is O
in O
a O
laptop O
with O
more O
ram O
faster O
motherboard O
and O
64 O
bit O
windows O
7 O

However O
, O
these O
guys O
should O
test O
batteries O
before O
shipping O
. O

I O
was O
going O
to O
purchase O
the O
macbook O
pro O
15 O
inch O
. O

WELL O
DONE O
Amazon O
! O

The O
snugness O
is O
n't O
a O
bad O
thing O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
minded O
just O
a O
tad O
more O
room O
. O

loaded O
my O
micro O
SD O
card O
with O
photos O
of O
my O
summer O
trip O
and O
about O
700 O
songs O
with O
no O

The O
Bag O
of O
Holding O
is O
great O
, O
and O
definitely O
holds O
up O
to O
its O
namesake O
- O
it O
holds O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
( O
13 O
" O
, O
but O
room O
for O
a O
17 O

, O
Mouse O
, O
cables O
, O
kindle O
, O
pens O
/ O
pencils O
, O

, O
and O
several O
books O
with O
room O
to O
spare O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
size O
, O
it O
runs O
very O
smoothly O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
great O
, O
and O
i O
have O
no O
problems O
with O
the O

speed O
. O

Nice O
dual O

( O

) O
. O

The O
pearl O
white O
model O
is O
really O
pretty O
, O
battery O
lasts O
about O
5 O
hours O
, O
and O
almost O
silent O
comparing O
to O
the O
Dell O
laptop O
that O
my O
husband O
has O
. O

This O
product O
was O
provided O
for O
review O
by O
Accessorise O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
a O
budget O
battery O
again O
, O
I O
've O
learned O
my O
lesson O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
bass O
, O
or O
an O
over O
all O
cleaner O
sound O
( O
and O
you O
have O
decent O
headphones O
) O
, O
the O
E6 O
is O
a O
good O
little O
amp O
to O
try O
, O
and O
it O
's O
cheap O
. O

So O
much O
better O
than O
the O
USB O
crud O
I O
had O
before O
... O

Why O
it O
takes O
a O
crazy O
procedure O
like O
this O
to O
fire O
up O
a O
new O
battery O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
... O

I O
'm O
not O
so O
sure O
the O
blocking O
of O
the O
vents O
is O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
case O
or O
with O
the O
unit O
itself O
- O

It O
is O
sleek O
, O
shiny O
, O
elegant O
, O
and O
I O
have O
received O
a O
lot O
of O
compliments O
! O

The O
Remote O
Works O
just O
Fine O
. O

I O
was O
using O
an O
old O
blackberry O
pug O
and O
the O
contacts O
became O
to O
loose O
to O
function O
. O

Do O
n't O
know O
when O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
sure O
I O
will O
use O
it O
again O
someday O
. O

Do O
u O
make O
cell O
phone O
batteries O
? O

Price O
was O
OK O
, O
but O
would O
have O
expected O
it O
to O
last O
longer O
. O

its O
a O
win O
- O
win O

But O
it O
sure O
looks O
good O
in O
the O
box O
...... O

and O
you O
're O
wanting O
something O
flashy O
and O
comfortable O
to O
hold O
, O
get O
this O
mouse O
now O
! O
! O
! O
! O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
padding O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
balance O
between O
a O
slim O
case O
and O
a O
protection O
. O

I O
revise O
my O
rating O
to O
one O
star O
for O
the O
excellent O
remote O
, O
tuner O
and O
on O
screen O
displays O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
I O
love O
Crucial O
since O
they O
are O
absolutely O
known O
for O
their O
reliability O
but O
this O
is O
n't O
the O
fastest O
read O
/ O
write O
SSD O
in O
the O
world O
. O

It O
works O
well O
with O
your O
iPhone O
( O
and O
as O
a O
charger O
for O
your O
iPod O
too O
) O
. O

so O
I O
can O
connect O
to O
the O
projector O
at O
church O
for O
power O
point O
use O
. O

Now O
I O
make O
it O
a O
habit O
to O
take O
it O
out O
of O
my O
netbook O
every O
time O
and O
place O
the O
USB O
receiver O
in O
its O
spot O
on O
the O
underside O
of O
the O
mouse O
. O

My O
main O
disappointment O
with O
the O
speaker O
is O
the O
sound O
quality O
- O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
provide O
more O
punch O
and O
clarity O
of O
tone O
based O
on O
the O
size O
and O
cost O
, O
yet O
I O
found O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
n't O
that O
great O
at O
full O
volume O
, O
and O
at O
less O
than O
full O
volume O
the O
sound O
is O
fairly O
weak O
. O

There O
is O
a O
protected O
pocket O
for O
a O
cell O
phone O
, O
and O
another O
for O
business O
cards O
. O

The O
adapter O
is O
collecting O
dust O
in O
the O
box O
it O
came O
with O
unfortunately O
. O

It O
was O
like O
watching O
a O
badly O
dubbed O
movie O
! O

It O
had O
a O
75 O
% O
charge O
when O
shipped O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
take O
long O
for O
me O
to O
put O
it O
on O

THIS O
FAN O
WORKS O

Grabbed O
this O
item O
to O
replace O
a O
friends O
Toshiba O
unit O
that O
had O
gone O
kaput O
. O

I O
use O
them O
on O
my O
desk O
at O
work O
and O
they O
are O
perfect O
. O

I O
just O
keep O
it O
in O
the O
usb O
port O
in O
my O
laptop O
and O
use O
it O
as O
a O
quick O
transfer O
tool O
if O
I O
need O
to O
give O
someone O
a O
CAD O
drawing O
or O
the O
like O
. O

The O
extra O
tips O
that O
come O
with O
it O

for O
a O
very O
long O
use O

having O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
set O
of O
tips O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O

It O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
very O
well O
thought O
out O

It O

with O

The O
mesh O
plate O
pops O
open O
and O
you O
are O
able O
to O
pop O
them O
out O

I O

having O
to O
unplug O

it O
back O

multiple O
times O
during O

I O
highly O
suggest O
a O

Honestly O
my O

from O
my O
Fujifilm O
HS25EXR O
came O
out O
better O
, O
especially O
in O
lower O

It O
had O
good O

such O
a O

speaker O
, O
but O
not O
booming O
bass O
( O
this O
is O
not O
a O
negative O
because O
no O

produce O

) O
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
figure O
out O
why O
. O

Best O
money O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
spent O
on O
a O

Decent O

The O
shipper O
/ O
seller O
was O
fast O
and O
the O
product O
is O
great O
. O

This O
is O
a O
well O
made O
product O
I O
purchased O
to O
speed O
up O
the O
security O
process O
at O

. O

Love O
the O

I O
most O
always O
have O
my O
earbuds O
in O
when O
using O
my O
netbook O
so O
I O
generally O
do O
n't O
hear O
it O
. O

But O
to O
others O
whome O
have O
had O
products O
like O
this O
before O
, O
buy O
two O
so O
you O
have O
your O
back O
- O
up O
. O

do O
they O
produce O
less O
heat O
or O
dissipate O
heat O
better O
( O
what O
seems O
to O
kill O
most O
of O
them O
) O
? O

Mine O
fell O
off O

a O

once O
( O
4 O
- O
5 O
' O

) O
, O
and O
the O
only O
damage O
to O
the O

was O
that O
the O

popped O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
difference O
would O
be O
between O
a O
SSD O
and O
a O
Hybrid O
when O
I O
got O
the O
ST500LM000 O
beyond O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
hybrid O
has O
a O
sizable O
chip O
to O
store O
data O
in O
it O
's O
cache O
, O
theoretically O
making O
it O
faster O
than O
a O
regular O
drive O

One O
day O
I O
said O
, O
& O
# O
34;forget O
this O
nonsense!&#34 O
; O
and O
I O
jumped O
on O
Amazon O
and O
purchased O
the O
first O
one O
I O
saw- O
which O
was O
this O
cord O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
worst O
connection O
was O
with O
a O
matching O
Belkin O
N O
router O
, O
but O
that O
was O
the O
junk O
router O
's O
fault O
. O

The O
price O
is O
cheap O
, O
but O
the O
product O
works O
as O
it O
should O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
my O
previous O
backpack O
that O
was O
lost O
. O

I O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
have O
the O
power O
switch O
under O
the O
cover O
, O
where O
it O
ca O
n't O
accidentally O
be O
activated O
- O
it O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
case O
instead O
. O

But O
then O
I O
saw O
the O
same O
things O
from O
MeidaLink O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
the O
battery O
would O
not O
charge O
above O
2 O
% O
about O
a O
week O
after O
the O
return O
date O
expired O
. O

I O
picked O
up O
this O
camera O
backpack O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O

This O
little O
computer O
is O
what O
I O
've O
wanted O
in O
a O
PC O
for O
years O
: O
fast O
, O
fanless O
, O
quiet O
, O
and O
compact O
. O

I O
am O
impressed O
with O
how O
quiet O
it O
is O
, O
but O
agree O
with O
others O
who O
've O
commented O
about O
the O
blades O
. O

conf O
file O
. O

Although O
it O
's O
plastic O
, O
it O
's O
well O
built O
, O
slim O
, O
and O
finished O
to O
look O
like O
brushed O
aluminum O
. O

I O
love O
all O
of O
the O
features O
of O
this O
mouse O
, O
especially O
the O
tiny O
usb O
receiver O
and O
" O
almost O
frictionless O
" O
scroll O
wheel O
mode O
. O

No O
error O
log O
. O

There O
's O
padding O
both O
front O
, O
back O
, O
sides O
, O
and O
some O
limited O
padding O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

For O
such O
a O
small O
, O
battery O
powered O
speaker O
, O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
really O
good O
. O

I O
keep O
this O
guy O
in O
my O
laptop O
bag O
and O
use O
it O
regularly O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
rate O
at O
a O
5 O
is O
because O
of O
the O
cabling O
. O

The O
4th O
was O
another O
mp4 O
( O
MPEG-4 O
( O
Divx4 O
simple@1 O
) O
and O
that O
would O
n't O
play O
at O
all O
- O
error O
message O
that O
it O
could O
n't O
play O
this O
type O
of O
video O
. O

4 O
stars O
because O
lately O
the O
shields O
have O
had O
lines O
on O
them O
from O
the O
factory O
. O

It O
kept O
it O
power O
for O
about O
2 O
or O
3 O
hrs O
. O

Now O
the O
hinges O
are O
new O
. O

Not O
much O
sence O
hooking O
up O
a O
laptop O
to O
a O
42 O
" O
screen O
if O
you O
can O
only O
watch O
it O
in O
small O
screen O
view O
. O

I O
've O
only O
had O
1 O
notebook O
previously O
( O
a O
4 O
year O
old O
Lenovo O
R61 O
) O
which O
had O
a O
Intel O
Wireless O
N O
Card O
. O

Great O
construction O
and O
the O
al O
buckles O
although O
a O
bit O
finicky O
( O
meaning O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
slot O
them O
, O
and O
may O
take O
a O
few O
attempts O
) O
but O

I O
always O
hardwire O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O

As O
expected O
, O
prices O
have O
come O
down O
on O
this O
model O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
newer O
models O
have O
come O
out O
with O
enriched O
features O
. O

But O
again O
, O
I O
am O
reasonable O
, O
I O
did O
not O
become O
upset O
. O

The O
high O
frequencies O
are O
much O
more O
present O
than O
in O
the O
Acer O
, O
and O
even O
though O
the O
speakers O
point O
to O
the O
bottom O
, O
the O
sound O
feels O
like O
its O
radiating O
up O
through O
the O
keyboard O
like O
the O
HP O
11 O
. O

Worse O
yet O
, O
when O
I O
plugged O
my O
iphone4 O
to O
it O
, O
the O
iPhone O
started O
charging O
but O
it O
also O
started O
behaving O
oddly O
, O
not O
recognizing O
touches O
, O
etc O
. O

Works O
real O
well O
for O
all O
my O
devices O
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
bin O
that O
holds O
your O
device O
is O
large O
enough O
for O
any O
iPod O
, O
and O
even O
a O
cell O
phone O
and O
the O
hard O
case O
offers O
added O
protection O
, O
while O
keeping O
everything O
tidy O
. O

No O
problems O
or O
complaints O
on O
any O
purchase O
. O

Works O
just O
like O
it O
should O
, O
does O
n't O
' O
cut O
out O
' O
and O
fits O
my O
hand O
perfectly O
. O

TLDR O
verson O
: O

The O
build O
is O
better O
than O
the O
Bose O
, O
the O
aluminum O
handle O
makes O
it O
feel O
sturdy O
. O

Wow O
, O
this O
little O
speaker O
has O
great O
big O
stereo O
sound O
. O

In O
case O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
first O
reviews O
are O
reading O
, O
here O
are O
the O
many O
positive O
aspects O
of O
the O
bag:1 O
) O

I O
can O
control O
music O
( O
forward O
, O
reverse O
, O
and O
pause O
) O
playing O
from O
your O
iPhone O
( O
and O
probably O
most O
other O
BT O
- O
connected O
devices O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
tested O
them O
all O
) O
from O
the O
speaker.- O

I O
am O
a O
PC O
fanatic O
and O
grabbed O
this O
deal O
. O

If O
I O
need O
a O
similar O
item O
, O
will O
purchase O
from O
& O
# O
34;sunvalleytek&#34 O
; O
again O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
who O
has O
purchased O
many O
higher O
priced O
bags O
was O
very O
impressed O
with O
this O
one O
as O
well O
. O

When O
my O
children O
were O
little O
, O
I O
labeled O
everything O
in O
the O
house O
because O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
help O
them O
to O
learn O
to O
read O
faster O
making O
the O
connection O
between O
the O
word O
television O
on O
the O
tv O
and O
the O
television O
itself O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
heat O
up O
much O
, O
you O
can O
use O
it O
on O
your O
lap O
the O
whole O
day O
. O

Since O
I O
purchased O
this O
DVI O
- O
to O
- O
HDMI O
cable O
everything O
is O
in O
perfect O
720p O
aspect O
and O
all O
the O
colors O
appear O
accurate O
and O
vibrant O
. O

After O
looking O
around O
for O
SDHC O
cards O
in O
several O
retail O
stores O
, O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
card O
, O
brought O
it O
to O
be O
used O
for O
my O
Canon O
DSLR O
and O
Canon O
camcorder O
. O

Ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
durability O
at O
this O
time O
. O

They O
're O
past O
notebooks O
were O
a O
bit O
clunky O
. O

I O
should O
have O
known O
that O
at O
this O
price O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
piece O
of O
junk O
. O

It O
allows O
for O
a O
nice O
, O
lightweight O
headset O
-- O
just O
plug O
green O
to O
green O
and O
pink O
to O
pink O
and O
you O
're O
all O
set O
! O

For O
the O
price O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
access O
to O
internals O
and O
easier O
repair O
. O

This O
works O
great O
for O
the O
Toshiba O
Thrive O
tablet O
. O

So O
, O
the O
NAS O
is O
back O
online O
... O

The O
wheel O
is O
responsive O
but O
does O
not O
over O
rotate O
. O

She O
is O
very O
satisfied O
with O
both O
the O
memory O
card O
and O
the O
Camcorder O
. O

In O
order O
for O
the O
pad O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
intended O
the O
fans O
should O
blow O
the O
same O
way O
. O

It O
has O
one O
negative O
, O
the O
keyboard O
. O

i O
went O
from O
having O
the O
volume O
up O
to O
100 O
% O
to O
now O
down O
to O
25%.i O

Hub O
failed O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
something O
that O
would O
n't O
fail O
. O

The O
install O
of O
the O
operating O
system O
on O
the O
new O
hard O
drive O
was O
time O
consuming O
but O
not O
difficult O
. O

It O
arrived O
about O
5 O
days O
ahead O
of O
the O
original O
schedule O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
I O
hooked O
the O
cable O
into O
different O
HDMI O
ports O
and O
everything O
looked O
fine O
. O

I O
primarily O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
hackintosh O
as O
it O
's O
the O
most O
compatible O
bluetooth O
adapter O
to O
work O
right O
of O
the O
box O
and O
it O
did O
. O

A O
processor O
jump O
, O
HD O
camera O
( O
looks O
like O
crap O
) O
and O
thunderbolt O
. O

Dual O
Channel O
kit O
F3 O
- O
12800CL9D-8GBRL4 O
. O

As O
others O
have O
said O
, O
the O
plug O
end O
is O
straight O
, O
not O
bent O
at O
a O
90 O
degree O
like O
the O
picture O
shows O
, O
but O
that O
is O
n't O
a O
big O
deal O
imo O
. O

Thanks O
Amazon O
! O

I O
have O
to O
pack O
JUST O
the O
laptop O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
included O
wetting O
spray O
and O
squeegee O
I O
am O
convinced O
it O
can O
not O
be O
done O
properly O
. O

Works O
great O
on O
my O
Nexus O
4 O
, O
just O
as O
described O
. O

Great O
to O
have O
a O
handle O
as O
most O
sleeves O
do O
not O
have O
one O
. O

Does O
not O
support O
a O
grounded O
connection O
in O
Germany O
. O

As O
good O
as O
a O
real O
HD O
camera O
. O

The O
non O
- O
slip O
rubber O
grips O
on O
the O
Xpad O
hold O
the O
laptop O
well O
and O
seem O
to O
provide O
enough O
cooling O
for O
me O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
so O
go O
for O
it O
. O

While O
the O
Apple O
keyboard O
is O
beautiful O
, O
and O
the O
quality O
exceptional O
, O
this O
Anker O
keyboard O
is O
every O
bit O
as O
functional O
and O
light O
, O
and O
is O
perfect O
for O
use O
with O
both O
mobile O
devices O
as O
well O
as O
any O
computer O
that O
supports O
Bluetooth O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
really O
a O
& O
# O
34;touch O
screen&#34 O
; O
it O
is O
lit O
up O
sensitive O
buttons O
. O

Now O
if O
cash O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
you O
, O
then O
just O
go O
experience O
Windows O
8 O
and O
Mountain O
Lion O
OS O
, O
as O
you O
just O
need O
to O
know O
which O
ones O
fits O
you O
better O
. O

I O
knew O
they O
weregoing O
to O
always O
be O
around O
no O
matter O
what O
took O
place O
. O

I O
am O
very O
glad O
we O
order O
this O
adapter O
, O
and O
definitely O
order O
from O
these O
folks O
again O
! O

I O
filled O
one O
of O
the O
16 O
gb O
cards O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
started O
on O
the O
second O
. O

Put O
the O
CD O
in O
the O
drive O
and O
read O
everything O
in O
the O
set O
- O
up O
instructions O
carefully O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
with O
my O
Canon O
A20 O
and O
have O
n't O
looked O
back O
. O

I O
've O
had O
all O
three O
for O
many O
many O
years O
. O

Many O
were O
too O
small O
or O
too O
large O
. O

They O
lacked O
bass O
and O
treble O
and O
was O
a O
pain O
to O
listen O
to O
. O

It O
still O
works O
great O
under O
some O
heavy O
use O

And O
the O
prop O
- O
sized O
fan O
dissipates O
the O
heat O
from O
the O
laptop O
much O
better O
than O
the O
multi O
- O
fanned O
coolers O
that O
I O
've O
used O
before O
. O

I O
had O
one O
left O
. O

Wow O
- O
what O
a O
difference O
! O

Drawing O
in O
the O
Autodesk O
and O
Corel O
products O
also O
demonstrated O
the O
precision O
and O
control O
that O
the O
tablet O
provides O
. O

They O
should O
really O
not O
advertise O
it O
as O
such O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
and O
they O
'd O
probably O
have O
higher O
ratings O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
got O
this O
compact O
sidekick O
, O
because O
they O
let O
me O
use O
my O
computer O
with O
ease O
and O
pleasure O
. O

The O
original O
intent O
was O
to O
buy O
this O
for O
my O
android O
tablet O
.. O

For O
developers O
cranking O
out O
high O
CPU O
usage O
, O
I O
'd O
suggest O
it O
. O

USB O
1 O
. O
1 O
or O
USB O

The O
person O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
. O

The O
webcam O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
mic O
built O
next O
to O
the O
camera O
, O
which O
works O
better O
than O
my O
laptop O
mic O
and O
reduces O
ambient O
noise O
. O

This O
allows O
you O
to O
watch O
in O
high O
definition O
and O
record O
in O
whatever O
definition O
your O
recorder O
allows O
. O

+ O
$ O
475 O
asking O
price O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
the O
Surface O
2 O
needs O
this O
cover O
/ O
keyboard O
for O
protection O
and O
an O
always O
available O
keyboard O
. O

but O
it O
could O
possibly O
be O
due O
to O
the O
video O
itself O
( O
download O
/ O
streaming O
) O

Power O
adapters O
are O
often O
the O
first O
things O
to O
break O
with O
a O
laptop O
, O
either O
in O
the O
supply O
itself O
or O
at O
the O
connector O
. O

That O
's O
all O
the O
small O
stuff O
. O

] O
) O
You O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
:) O

and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
true O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
nit O
- O
pick O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
idea O
. O

There O
's O
got O
to O
be O
a O
reason O
for O
that O
. O

PLUS O
wonderful O
utilites O
like O
Word O
, O
Excel O
, O
and O
Microsoft O
Money O
. O

This O
basically O
crashed O
the O
machine O
and O
I O
had O
to O
look O
on O
line O
to O
find O
out O
how O
to O
completely O
reset O
the O
T100 O
to O
factory O
specs O
. O

The O
case O
works O
great O
and O
keeps O
my O
computer O
protected O
from O
the O
world O
. O

I O
paid O
45 O
bucks O
on O
these O
attractive O
speakers O
. O

There O
are O
pop O
- O
out O
plastic O
prongs O
to O
secure O
the O
adapter O
in O
UK O
- O
style O
plugs O
, O
and O
the O
normal O
plugs O
screw O
out O
to O
reach O
deep O
sockets O
, O
although O
in O
the O
latter O
case O
I O
've O
seen O
some O
sockets O
where O
the O
plugs O
extended O
too O
long O
and O
one O
had O
to O
half O
- O
insert O
the O
adapter O
to O
get O
current O
. O

Dumb O
HP O
batteries O
are O
junk O

It O
does O
n't O
however O
make O
it O
standard O
instead O
of O
wide O
screen O
. O

HP O
recognized O
the O
formatted O
drive O
with O
data O
instantly O
or O
you O
can O
just O
re O
- O
format O
. O

Only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
unit O
is O
somewhat O
slick O
and O
if O
it O
is O
not O
on O
a O
mouse O
pad O
that O
creates O
some O
resistant O
, O
it O
hits O
the O
floor O
. O

A O
frustration O
I O
had O
with O
this O
bag O
that O
might O
not O
affect O
you O
, O
was O
that O
the O
should O
strap O
is O
not O
attached O
upon O
arrival O
, O
and O
the O
metal O
rings O
that O
you O
are O
meant O
to O
clip O
it O
to O
are O
nicely O
concealed O
in O
a O
side O
pocket O
. O

Great O
computer O
but O
the O
one O
I O
order O
could O
not O
transfer O
file O

Processor O
, O
Ram O
, O
and O
HDD O
all O
upgradeable O
, O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
want O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
. O

Wish O
I O
had O
purchased O
a O
brighter O
color O
version O
. O

Photos O
are O
as O
good O
as O
taking O
to O
Costco O
( O
I O
think O
that O
is O
really O
good O
) O
. O

Stickers O
stick O
on O
and O
( O
so O
far O
) O
have O
n't O
peeled O
or O
faded O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
simple O
item O
which O

the O

I O
took O
so O
long O

I O

Yeah O
, O
great O
value O
and O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
between O
my O
DP O
, O
Yamaha O

and O
Mac O

. O

I O
initially O
thought O
the O
PSU O
was O
DOA O
. O

This O
chill O
pad O
is O
an O
exception O
. O

but O
it O
is O
too O
heavy O
and O
bulky O
for O
the O
flexibility O
this O
size O
machine O
offers O
. O

I O
originally O
bought O
the O

works O
great O
except O
when O
all O
the O
overhead O
compartments O
are O
full O
in O
an O
overbooked O
flight O
, O
which O
seemingly O
more O
common O
these O
days O
. O

The O
cooling O
effect O
is O
decent O
too O
but O
does O
n't O
cool O
my O
laptop O
as O
much O
I O
had O
hoped O
for O
. O

Gave O
it O
to O
college O
kids O
, O
appears O
to O
be O
well O
made O
and O
able O
to O
take O
couple O
of O
years O
of O
abuse O
without O
much O
problems O

you O

you O

it O
works O
fine O
. O

Compared O
to O
others O
who O
sell O
this O
battery O
the O
price O
was O
right O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
latest O

for O
the O

( O

has O
this O

If O

are O

it O
will O
even O

This O
is O
intended O
to O
be O
a O

backpack O

so O
she O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
anything O

Since O
my O
Dell O

is O
not O
round O

has O
an O
octagonal O
shape O
I O
was O
worried O
that O
none O
of O

would O
fit O

I O
could O
go O

sometimes O
you O

comparing O

the O
beast O

It O

up O

that O
instead O

to O
not O

the O

who O
had O
put O

into O
their O

I O
should O
start O
this O

with O
a O
warning O
. O

It O
's O
about O
8 O
- O
10x O
faster O
than O

connection O
, O
but O
this O
can O
also O
take O
up O
to O
40 O
% O
of O

usage O
. O

and O
then O
they O
raised O
the O
price O
to O
$ O
598 O
. O

My O
experience O
with O
the O
iMac O

convinced O
me O
to O
dump O
my O
nearly O
new O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
M65-S821 O
for O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
device O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
product O
, O
and O
this O
seller O
. O

Press O
the O
power O
button O
and O
it O
is O
on O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
other O
perks O
, O
like O
a O
fingerprint O
reader O
, O
and O
I O
always O
love O
HP O
's O
decision O
to O
have O
backlit O
icons O
next O
to O
the O
keyboard O
showing O
you O
which O
options O
are O
activated O
, O
such O
as O
caps O
lock O
, O
wifi O
, O
and O
speaker O
controls O
. O

There O
are O
signs O
of O
over O
gluing O
around O
the O
pencil O
holder O
. O

The O
good O
is O
that O
you O
no O
longer O
have O
a O
cap O
to O
lose O
( O
never O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
anyway O
) O
. O

Then O
by O
opening O
its O
enclosure O
just O
retired O
the O
damaged O
disk O
and O
cleaned O
all O
the O
tiny O
broken O
glass O
spread O
inside O
. O

I O
'm O
totally O
fine O
with O
this O
and O
have O
nt O
had O
any O
trouble O

my O
macbook O
air O
around O

hand O

It O
would O
still O

up O
and O
the O

would O
appear O
to O
load O
the O
proper O

, O
but O
the O
gameboard O
just O
would O
n't O
do O
what O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
. O

I O
also O
have O
a O
very O
good O
receiver O
with O
large O
Klipsch O
speakers O
but O
never O
use O
them O
. O

Use O
them O

that O
is O

Some O
one O
wrote O
an O
earlier O
negative O
review O
about O
the O
plastic O

on O
the O

you O

the O

you O

Unit O
stopped O
working O
. O

The O
picture O
looks O
great O
on O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
gave O
4 O
stars O
because O
the O
screen O
resolution O
is O
pretty O
bad O
when O
compared O
to O
most O
other O
computers O
. O

but O
so O
far O
everything O
seems O
fine O

The O
smaller O
handle O
on O
top O
gives O
you O
the O
added O
choice O
of O
carrying O
the O
case O
by O
hand O
. O

Which O
is O
a O
great O
price O
for O
a O
32 O

LCD O
. O

The O
camera O
arrived O
well O
packaged O
, O
but O
the O
lens O
blind O
was O
stuck O
in O
the O
up O
position O
making O
it O
inoperable O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
can O
listen O
to O
just O
about O
anything O
and O
hear O
it O
clearly O
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
see O
them O
though O
: O
The O
Klipsch O
have O
the O
best O
bass O
response O
of O
the O

, O
but O
the O
mids O
were O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
highs O
were O
flat O
, O
sometimes O
the O
highs O
even O
seemed O
non O

for O
a O
little O
while O
now O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
holding O
up O
just O
fine O
. O

There O
are O
no O
handles O
just O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
, O
but O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
the O

can O

it O

I O
tried O

it O
seems O
to O
get O

does O

You O
can O
clone O

The O
Samsung O
also O
does O
not O
come O

, O
so O
you O
pay O
more O
for O
much O
less O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
one O
more O
small O
complaint O
( O
which O
I O
have O
seen O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
the O
only O
one O
) O
is O
the O
keyboard O

off O

it O
does O

I O

seemed O
to O
estimate O
the O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
I O
really O
have O
noticed O
any O
drop O
off O
from O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
my O

. O

/disconnects O
fine O
, O
but O
as O
with O

at O

go O
to O
pairing O
stage O
. O

It O
looks O
exactly O
as O
pictured O
. O

it O
just O
feels O
too O
laggy O
and O
delayed O
. O

The O
colors O
popped O
. O

The O
major O
problem O
with O
this O
mouse O
is O
that O
it O
often O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
connect O
with O
bluetooth O
. O

While O
the O
plastic O
is O
solid O
and O
feels O
sturdy O
enough O
, O
it O
's O
very O
easily O
scratched O
, O
so O
it O
's O
best O
to O
purchase O
a O
sleeve O
or O
case O
of O
some O
sort O
to O
keep O
it O
safe O
whenever O
you O
're O
not O
using O
it O
. O

ConsFans O
are O
a O
little O
louder O
that O
I O
think O
they O
should O
be O
after O
reading O
a O
review O
that O
said O
they O
were O
very O
quiet O
, O
maybe O
a O
hard O
of O
hearing O
person O
wrote O
it O
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
more O
padding O
at O
the O
bottom O
ofthe O
bag O
where O
it O
sits O
on O
the O
lower O
back.- O

Ca O
n't O
complain O
much O
since O
10 O
bucks O
for O
a O
laptop O
sleeve O
with O
this O
material O
is O
great O
value O
! O

Looks O
like O
a O
day O
- O
timer O
when O
closed O
. O

It O
does O
not O
come O
with O
an O
iPad O
charger O
, O
mind O
you O
. O

Btw O
Apple O
charges O
129 O
$ O
for O
a O
replacement O
battery O
. O

Some O
video O
cards O
come O
with O
a O
HDMI O
to O
DVI O
dongle O
in O
the O
video O
card O
box O
. O

I O
bought O
one O
a O
few O
time O
ago O

Just O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
new O
Canon O
Xsi O
& O
2 O
lenses O
. O

I O
got O
this O
to O
replace O
the O
exhausted O
battery O
for O
my O
HP O
Pavillion O
G71 O
. O

Microsoft O
makes O
agood O
product O
. O

Fast O
shipping O

I O
love O
the O
the O
Tamrac O
Rally O
5 O
, O
it O
fits O
my O
60d O
with O
tamy O
18 O
- O
270 O
mounted O
, O
room O
for O
2 O
other O
lenses O
and O
other O
gear O
. O

you O
can O
rock O
it O
with O
anything O
... O

so O
it O
's O
in O
foreign O
language O
. O

but O
then O
we O
tried O
with O
other O
HDMI O
cable O
and O
yes O
, O
it O
worked O
, O
so O

No O
one O
wants O
to O
pay O
Apple O
's O
ridiculous O
price O
for O
a O
replacement O
battery O
, O
but O
I O
suggest O
you O
look O
elsewhere O
for O
an O
inexpensive O
alternative O
. O

Have O
been O
using O
this O
power O
supply O
daily O
for O
over O
2 O
months O
now O
and O
it O
has O
performed O
perfectly O
- O
just O
like O
the O
original O
that O
I O
also O
still O
use O
daily O
. O

I O
really O
love O
this O
product O
. O

By O
default O
, O
before O
blanking O
the O
screen O
or O
sleeping O
the O
Aspire O
One O
will O
run O
a O
fancy O
3-d O
Acer O
screen O
saver O
for O
a O
while O
, O
which O
takes O
significant O
power O
( O
the O
fan O
speeds O
up O
! O
) O

.. O
at O
least O
now O
I O
know O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
. O

This O
is O
a O
refinement O
to O
previous O
generations O
, O
and O
I O
would O
bet O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
last O
for O
this O
series O
of O
machined O
unibody O
anodized O
aluminum O
enclosures O
, O
as O
elegant O
and O
perfect O
as O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
. O

There O
are O
messages O
in O
a O
few O
places O
saying O
, O
" O
This O
feature O
will O
be O
added O
/ O
updated O
soon O
" O
with O
an O
upcoming O
firmware O
version O
. O

Automatically O
shuts O
itself O
off O
after O
5 O
minutes O
of O
non O
- O
use O
. O

I O
just O
got O
this O
through O
the O
mail O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

If O
you O
only O
have O
a O
cd O
player O
with O
no O
inputs O

Mediabridge O
and O
Amazon O
.... O

but O
it O
has O
gotten O
way O
less O
over O
the O
couple O
of O
weeks O
that O
I O
've O
had O
it O
. O

It O
's O
built O
out O
of O
heavy O
sheet O
metal O
. O

I O
will O
then O
have O
to O
pair O
it O
with O
my O
iPad O
again O
to O
resume O
using O
it O
with O
the O
iPad O
. O

The O
battery O
itself O
holds O
a O
charge O
wonderfully O
and O
fits O
in O
the O
laptop O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
got O
this O
computer O
thinking O
that O
it O
would O
at O
least O
be O
fast O
enough O
. O

The O
Havit O
offers O
up O
the O
old O
- O
time O
simplicity O
that O
many O
people O
will O
love O
. O

The O
Notepal O
stand O
is O
cleverly O
designed O
for O
taking O
along O
when O
you O
leave O
home O
. O

This O
quality O
is O
like O
a O
European O
import O
, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
talking O
Yugo O
; O
maybe O
I O
should O
say O
German O
import O
. O

Just O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
product O
, O
and O
save O
yourself O
a O
headache O
! O

Playing O
some O
of O
my O
DVD O
and O
Bluray O
collection O
on O
the O
laptop O
looks O
amazing O
. O

I O
guess O
this O
could O
mean O
that O
there O
is O
a O
Mac O
compatibility O
issue O
. O

Apparently O
when O
tied O
to O
the O
Mac O
via O
HDMI O
you O
are O
limited O
on O
what O
you O
can O
change O
in O
the O
set O
- O
up O
. O

Blah O
blah O
blah O
. O

My O
average O
review O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
do O
nothave O
that O
much O
experience O
on O
this O
HD O
camcorder O
. O

It O
works O
, O
but O
as O
others O
have O
mentioned O
prolonged O
usage O
heats O
it O
to O
the O
point O
of O
diminishing O
returns O
. O

The O
flap O
folds O
in O
just O
like O
an O
envelope O
would O
so O
if O
you O
need O
to O
charge O
from O
the O
left O
or O
access O
the O
" O
trap O
door O
ports O
" O
you O
can O
do O
so O
without O
removing O
the O
sleeve O
. O

but O
still O
it O
looks O
nice O
. O

For O
the O
$ O
22 O
this O
mouse O
costs O
( O
at O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
) O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
much O
better O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

I O
used O
the O
same O
instructions O
on O
my O
new O
Amazon O
Kindle O
and O
getting O
a O
week O
plus O
usage O
. O
... O

This O
is O
Samsung O
's O
8th O
Generation O
LCD O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
would O
really O
protect O
my O
camera O
when O
I O
travel O
but O
not O
be O
awkward O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

but O
I O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
at O
all O
with O
this O
one O
. O

Just O
needs O
a O
little O
more O
stiffness O
. O

This O
did O
not O
happen O
with O
this O
mouse O
. O

MB O
/ O
s.$ O
sudo O
dd O
if=/dev O
/ O
zero O
of=/mnt O
/ O
tests O
. O

so O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
out O
this O
RAM O
to O
see O
. O

Cable O
quality O
is O
good O
as O
are O
the O
connectors O
, O
the O
VGA O
slot O
had O
screw O
fastenings O
so O
you O
can O
just O
stick O
it O
onto O
a O
cable O
permanently O
if O
you O
wish O
for O
easy O
carrying O
. O

The O
keyboard O
dock O
is O
really O
usable O
, O
and O
I O
appreciated O
having O
it O
when O
I O
was O
typing O
longer O
emails O
and O
editing O
office O
documents O
. O

Fits O
snug O
as O
if O
it O
was O
meant O
for O
the O
AC O
adapter O
from O
the O
start O
. O

I O
covered O
mine O
with O
decals O
. O

, O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
a O
problem O
in O
weeks O
. O

The O
battery O
fit O
in O
our O
HP O
laptop O
. O

I O
would O
certainly O
get O
another O
square O
trade O
warranty O
for O
anything O
I O
get O
her O
... O

I O
was O
told O
that O
to O
experience O
the O
picture O
quality O
comparison O
with O
other O
TV O
's O
- O
go O
to O
your O
local O
favorite O
electronics O
store O
- O
walk O
in O
the O
TV O
section O
and O
look O
for O
the O
brightest O
TV O
, O
and O
it O
will O
always O
by O
a O
Samsung O
! O

And O
its O
design O
is O
perfect O
for O
my O
ipad O
and/or O
a O
small O
laptop O
, O
phone O
, O
travel O
pillow O
, O
wallet O
, O
tickets O
, O
etc O
... O
all O
things O
I O
want O
readily O
available O
in O
my O
carry O
on O
luggage O
, O
but O
still O
want O
to O
be O
safe O
and O
secure O
. O

This O
is O
a O
clever O
little O
gadget O
which O
works O
better O
than O
I O
had O
expected O
. O

I O
only O
use O
it O
when O
in O
public O
places O
. O

What O
's O
disappointing O
is O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
find O
anyone O
selling O
that O
cable O
right O
now O
. O

Her O
surprise O
wo O
n't O
happen O
this O
weekend O
. O

That O
product O
was O
TERRIBLE O
! O
! O
! O

Great O
for O
e O
- O
mail O
and O
internet O
browsing O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
an O
installation O
disc O
and O
a O
usb O
connected O
base O
that O
you O
can O
use O
if O
you O
want O
to O
place O
the O
adapter O
in O
a O
different O
spot.**Update O

And O
it O
looked O
the O
best O
too O
. O

The O
quality O
and O
sound O
are O
outstanding O
. O

I O
put O
these O
in O
a O
good O
size O
room O
and O
the O
sound O
is O
good O
even O
in O
the O
highes O
volume O
. O

When O
I O
pointed O
out O
that O
I O
had O
several O
e O
- O
mails O
from O
them O
stating O
that O
my O
warranty O
would O
not O
expire O
until O
Apr. O
30 O
and O
that O
the O
e O
- O
mail O
's O
could O
be O
used O
as O
evidence O
in O
court O
, O
they O
put O
me O
on O
hold O
until O
finally O
agreeing O
that O
they O
would O
honor O
the O
Apr. O
30 O
expiration O
date O
. O

Bought O
the O
type O
D O
adapters O
from O
same O
brand O
. O

No O
backlit O
keyboard O
! O

There O
is O
a O
problem O
where O
if O
I O
plug O
the O
printer O
into O
a O
different O
USB O
port O
, O
Windows O
7 O
will O
not O
' O
find O
' O
the O
printer O
and O
will O
add O
a O
' O
new O
' O
printer O
via O
plug O
' O
n O
play O
, O
so O
always O
use O
the O
same O
USB O
port O
. O

Also O
please O
note O
- O
very O
important O
- O
there O
are O
three O
spaces O
before O
the O
words O
' O
default O
' O
and O
the O
first O
' O
alternate O
' O
- O

After O
I O
installed O
Ubuntu O
on O
it O
, O
I O
was O
blown O
away O
. O

Well O
.... O
THIS O
THING O
REALLY O
IS O
TOO O
GOOD O

Those O
are O
the O
ones O
guaranteed O
to O
work O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

Another O
customer O
had O
this O
to O
say O
about O
their O
Brookstone O
purchase O
. O

For O
any O
Linux O
users O
who O
may O
be O
out O
there O
wanting O
to O

: O
The O
IdeaPad O
will O
come O
with O
4 O
partitions O
already O
installed O
( O
2 O
of O
them O
being O
Lenovo O
recovery O
partitions O
) O
. O

I O
use O
it O
with O
my O
Sansa O
Clip O
Zip O
. O

It O
will O
be O
nice O
if O
you O
can O
add O
a O
soft O
back O
light O
to O
enhance O
contrast O
and O
make O
your O
TV O
look O
better O
. O

The O
sound O
this O
nifty O
wireless O
speaker O
produces O
is O
amazing O
. O

This O
is O
a O
six O
month O
old O
computer O
folks O
and O
all O
I O
did O
was O
open O
it O
to O
use O
it O
and O
was O
confronted O
with O
the O
black O
blotch O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

The O
BIOS O
is O
locked O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
lightest O
15 O
" O
laptops O
on O
the O
market O
( O
barely O
over O
4 O

But O
when O
i O
started O

type O
the O

, O

, O
3 O
, O

would O
not O
type O
. O

I O
then O
removed O
and O
reinstalled O
the O
software O
from O
the O
supplied O
CD O
, O
and O
then O
the O
internet O
connection O
via O
my O
Linksys O

was O

My O
only O
complaint O
( O
and O
reason O
for O

out O
of O

) O
is O
the O

Great O
laptop O
sleeve O
and O

My O
micro O
- O
usb O
port O
is O
on O
the O
left O
side O
, O
and O
my O
charger O
is O
plugged O
in O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
but O
this O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
issue O
. O

and O
I O
watched O
the O
computer O
for O
two O
hours O
( O
this O
is O
what O
I O
want O
you O
to O
avoid O
) O
, O
so O
I O
happened O
to O
see O
the O
message O
at O
the O
end O
of O
disc O
one O
. O

Call O
me O
crazy O
, O
but O
if O
something O
's O
battery O
powered O
it O
should O
have O
something O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
the O
battery O
's O
doing O
. O

dead O
, O
dead O
, O
dead O
. O

After O
about O
four O
hours O
of O
trouble O
- O
shooting O
on O
his O
Windows O
7 O
laptop O
he O
finally O
got O
the O
adapter O
to O
continuously O
work O
; O
previously O
it O
would O
only O
work O
so O
long O
as O
its O
connection O
window O
was O
open O
. O

The O
font O
size O
is O
easily O
adjustable O
, O
but O
would O
require O
more O
scrolling O
. O

The O
item O
worked O
flawlessly O
with O
my O
2006 O
MacBook O
. O

However O
, O
the O
strap O
is O
broad O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
purchase O
that O
you O
would O
never O
regret O
-- O
the O
pockets O
( O
inside O
the O
case O
and O
outside O
) O
are O
just O
perfect O
so O
to O
say O
( O
but O
not O
entirely O
perfect O
) O
. O

But O
still O
, O
the O
backpack O
does O
its O
job O
with O
all O
my O
gear O
inside O

Bought O
this O
laptop O
for O
someone O
else O
, O
and O
if O
it O
was O
not O
pink O
I O
would O
keep O
it O
for O
myself O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
the O
number O
of O
ports O
as O
well O
as O
the O
two O
accessible O
top O
ports O
. O

Bought O
this O
recently O
to O
find O
out O
what O
info O
was O
on O
several O
hard O
drives O
. O

Upon O
coming O
home O
I O
plugged O
it O
into O
my O
iMac O
and O
effortlessly O
loaded O
clips O
onto O
iMovie O
. O

Overall O
it O
's O
an O
alright O
purchase O
, O
though O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
around O

20 O
with O
how O
old O
the O

model O
is O

The O
second O
time O
I O
traveled O
with O
the O
new O
battery O
, O
the O
netbook O
malfunctioned O
. O

Its O
way O
too O
big O
to O
use O
just O
for O
your O
tablet O
or O
as O
a O
brief O
case O
. O

Would O
highly O
recommend O
! O

Occasionally O
, O
the O
devices O
I O
connect O
to O
the O
unit O
loses O
power O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
push O
it O
back O
into O
the O
socket O

More O
adaptors O
than O

Battery O
is O

, O
holds O
a O
charge O
well O
and O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

Make O
no O
mistake O
about O
it O
, O
while O
it O
might O
be O
less O
powerful O
than O
other O
Mac O
notebooks O
, O
the O
11-inch O
Air O
is O
no O
net O
- O
book O
. O

This O
purchase O
was O
a O
worth O
I O
must O
say O
. O

1st O
I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
this O
converter O
uses O
the O
cyan O
and O
red O
colors O
( O
is O
more O
common O
and O
have O
less O
ghosting O
, O
tested O
) O
instead O
is O
blue O
and O
cyan O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
and O
has O
twice O
as O
much O
life O
as O
my O
stock O
battery O
! O

The O
cable O
length O
is O
better O
than O
what O
I O
had O
before O
. O

The O
product O
is O
high O
quality O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anything O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

This O
computer O
can O
handle O
anything O
you O
throw O
at O
it O
. O

Not O
too O
big O
, O
plenty O
of O
compartments O
, O
decent O
quality O
for O
high O
use O

So O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
go O
with O
me O
when O
I O
take O
it O
out O
. O

UPDATE O
AT O
THE O
END)(ORIGINAL O

Asus O
has O
sent O
out O
a O
survey O
, O
and O
part O
of O
it O
was O
about O
the O
gloss O
casing O
& O
fingerprint O
issue O
, O
so O
probably O
in O
a O
few O
more O
years O
when O
I O
shop O
for O
a O
new O
netbook O
, O
Asus O
will O
probably O
offer O
different O
cases O
. O

The O
headphone O
jack O
sounds O
good O
and O
video O
processing O
is O
speedy O
enough O
for O
glitch O
- O
free O
video O
production O
. O

I O
used O
this O
USB O
a O
couple O
times O
to O
transfer O
a O
big O
file O
between O
PCs O
but O
now O
when O
I O
plug O
the O
USB O
to O
my O
laptop O
, O
Windows O
always O
said O
that O
the O
USB O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
format O
, O
but O
when O
I O
try O
to O
format O
the O
drive O
a O
warning O
pops O
up O
and O
ca O
n't O
format O
the O
USB O
. O

I O
received O
my O
charger O
promptly O
. O

Why O
pay O
for O
what O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
? O

But O
still O
it O
's O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
find O
the O
drivers O
and O
install O
properly O
. O

You O
take O
one O
or O
two O
little O
screws O
out O
of O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
laptop O
that O
just O
hold O
a O
plastic O
cover O
in O
place O
. O

just O
half O
the O
price O
! O

But O
check O
your O
own O
computer O
so O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
returned O
the O
product O
because O
it O
's O
tight O
enough O
to O
hold O
and O
have O
n't O
seen O
any O
reason O
to O
go O
through O
the O
ordeal O
of O
shipping O
it O
back O
and O
waiting O
for O
the O
new O
one O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
subscription O
required O
a O
25 O
digit O
code O
and O
one O
time O
the O
MAILED O
me O
( O
snail O
mail O
! O
) O

Does O
n't O
lag O
... O
so O
far O
games O
like O
BTD5 O
, O
no O
problem O
. O

Next O
to O
my O
monitor O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
I O
can O
go O
past O
50 O
% O
without O
it O
being O
ridiculously O
loud O
, O
so O
they O
are O
more O
than O
enough O
for O
any O
user O
unless O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
power O
an O
auditorium O
. O

I O
repeated O
several O
times O
and O
still O
could O
not O
get O
the O
card O
to O
work O
in O
my O
Dell O
D600 O

It O
's O
a O
little O
pricey O
, O
but O
a O
tiny O
bit O
goes O
a O
long O
way O
. O

This O
new O
Toshiba O
is O
amazingly O
fast O
. O

Reading O
the O
tips O
others O
have O
posted O
helped O
. O

This O
is O
also O
annoying O
when O
using O
UNIX O
because O
the O
AMD O
drivers O
tend O
to O
be O
pretty O
crappy O
compared O
to O
the O
NVIDIA O
ones O
. O

No O
problems O
putting O
it O
to O
use O
with O
the O
Syba O
3 O
port O
PCI O
- O
e O
card O
. O

Touch O
screens O
= O
smudges O
. O

Otherwise O
the O
Macbook O
becomes O
an O
overpriced O
PC O
. O

I O
've O
purchased O
several O
Mediabridge O
products O
and O
have O
not O
been O
let O
down O
yet O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
price O
it O
's O
acceptable O
. O

I O
like O
the O
Apple O
's O
way O
of O
function O
keys O
, O
pretty O
easy O
to O
use O
and O
only O
contains O
what O
we O
exactly O
need O
. O

As O
Mactracker O
( O
.ca O
) O
states O
this O
MBP O
can O
take O
16 O
GB O
while O
Apple O
says O
it O
takes O
only O
8 O
GB O
. O

I O
went O
back O

Looks O
to O
be O
about O
25 O
% O
left O
. O

random O
flashing O
and O
sometimes O
completely O
unusable O
garbled O
display O
issues O
make O
it O
impossible O
to O
recommend O
anyone O
buys O
this O
until O
apple O
fixes O
whatever O
driver O
issues O
are O
affecting O
this O
. O

There O
's O
a O
tiny O
ring O
at O
one O
end O
of O
the O
lanyard O
for O
attaching O
the O
unit O
to O
a O
keyring O
. O

( O
and O
I O
buy O
a O
LOT O
of O
monitors).Even O

I O
'm O
a O
demanding O
, O
somewhat O
perfectionistic O
guy O
, O
and O
I O
find O
flicking O
around O
between O
different O
full O
- O
screen O
applications O
, O
Mission O
Control O
, O
and O
Launchpad O
, O
to O
be O
a O
joy O
. O

and O
I O
've O
listened O
to O
it O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
at O
work O
. O

Top O
customer O
support O
with O
pc O
's O
and O
pc O
products O
, O
is O
sketchy O
. O

If O
you O
are O
used O
to O
a O
more O
sprawling O
full O
- O
sized O
keyboard O
, O
then O
things O
are O
slightly O
more O
compact O
, O
but O
this O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

The O
smallest O
is O
big O
enough O
for O
my O
iPhone O
5 O
. O

We O
purchased O
this O
charger O
to O
replace O
one O
that O
blew O
in O
a O
lightening O
strike O
. O

i O
had O
it O
hidden O
behind O
my O
speakers O

- O
it O
took O
me O
a O
week O
to O
have O
that O
same O
epiphany O
on O
a O
recent O
international O
trip O
. O

I O
'm O
used O
to O
being O
able O
to O
double O
- O
tap O
for O
right O
- O
click O
, O
triple O
- O
tap O
for O
middle O
click O
, O
but O
that O
's O
been O
removed O
from O
the O
Synaptics O
software O
. O

Now O
, O
thanks O
to O
God O
, O
I O
could O
afford O
a O
MBP O
, O
but O
I O
love O
this O
laptop O
. O

works O
fine O
charges O
battery O
to O
laptop O
, O
just O
gets O
hot O
sometimes O
. O

Great O
to O
have O
a O
replacement O
battery O
for O
the O
laptop O
. O

Long O

Sorry O
, O
all O
engineers O
are O
currently O
busy O
assisting O
other O
customers O
. O

it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
of O
an O
issue O
at O
all O
. O

You O
can O
use O
it O
as O
a O
stand O
, O
which O
can O
be O
good O
for O
typing O

I O
usually O
carry O
2 O
camera O
's O
when O
I O
travel O
, O
and O
I O
used O
to O
have O
to O
carry O
2 O
smaller O
camera O
bags O
, O
plus O
my O
laptop O
bag O
, O
but O
no O
more O
. O

So O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
there O
are O
batteries O
out O
there O
that O
can O
hold O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
longer O
period O
of O
time O
( O
the O
factory O
battery O
on O
the O
dell O

I O
ended O
up O
buying O
a O
replacement O
. O

Size O
is O
good O
. O

I O
had O
a O
cross O
- O
country O
flight O

I O
attempted O
to O
remove O
the O
speaker O
cover O
to O
take O
a O
look O
, O
but O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
sealed O
. O

I O
have O
the O
body O
, O
three O
lenses O
, O
cleaning O
supplies O
, O
filters O
, O
flash O
, O
LED O
lights O
, O
blower O
, O
chargers O
, O
batteries O
and O
my O
laptop O

It O
's O
a O
laptop O
that O
seems O
to O
realize O
it O
's O
a O
laptop O
. O

Wish O
I O
had O
a O
way O
to O
attach O
it O
to O
my O
Kindle O
. O

I O
only O
opened O
it O
each O
time O
I O
had O
to O
write O
a O
receipt O
for O
my O
business O
, O
and O
each O
time O
it O
performed O
flawlessly O
. O

It O
keeps O
it O
looking O
sleek O
and O
sexy O
. O

The O
compartments O
are O
to O
narrow O
to O
accommodate O
it O
without O
looking O
stuffed O
or O
stress O

zippers O
. O

a O
neoprene O

and O
it O
fits O
the O
Macbook O
Air O
( O
and O
MB O

) O

I O
guess O
I O
was O
wrong O
? O

This O
keyboard O
is O
well O
done O
, O
the O
keys O
high O
enough O
to O
be O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
and O
flexible O
enough O
that O
a O
simple O
touch O
makes O
them O
work O
well O
. O

Oh O
yes O
, O
it O
also O
glows O
cool O
blue O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
view O
this O
TV O
in O
the O
full O
beauty O
of O
HD O
just O
yet O
( O
getting O
Dish O
Network O
very O
soon O
) O
. O

Not O
really O
sure O
why O
there O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
negative O
reviews O
on O
this O
product O
. O

Sturdy O
and O
appears O
well O
built O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
case O
of O
your O
laptop O
/ O
netbook O
may O
affect O
how O
it O
is O
retained O
by O
the O
cooling O
pad O
; O
the O
metal O
at O
the O
front O
of O
the O
unit O
is O
bent O
upwards O
to O
form O
a O
lip O
, O
but O
my O
laptop O
's O
case O
has O
a O
very O
streamlined O
curve O
to O
it O
at O
the O
front O
, O
giving O
the O
lip O
nothing O
to O
make O
contact O
with O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
for O
10 O
days O
not O
without O
any O
issues O
with O
this O
device O
. O

I O
had O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
then O
had O
to O
switch O
on O
, O
off O
the O
wifi O
switch O
in O
the O
settings O

The O
bright O
power O
light O
on O
the O
wall O
plug O
face O
immediately O
tells O
you O
whether O
the O
outlet O
is O
powered O
. O

/whatever O
and O
hit O
play O
to O
start O
the O
playback O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
I O
can O
not O
imagine O
you O
will O
find O
a O
better O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

Its O
very O
difficult O
to O
get O
it O
to O
project O
to O
a O
monitor O
through O
the O
thunderbolt O
. O

Light O
weight O
. O

super O
small O
- O
this O
thing O
is O
tiny O
, O
which O
coupled O
with O
the O
weight O
makes O
this O
an O
extremely O
portable O
notebook O
. O

Great O
investment O
. O

I O
've O
used O
a O
variety O
of O
electronics O
cleaners O
over O
the O
years O
, O
but O
many O
end O
up O
leaving O
streaks O
on O
the O
tv O
/ O
computer O
screen O
. O

But O
with O
that O
installed O
, O
I O
get O
samba O
sharing O
of O
the O
USB O
connected O
device O
. O

Holds O
Kindle O
securely O
by O
the O
corners O
. O

It O
is O
very O
nice O
as O
a O
single O
function O
device O
. O

and O
so O
my O
sattelite O
reception O
kept O
dropping O
off O
to O
0 O

I O
love O
the O
nice O
, O
crisp O
display O
. O

The O
service O
I O
consider O
suspect O
. O

At O
least O
then O
you O
know O
quality O
should O
be O
better O
. O

Be O
sure O
the O
SSD O
is O
a O
7 O
mm O
height O
drive O
such O
as O
a O
Samsung O
840 O
. O
2 O
. O

It O
depends O
on O
how O
advanced O
the O
hacker O
is O
and O
how O
important O
it O
is O
to O
obtain O
your O
data O
. O

Truly O
a O
win O
if O
you O
have O
a O
tight O
budget O
and O
want O
a O
27 O
inch O
monitor O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
looks O
great O
. O

It O
's O
been O
about O
two O
months O
and O
the O
fans O
are O
starting O
to O
show O
signs O
of O
bearing O
wear O
. O

Your O
time O
may O
vary O
depending O
on O
usage O
. O

Please O
reformat O

Also O
there O
is O
a O
button O
on O
top O
of O
it O
that O
activates O
Windows O
Messenger O
or O
something O
, O
I O
never O
have O
any O
need O
for O
that O

Says O
it O
goes O
up O
to O
10 O
- O
15 O
m O
which O
is O
about O
30 O
- O
50 O
feet O
, O
Maybe O
on O
a O
fresh O
battery O
. O

I O
always O
had O
this O
in O
mind O
but O
never O
got O
a O
chance O
to O
buy O
one O
. O

but O
at O
$ O
350 O
category O
you O
get O
more O
functionality O
for O
your O
money O
with O
a O
Windows O
8 O
touch O
notebooks O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
days O
, O
I O
noticed O
much O
to O
my O
surprise O
, O
the O
residual O
air O
bubbles O
dissolved O
and O
disappeared O
and O
the O
screen O
protector O
has O
totally O
adhered O
to O
the O
LCD O
screen O
with O
no O
air O
bubbles O
or O
flaws O
. O

They O
take O
off O
grease O
better O
than O
any O
other O
I O
have O
tried O
. O

Works O
like O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
, O
plug O
it O
in O
save O
data O
, O
retrive O
data O
. O

Instead O
of O
one O
being O
the O
" O
Power O
LED O
" O
and O
the O
other O
being O
an O
" O
Activity O
LED O
" O
they O
both O
blink O
when O
the O
drive O
is O
active O
and O
stay O
lit O
when O
the O
drive O
is O
turned O
on O
. O

Excellent O
quality O
and O
the O
pouch O
is O
indeed O
large O
enough O
to O
hold O
the O
power O
supply O
as O
well O
as O
a O
mouse O
. O

My O
motherboard O
only O
has O
two O
usb O
3 O
. O
0 O
ports O
, O
and O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
need O
of O
more O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
power O
supply O
and O
a O
good O
value O
for O
an O
80 O
+ O
unit O
. O

If O
you O
pack O
lightly O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
floppy O
fabric O
to O
deal O
with O
! O

Love O
the O
wide O
screen O

The O

Worked O

the O

has O
been O
good O
( O

Asian O
and O
European O
models O
have O
a O
Bluray O
/ O
DVD O
combo O
drive O
or O
a O
Bluray O
- O
RW O
drive O
. O

I O
am O
still O
using O
it O
after O
2 O
years O
of O
use O
. O

but O
, O
this O
cable O
will O
NOT O
allow O
you O
to O
put O
separate O
displays O
on O
2 O
different O
monitors O
( O
example O
. O

6 O
inch O
Macbook O
Air O
perfectly O
and O
has O
really O
nice O
padding O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
a O
rating O
I O
think O
it O
deserves O
after O
spending O
time O
with O
it O
. O

The O
weight O
is O
about O
4 O
pounds O
. O

so O
I O
have O
64 O
GB O
storage O

I O
Googled O
it O
and O
still O
did O
not O
get O
much O
info O

Now O
this O
is O
n't O
really O
iGo O
's O
fault O
, O
but O
it O
realy O
is O
.... O

the O
only O
negative O
thing O
i O
have O
to O
say O
about O
this O
is O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
. O

If O
you O
can O
use O
a O
USB O
" O
its O
BETTER O
! O

If O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
decide O
between O
this O
model O
and O
the O
a750 O
, O
go O
for O
this O
one O
. O

The O
ordering O
through O
one O
of O
Amanzon O
's O
sellers O
( O
Beach O
Camera O
) O
was O
as O
advertised O
and O
shipped O
as O
promised O
, O
well O
packed O

The O
color O
of O
the O
case O
itself O
is O
a O
little O
closer O
to O
a O
frosty O
peach O
than O
a O
frosty O
pink O
, O
but O
it O
's O
still O
very O
cute O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
charge O
pretty O
quickly O
. O

( O
Yes O
, O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
the O
cables O
that O
come O
with O
it O
to O
attach O
to O
this O
cable O
to O
connect O
that O
phono O
to O
my O
receiver O
's O
front O
aux O
jack O
, O
as O
well!)NOTE O
: O

This O
case O
provides O
great O
protection O
for O
a O
laptop O
in O
a O
damp O
or O
wet O
environment O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
charge O
it O
for O
a O
full O
day O
before O
using O
it O
, O
but O
otherwise O
this O
battery O
is O
a O
perfect O
match O
to O
the O
OEM O
Apple O
battery O
except O
the O
color O
is O
slightly O
( O
barely O
) O
different O
. O

In O
not O
time O
at O
all O
, O
the O
battery O
was O
installed O
, O
the O
laptop O
immediately O
booted O
and O
hubby O
sat O
in O
his O
chair O
with O
the O
laptop O
on O
his O
lap O
and O
surfed O
the O
net O
for O
almost O
five O
hours O
before O
needing O
a O
recharge O
. O

Keyboard O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
a O
full O
size O
PC O
type O
keyboard O
but O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I O
kept O
the O
product O
because O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
without O
my O
computer O
for O
a O
week O
while O
waiting O
for O
a O
replacement O
, O
and O
I O
figured O
for O
the O
price O
, O
it O
would O
do O
until O
I O
was O
able O
to O
purchase O
a O
better O
replacement O
. O

Without O
AC O
connected O
it O
lasts O
10 O
minutes O
. O

Now O
when O
I O
travel O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
my O
tablet O
computer O
charged O
and O
ready O
for O
action O
! O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
what O
Toshiba O
was O
thinking O
, O
but O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
helped O
. O

Difference O
is O
build O
quality O
. O

One O
quick O
word O
of O
warning O
: O
You O
've O
probably O
noticed O
but O
Asus O
has O
a O
confusing O
range O
of O
nearly O
identical O
laptops O
with O
different O
model O
names O
. O

4 O
layers O
of O
duct O
tape O
later O
, O
it O
was O
acceptable O
, O
but O
then O
i O
had O
to O
move O
... O

You O
really O
do O
not O
need O
a O
mouse O
and O
dragging O
on O
the O
screen O
is O
much O
easier O
than O
using O
a O
touchpad O
. O

Super O
cute O
, O
protective O
and O
portable O
! O
! O

Was O
hoping O
this O
could O
help O
minimize O
cable O
clutter O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

Depending O
on O
your O
OS O
, O
the O
card O
will O
either O
be O
recognized O
immediately O
or O
you O
may O
need O
to O
do O
some O
configuration O

I O
bought O
a O
number O
of O
micro O
- O
USB O
cables O
for O
my O
new O
phone O

For O
those O
that O
do O
n't O
now O
or O
get O
this O
PC O
( O
it O
will O
drive O
you O
crazy O
) O

It O
's O
an O
example O
of O
how O
some O
simple O
innovations O
can O
make O
your O
life O
easier O
. O

I O
play O
Civilization O
5 O
on O
my O
retina O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
after O
about O
20 O
minutes O
my O
processor O
starts O
bogging O
down O
because O
of O
the O
heat O
; O
with O
this O
$ O
6 O
fan O
, O
I O
have O
not O
been O
getting O
any O
heat O
issues O
at O
all O
( O
except O
once O
, O
where O
my O
laptop O
was O
charging O
while O
I O
was O
playing)!There O

There O
are O
a O
handful O
of O
reasons O
the O
ring O
is O
better:-Continuous O
scrolling O
instead O
of O
' O
tap O
- O
and O
- O
drag O
' O
repeatedly O
for O
things O
like O
zoom O
, O
scroll O
or O
size O
changes O
( O
e. O
g. O
, O

The O
laptop O
actually O
slides O
in O
to O
a O
padded O
pocket O
from O
the O
side O
, O
leaving O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
bag O
completely O
free O
for O
files O
and O
other O
stuff O
. O

Overall O
4 O
because O
the O
site O
did O
say O
that O
support O
is O
on O
the O
way O
and O
the O
only O
bugs O
I O
found O
on O
the O
device O
where O
on O
a O
beta O
firmware O
, O
when O
the O
release O
the O
firmware O
with O
official O
Nexus O
4 O
support O
, O
ill O
update O
this O
review O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
attempting O
to O
smooth O
the O
edges O
because O
it O
is O
rough O
enough O
to O
be O
annoying O
. O

Very O
easy O

MAN O
SOO O
FAST O

Replaced O
the O
lost O
original O
Samsung O
Series O
7 O
Slate O
charger O
with O
this O
one O
and O
it O
has O
performed O
quite O
well O
and O
the O
price O
was O
very O
good O
. O

One O
tip O
though O
, O
run O
a O
carabiner O
through O
the O
outside O
zippers O
to O
keep O
them O
from O
working O
down O
the O
side O
and O
dumping O
you O
gear O
. O

I O
could O
not O
use O
the O
old O
acer O
for O
more O
than O
a O
half O
hour O
but O
this O
machine O
can O
easily O
substitute O
for O
a O
larger O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
pretty O
secure O
. O

I O
however O
became O
a O
Warcraft O
fan O
since O
my O
son O
convinced O
me O
to O
open O
an O
account O
and O
go O
questing O
with O
him O
. O

Lots O
of O
pre O
- O
installed O
apps O
to O
delete O
. O

No O
oddball O
video O
port O
as O
you O
'd O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
on O
the O
Mac O

It O
can O
not O
play O
back O
720 O
or O
higher O
video O
. O

I O
've O
used O
it O
as O
my O
primary O
charger O
since O
day O
1 O
. O

and O
I O
would O
suggest O
being O
really O
gentle O
if O
you O
remove O
the O
batteryto O
avoid O
snapping O
something O
. O

It O
is O
a O
single O
drive O
NAS O

Two O
fingered O
taps O
are O
registered O
pretty O
well O
. O

But O
there O
's O
a O
removable O
sliding O
door O
on O
the O
bottom O
and O
it O
was O
folded O
up O
in O
there O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
regret O
getting O
it O
, O
which O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
about O
all O
computer O
I O
've O
had O
. O

The O
main O
advantage O
of O
this O
is O
the O
direction O
that O
the O
plugs O
are O
oriented O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
is O
the O
power O
supply O
cord O
from O
the O
adapter O
to O
the O
computer O
: O
it O
kinks O
easily O
and O
is O
very O
stiff O
, O
probably O
a O
solid O
wire O
and O
not O
braided O
- O
bound O
to O
eventually O
fail O
. O

I O
meant O
to O
post O
this O
sooner O
. O

The O
small O
size O
does O
n't O
take O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
room O
in O
my O
laptop O
bag O
or O
add O
a O
lot O
of O
weight O
, O
like O
a O
full O
- O
sized O
surge O
protector O
would O

I O
have O
found O
nothing O
to O
criticize O
on O
this O
entire O
device O
other O
than O
, O
the O
backspace O
button O
for O
some O
reason O
is O
labeled O
Delete O
instead O
of O
backspace O
. O

After O
two O
days O
of O
working O
with O
it O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
that O
I O
'm O
in O
love O
with O
it O
nor O
could O
I O
say O
that O
the O
concept O
of O
using O
a O
glorified O
browser O
and O
cloud O
services O
seems O
as O
preposterous O
as O
I O
had O
once O
imagined O
. O

So O
a O
Windows O
product O
was O
the O
only O
way O
to O
go O
. O

No O
cords O
, O
no O
noisey O
fans O
, O
an O
extra O
USB O
port O
, O
it O
is O
a O
perfect O
size O
for O
my O
17 O
" O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
cool O
! O

With O
due O
care O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
little O
speaker O
at O
a O
great O
price O
. O

The O
challenge O
here O
is O
that O
he O
has O
two O
TV O
's O
in O
his O
office O
and O
wants O
both O
connected O
even O
though O
most O
of O
the O
time O
he O
only O
uses O
one O
. O

The O
only O
issue O
I O
had O
was O
having O
to O
turn O
off O
legacy O
usb O
support O
in O
my O
BIOS O
, O
without O
that O
my O
system O
would O
n't O
boot O
with O
it O
hooked O
up O
. O

The O
entire O
keyboard O
area O
is O
black O
( O
both O
keys O
and O
background O
) O
. O

Following O
the O
TF O
were O
the O
Acer O
and O
Toshiba O
in O
that O
order O
. O

) O
lined O
MP3 O
player O
pocket O
. O

I O
was O
torn O
on O
this O
item O
as O
to O
whether O
I O
should O
give O
it O
a O
4 O
or O
5 O
star O
rating O
. O

70/pack O
of O
2 O
, O
and O
you O
can O
find O
cheaper O
ones O
too O

but O
I O
get O
to O
keep O
my O
caps O
. O

I O
use O
those O
in O
this O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
to O
replace O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
it O
and O
those O
will O
make O
the O
bluetooth O
speaker O
play O
for O
4 O
to O
5 O
hours O
. O

And O
even O
when O
in O
exact O
position O
you O
only O
get O
minimul O
coolingmy O
laptop O
fan O
still O
runs O
constant O
to O
cool O

so O
I O
settled O
on O
the O
Corsair O
RM O
850 O
. O

This O
product O
loses O
a O
star O
for O
including O
a O
poor O
cable O
. O

Paring O
is O
automatic O
. O

Yes O
it O
is O
glossy O
. O

The O
preset O
Entertainment O
settings O
for O
audio O
and O
video O
are O
also O
easy O
to O
use O
from O
the O
remote O
and O
good O
settings O
. O

i O
love O
this O
thing O
, O
my O
macbook O
gets O
very O
great O
protection O
, O
it O
's O
looks O
really O
good O
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
the O
apple O
light O
come O
on O
out O
of O
nowhere O
! O

The O
microfiber O
cloth O
cleaned O
much O
better O
and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
everything O
off O
my O
screen O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
a O
single O
partition O
. O

The O
unit O
was O
delivered O
quickly O
and O
works O
fine O
. O

The O
only O
part O
I O
disliked O
was O
that O
placing O
the O
laptop O
on O
the O
stand O
constantly O
makes O
a O
small O
" O
dent O
" O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
stabilizing O
legs O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

I O
've O
shopped O
around O
and O
tried O
out O
SOOOO O
many O
different O
stereo O
bluetooth O
devices O
. O

I O
've O
had O
no O
issue O
with O
the O
zipper O
, O
or O
with O
it O
scratching O
my O
Macbook O
Air O

Light O
gaming O
and O
able O
to O
hold O
multiple O
tabs O
without O
slowing O
down O
. O

It O
would O
n't O
be O
all O
that O
irritating O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
constant O
annoying O
sounds O
, O
except O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
LOUD O
. O

it O
also O
made O
my O
life O
easy O
transferring O
pictures O
from O
my O
mobile O
to O
desktop O
for O
backing O
up O
( O
no O
more O
cables O
) O
. O

The O
silver O
lining O
is O
that O
I O
refused O
to O
deal O
with O
Amazon O
on O
this O
comp O
and O
bought O
the O
computer O
cheaper O
from O
B&H O
; O
, O
and O
that O
's O
the O
computer O
discussed O
in O
the O
first O
paragraph O
. O

The O
only O
good O
thing O
about O
this O
filter O
is O
the O
anti O
- O
glare O
it O
provides O
for O
the O
user O
. O

This O
product O
works O
for O
that O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
Mac O
owners O
BEWARE O
. O

The O
asus O
site O
has O
completely O
inaccurate O
information O
on O
how O
to O
build O
a O
repair O
disk O
for O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
how O
to O
access O
its O
factory O
reset O
partition O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
as O
my O
second O
computer O
for O
traveling O
and O
working O
in O
the O
fields O
. O

He O
lived O
in O
a O
trailer O
type O
housing O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

It O
will O
work O
and O
hour O
or O
two O
, O
then O
makes O
the O
audible O
sounds O
of O
a O
USB O
device O
being O
" O
plugged O
in O
" O
the O
" O
Unplugged O
" O
and O
does O
this O
over O
and O
over O
and O
will O
not O
allow O
any O
connections O
? O
! O
? O
! O

I O
have O
one O
in O
each O
of O
my O
lens O
because O
I O
have O
lost O
way O
too O
many O
caps O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
another O
brand O
's O
now O
. O

Honestly O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
use O
it O
as O
much O
- O
the O
cloth O
and O
spray O
were O
good O
enough O
. O

the O
ventilation O
holes O
really O
help O
to O
keep O
my O
laptop O
cool O
. O

Got O
an O
iPearl O
case O
on O
advice O
from O
office O
mac O
guy O
. O

Always O
had O
to O
have O
it O
plugged O
in O
. O

I O
would O
have O
never O
purchased O
this O
one O
. O

Close O
the O
cover O

Of O
course O
they O
would O
n't O
, O
but O
they O
'd O
still O
cover O
your O
car O
. O
) O

There O
are O
currently O
no O
skins O
available O
for O
this O
size O
/ O
model O
. O

Also O
allows O
me O
to O
share O
data O
between O
the O
devices O
. O

I O
think O
the O
only O
question O
is O
how O
long O
will O
it O
last O
-- O
only O
time O
will O
tell O
. O

i O
was O
trying O
to O
cut O
down O
on O
lights O
while O
on O
laptop O
and O
family O
watching O
tv O

So O
in O

I O

use O

like O
I O
used O
to O
with O
my O

since O
I O
could O

that O
I O
liked O

The O

using O
sturdy O

I O

When O
I O
replaced O
my O
hard O
drive O
I O
purchased O
this O
case O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
durable O
. O

plus O
I O
had O
4 O
more O
show O
up O
with O
at O

2 O

Had O
that O
been O
the O
case O
I O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
own O
one O
. O

In O
addition O
Lenovo O
did O
n't O
load O
up O
the O
Z570 O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
bloatware O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

hope O
this O
helps O
. O

This O
unit O
is O
not O
worth O
anything O
. O

I O
initially O
updated O
iTunes O
and O
updated O
the O
operating O
system O
after O
placing O
my O
information O
to O
work O
wirelessly O
. O

It O
is O
Lightscribe O
and O
DL O
compatible O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
junior O
audiophile O
and O
this O
is O
my O
first O
tube O
amp O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
look O
and O
solid O
feel O
of O
this O
laptop O
and O
its O
performance O
. O

It O
took O
me O
a O
minute O
to O
figure O
out O
which O
way O
they O
were O
actually O
blowing O
... O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
significant O
changes O
in O
the O
temperature O
of O
my O
laptop O

We O
both O
love O
them O
, O
excellent O
sound O
for O
such O
a O
small O
system O
. O

Attempting O
to O
run O
Audacity O
on O
an O
actual O

results O
in O
an O
error O
message O
stating O
that O
Roozz O
is O
n't O
currently O
available O
for O
the O
platform O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
hub O
lasted O
2 O
months O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
wait O
to O
get O
this O
easy O
to O
use O
cute O
USB O
port O
splitter O
. O

Now O
i O
have O
a O
keyboard O
that O
works O
. O

For O
example O
, O
this O
vendor O
charges O
only O
half O
the O
price O
for O
the O
same O
item O
- O
although O
it O
is O
still O
expensive O
in O
the O
absolute O
sense O
. O

Does O
exactly O
what O
its O
supposed O
to O
. O

Plugged O
into O
my O
XM O
INNO O
I O
can O
use O
my O
stereo O
Bluetooth O
headset O
while O
biking O
. O

I O
just O
like O
to O
have O
the O
newest O
and O
the O
best O
. O

The O
Charger O
did O
not O
last O
more O
than O
a O
month O
before O
failing O
. O

My O
first O
impression O
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
its O
big O
size O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
good O
idea O
, O

It O
's O
too O
bad O
they O
quit O
making O
it O
. O

Powers O
everything O
I O
put O
in O
my O
computer O
with O
ease O
with O
ample O
room O
to O
spare O
for O
growth O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

Two O
of O
them O
are O
running O

cooled O

Used O
about O
half O
of O
the O
battery O
yesterday O
after O
charging O
the O
Anker O
up O
all O
the O
way O
, O
my O
Nexus O
7 O
was O
at O
around O
65 O
% O
of O
a O
battery O
charge O
and O
took O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
to O
charge O
up O
all O
the O
way O
with O
the O
Anker O
. O

Easy O
to O
set O
up O
. O

Anecdotal O

are O
much O
more O
useful O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
more O
bang O

I5 O
and O

You O
need O
to O
first O
install O
the O
latest O
PRO O
drivers O
for O
the O
Intel O
mini O
PCI O
card O
you O
installed O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
a O
flaw O
in O
the O
battery O
or O
if O
the O
battery O
just O
behaves O
differently O
than O
the O
meter O
in O
my O
computer O
is O
calibrated O
for O

With O
electric O
outlets O
at O
a O
premium O
near O
a O
computer O
center O
( O
at O
least O
with O
ours O
they O
are O
) O
that O
would O
need O
something O
like O
this O
port O
with O
its O
extra O
USB O
slots O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
matter O
how O
slim O
it O
was O
it O

An O
aside O
is O
that O
all O
tech O
websites O
have O
good O
instructions O
on O
conditioning O
laptop O
batteries O
. O

The O
multiple O
pockets O
make O
it O
easy O
to O
carry O
extra O
batteries O
and O
memory O
cards O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
bother O
using O
this O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
free O
for O
life.-Hard O
Drive O
is O

I O
bought O
this O
so O
my O
kids O
could O
watch O
movies O
on O
our O
1600 O
mile O
trip O
from O
Pennsylvania O
to O
Texas O
. O

Unfortunately O
DHL O
misplace O
my O
order O
and O
Amazon O
. O

because O
they O
offer O
you O
a O
free O
2 O
week O
return O
policy O
, O
no O
questions O
asked O
. O

The O
keyboardis O
very O
compact O

... O
it O
just O
would O
n't O
work O
on O
my O

I O
bought O
a O
general O
battery O
charger O
about O
8 O
months O
ago O
for O
100 O
+ O
dollars O
only O
to O
find O
out O
it O
charged O
by O
time O
. O

Sony O
did O
a O
great O
job O
with O
the O
design O
, O
looks O
and O
also O
the O
special O
" O
Web O
" O
button O
. O

The O
packing O
materials O
even O
state O
" O
no O
optical O
drive O
" O
. O

I O
first O
tried O
the O
Netgear O
Push2TV O
, O
it O
worked O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
with O
my O
Kindle O
, O
however O
the O
video O
quality O
was O
very O
poor O
. O

It O
still O
has O
an O
optical O
disk O
drive O
, O
making O
loading O
drivers O
and O
programs O
very O
convenient O
. O

Very O
quick O

If O
you O
are O
more O
concerned O
about O
general O
heat O
management O
for O
any O
laptop O
size O
, O
you O
may O
want O
to O
go O
with O
the O
Logitech O
anyway O
... O
just O
remember O
that O
there O
will O
be O
some O
awkward O
overhang O
. O

After O
spending O
four O
months O
trying O
to O
get O
Dell O
's O
tech O
support O
people O
to O
simply O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
Inspiron O
600 O
m O
has O
a O
problem O
with O
overheating O
while O
playing O
hi O
- O
end O
3-D O
graphics O
games O
, O
I O
took O
a O
gamble O
and O
bought O
the O
Targus O
PA248U O
Tornado O
Notebook O
Chill O
Pad O
. O

Each O
of O
these O
machines O
has O
a O
standard O
10/100 O
for O
regular O
network O
connectivity O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
the O
Anker O
is O
only O
capable O
of O
output O
the O
19v O
at O
3A O
max O
whereas O
my O
notebook O
requires O
18 O
. O

What O
swayed O
me O
over O
to O
the O
Asus O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
keyboard O
dock O
provided O
a O
space O
for O
extra O
storage O
and O
an O
extended O
battery O
, O
as O
well O
as O
two O
USB O
ports O
, O
and O
a O
Mini O
- O
HDMI O
port O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
item O
to O
have O
for O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
or O
just O
to O
upgrade O
your O
laptop O
or O
computer O
. O

I O
use O
them O
mostly O
for O
at O
my O
computer O
, O
but O
occasionally O
plug O
in O
my O
ipod O
for O
music O
in O
the O
kitchen O
area O
. O

The O
advantage O
that O
the O
SONY O
has O
is O
the O
awesome O
keyboard O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

I O
previously O
bought O
the O
cheap O
black O
standard O
cables O
. O

While O
not O
the O
most O
stylish O
bag O
, O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
and O
has O
a O
memory O
foam O
casing O
. O

She O
grabs O
the O
Beautiful O
Leather O
Brief O
case O
and O
any O
files O
she O
may O
need O
for O
her O
first O
session O
. O

It O
is O
full O
- O
featured O
Google O
Chrome O
, O
and O
it O
is O
fast O
and O
responsive O
. O

However O
, O
you O
have O
to O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
price O
point O
for O
this O
monitor O
. O

The O
quality O
and O
thought O
put O
in O
to O
this O
bag O
trump O
anything O
out O
there O
that O
can O
be O
double O
the O
price O
. O

You O
can O
hold O
it O
by O
a O
corner O
without O
fear O
. O

The O
next O
rep O
would O
simply O
say O
the O
last O
rep O
was O
wrong O
.... O

It O
's O
wireless O
connectivity O
- O
this O
item O
connects O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
devices O
without O
the O
use O
of O
cables O
. O

If O
you O
are O
expecting O
a O
high O
end O
battery O
, O
this O
is O
not O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
aluminum O
cover O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
glossy O
finish O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
bothered O
. O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
things O
I O
noted O
using O
this O
. O

but O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
will O
protect O
the O
gear O
from O
both O
shock O
damage O
and O
the O
elements O
. O

Its O
' O
very O
basic O
, O
but O
most O
people O
nowadays O
should O
know O
how O
to O
operate O
a O
computer O
from O
the O
box O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
bit O
down O
on O
Windows O
8 O
, O
especially O
on O
a O
non O
- O
touchscreen O
, O
but O
the O
daughter O
has O
no O
real O
issues O
using O
it O

A O
few O
minutes O
ago O
, O
I O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
trying O
to O
open O
an O
MS O
Word O
Doc O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
buy O
Netflix O
or O
Hulu O
Plus O
, O
They O
are O
far O
superior O
services O
. O

Whatever O
, O
the O
cable O
works O
good O
, O
buy O
it O

I O
bought O
this O
drive O
at O
Sam O
's O
Club O
about O
4 O
months O
ago O
and O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

The O
cover O
also O
can O
be O
used O
as O
an O
angled O
, O
raised O
stand O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
trust O
Dell O
, O
look O
for O
good O
deals O
on O
them O
and O
have O
always O
gotten O
my O
money O
's O
worth O
. O

because O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
35 O
you O
can O
get O
double O
the O
cores O
with O
an O
AMD O
Quadcore O
A6 O
- O
1450 O
, O
double O
the O
Ram O
at O
4 O

, O
bigger O

. O

When O
I O
bought O
my O
Macbook O
Pro O
at O
the O
Apple O
store O
late O
last O
year O
, O
they O
told O
me O
" O
8 O
GB O
is O
more O
than O
you O
'll O
ever O
need O
" O
... O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
bag O
for O
holding O
my O
equipment O
, O
which O
includes O
2 O
camera O
bodies O

Canon O

More O
recently O
, O
I O
called O
regarding O
the O
power O
- O
cord O
cracking O
where O
it O
attaches O
to O
the O
power O
- O
supply O
. O

I O
really O
like O
this O
cover O
and O
trust O
it O
to O
keep O
my O
keyboard O
safe O
and O
secure O
. O

My O
two O
other O
complaint O
are O
the O
touchpad O
and O
the O
anemic O
sound O
from O
the O
speakers O
. O

what O
will O
you O
invent O
next O
? O

I O
can O
get O
my O
netbook O
into O
its O
sleeve O
without O
removing O
the O

so O
the O
power O
jack O
( O
and O
the O

next O
to O
it O
) O
are O
pointing O
toward O

Well O
worth O
the O
money O
to O
get O
such O
a O
boost O
in O
laptop O
speed O
. O

And O
fast O
shipping O
for O
Alaska O
. O

The O
price O
is O
so O
cheap O
that O
I O
was O
skeptical O

The O
delivery O
was O
4 O
days O
later O
and O
that O
was O
awesome O
! O
! O
! O

so O
i O
could O
transfer O

I O
've O
yet O
to O

It O
does O
n't O
' O
invade O
' O
the O
limited O
amount O
of O
space O
within O
the O

I O
noticed O
that O
the O
TINY O
tabs O
that O
reach O
over O
the O
bottom O
part O
of O
the O
case O
to O
latch O
it O
onto O
the O
laptop O
are O
so O
small O
and O
fragile O
that O
one O
of O
the O

was O
breaking O
from O
just O
being O
on O
the O
laptop O
, O
not O
having O
ever O
been O
removed O

Instead O
, O
I O
save O

on O

I O
leave O
them O
around O
or O
lose O
them O

so O
I O
replaced O
it O
with O
another O
. O

product O
works O
as O
promised O
. O

He O
is O
happy O
with O
it O
so O
far O

I O
plugged O
it O
into O
to O
another O

The O

I O
thought O
about O

to O

, O
I O
do O

hold O

in O

repaired O

So O
had O
to O
get O
another O
card O

, O
I O
opted O
for O
this O

other O
than O
that O
there O
is O
an O
airflow O

which O
make O
me O
comfortable O
when O
use O
it O
as O
bag O
back O
. O

My O
one O
and O
only O
down O
note O
is O
that O
when O
the O
iPad O
with O
it O
's O
case O
is O
just O
a O
bit O
to O
wide O
for O
the O
attache O
. O

it O
were O
n't O
for O
the O
challenges O
to O
get O
this O
working O
with O
nvidia O
card O
, O
I O
'd O
probably O
rate O
it O
4 O
stars O
. O

I O
'll O
give O
the O
Lowepro O
350 O
to O
my O
brother O
or O
a O
friend O
who O
has O
a O
small O
camera O
system O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
the O
price O
was O
right O
and O
it O
had O
good O
reviews O
, O
but O
the O
thing O
is O
too O
small O
for O
a O
17 O
" O
laptop O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
another O
similar O
case O
to O
compare O
, O
but O
the O
photos O
on O
Amazon O
make O
them O
appear O
soft O
- O
sided O
whereas O
BobJ O
's O
case O
has O
a O
hard O
back O
. O

These O
speakers O
actually O
deliver O
LESS O
volume O
than O
I O
get O
from O
my O
internal O
speakers O
, O
when O
both O
are O
at O
full O
volume O
. O

I O
removed O
the O
battery O
and O
then O
reinserted O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
recall O
if O
I O
tested O
play O
/ O
pause O

HDMI O
is O
listed O
in O
the O
description O
. O

This O
adapter O
works O
great O
. O

This O
is O
a O
particularly O
heavy O
system O
and O
will O
make O
toting O
it O
around O
a O
chore O
. O

Just O
buy O
this O
backpack O
. O

That O
's O
the O
right O
price O
, O
so O
get O
it O
instead O
. O

This O
external O
hard O
drive O
is O
accompanied O
by O
an O
extremely O
short O
usb O
cable O
that O
is O
not O
useful O
. O

It O
must O
have O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
AND O
a O
handle O
to O
make O
carrying O
the O
bag O
easier O

So O
this O
affordable O
little O
cable O
is O
a O
suitable O
deterrent O
where O
you O
feel O
it O
's O
appropriate O
for O
the O
risk O
. O

It O
may O
be O
that O
this O
is O
just O
myself O
having O
gotten O
used O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
amp O

This O
mini O
keyboard O
is O
just O
fine O
for O
home O
theater O
PC O
use O
. O

With O
the O
' O
portable O
office O
' O
as O
its O
mindset O
, O
there O
is O
a O
tailor O
- O
made O
compartment O
for O
a O
laptop O
or O
tablet O
which O
is O
super O
convenient O
and O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
a O
laptop O
case O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
Inspiron O
Mini O
10 O
at O
Sam O
's O
Club O
for O
$ O
329 O
. O

Bought O
this O
card O
for O
use O
with O
BackTrack O
and O
it O
performs O
flawlessly O
with O
native O
injection O
support O
. O

So O
, O
while O
this O
card O
definitely O
works O
, O
works O
great O
, O
and O
is O
an O
amazing O
deal O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
quite O
the O
range O
of O
other O
cards O
. O

the O

You O
get O

it O
quickly O
. O

but O
as O
God O
as O
my O
witness O
the O
other O
one O
is O
great O
. O

But O
for O
anyone O
that O
has O
struggled O
with O
an O
XP O

Vista O
or O
( O
soon O
) O

Twist O
and O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
make O
any O
accommodations O
nor O
readjust O
like O
I O
do O
when O
I O
switch O
to O
my O
small O

I O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
that O
then O
I O
go O
to O

; O
that O
I O
stop O
because O
that O
is O
where O
the O

located O
. O

Further O
, O
the O

large O
enough O
to O
hook O
my O

on O

in O

Nonetheless O

there O
is O
no O

The O

Looks O
great O

This O
is O
a O
special O
pouch O
as O
it O
has O
an O
audio O
cable O
that O
plugs O
in O
to O
your O
player O
and O
the O
other O
end O
at O
one O
of O
the O
back O
straps O
for O
your O
earphone O
. O

I O
found O
that O
when O
this O
drive O
is O
connected O
via O
USB O
to O
my O
computer O
( O
a O
custom O
built O
computer O
with O
a O
DFI O
BloodIron O
P35-T2RL O
) O
and O
with O
the O
hard O
drive O
plugged O
in O
the O
computer O
refused O
to O
boot O
, O
freezing O
during O
the O
POST O
. O

Besides O
the O
price O
the O
main O
selling O
point O
for O
me O
was O
they O
open O
on O
the O
short O
end O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
general O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O

The O
charged O
battery O
was O
a O
perfect O
fit O
and O
allows O
almost O
four O
hours O
of O
usage O
. O

Wow O
, O
from O
the O
moment O
I O
saw O
the O
Android O
Honeycomb O
, O
I O
knew O
it O
would O
smash O
the O
iPad2 O
. O

I O
use O
this O
with O
my O
netbook O
. O

My O
MBA O
never O
got O
warm O
on O
my O
legs O
- O
ever O
. O

I O
should O
have O
ordered O
it O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

There O
is O
plenty O
of O
space O
on O
the O
large O
hard O
drive O
, O
enough O
and O
more O
for O
your O
large O
and O
numerous O
software O
applications O
. O

Just O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
, O
at O
a O
very O
good O
price O
. O

but O
once O
I O
listened O
to O
the O
sound O
emanating O
from O
it O
all O
that O
went O
away O
. O

Seems O
to O
be O
an O
exact O
replacement O
for O
my O
Lenovo O
G560 O
. O

Gigabyte O
hard O
drives O
started O
popping O
up O
in O
the O
late O
90 O
's O
, O
but O
they O
cost O
hundreds O
of O
dollars O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you O
can O
make O
your O
home O
completely O
wireless O
by O
installing O
a O
wireless O
router O
and O
wireless O
print O
servers O
. O

It O
's O
a O
solid O
device O
, O
but O
the O
overall O
value O
is O
n't O
as O
good O
for O
the O
price O
range O

I O
'm O
not O
an O
audiophile O
by O
any O
stretch O
, O
but O
even O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
the O
sound O
quality O
was O
all O
that O
special O
. O

Comes O
with O
a O
convenient O
padded O
case O
, O
smartly O
design O
so O
that O
you O
can O
open O
the O
front O
flap O
and O
use O
the O
speakers O
without O
having O
to O
remove O
the O
speakers O
from O
the O
case O
, O
and O
so O
that O
you O
can O
charge O
the O
speakers O
( O
or O
use O
them O
with O
the O
AC O
adapter O
) O
without O
removing O
the O
speakers O
from O
the O
case O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
since O
the O
drive O
is O
mostly O
silver O
- O
painted O
plastic O
, O
the O
paint O
will O
pretty O
much O
wear O
off O
in O
about O
6 O
months O
when O
you O
attach O
it O
to O
your O
keys O
, O
leaving O
a O
dull O
grey O
finish O
. O

I O
did O
charge O
it O
after O
a O
couple O
minutes O
of O
listening O
, O
because O
I O
had O
no O
clue O
how O
much O
of O
a O
charge O
it O
has O
. O

Works O
great O
for O
the O
price O
. O

But O
I O
want O
to O
focus O
on O
this O
netbook O
. O

I O
use O
gmail O
, O
google O
+ O
, O
and O
google O
docs O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
useful O
item O
to O
have O
on O
hand O
. O

6 O
" O
because O
the O
screen O
's O
height O
has O
been O
chopped O
off O
10 O
% O
( O
16:9 O
) O
. O

At O
the O
original O
retail O
price O
, O
however O
, O
I O
would O
never O
have O
bought O
it O
. O

I O
had O
to O
do O
was O
plug O
it O
in O
and O
tell O
Windows O
how O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
network O
. O

There O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
useful O
apps O
preloaded O
, O
such O
as O
the O
main O
offline O
apps O
you O
might O
want O
( O
Gmail O
offline O
is O
very O
nice O
) O
, O
and O
it O
automatically O
syncs O
up O
with O
your O
apps O
, O
bookmarks O
, O
and O
other O
content O
as O
ChromeOS O
is O
designed O
to O
do O
. O

Everyone O
I O
've O
talked O
to O
so O
far O
immediately O
complements O
the O
picture O
and O
sound O
quality O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
bag O
about O
7 O
months O
ago O
and O
have O
completely O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

Sound O
is O
crisp O
and O
clear O
, O
lack O
of O
base O
but O
understandable O
due O
to O
the O
size O
. O

This O
may O
not O
be O
the O
fault O
of O
the O
adapter O
itself O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
the O
option O
with O
a O
DisplayPort O
Mac O
to O
get O
a O
monitor O
which O
supports O
a O
native O
DisplayPort O
connection O
do O
it O
. O

This O
was O
recognized O
immediately O
and O
seems O
to O
work O
fine O
. O

The O
ports O
are O
pretty O
standard O
, O
offering O
DVI O
, O
( O

, O
the O

in O

and O
everything O
was O
included O

a O

Tested O
a O
few O
times O
and O
no O
errors O
what O
so O
ever O
. O

This O
is O
really O
fine O
case O
for O
my O
big O
Note O
. O

I O
set O
this O
NAS O
up O
in O
about O
30 O
minutes O
... O
opened O
the O
package O
, O
slid O
in O
the O

, O
ran O
the O

up O

and O

were O
formatted O
... O

Happy O
organizing O
and O
have O
a O
great O
day O
! O

The O
one O
aspect O
that O
kept O
me O
from O
giving O
it O
5 O
stars O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
case O
does O
not O
have O
any O
sort O
of O
neck O
/ O
shoulder O
strap O
. O

I O
remember O
reading O
one O
review O
specifying O
that O
Asus O
would O
fit O
, O

WarrantyCONS:-The O
padding O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O

seems O
a O
little O
light O
compared O

Read O
the O
reviews O
on O
the O
twist O
and O
when O
Staples O
came O
out O
with O
a O

I O
jumped O
on O

The O

inside O
the O

and O
not O
pointing O
in O
a O
good O

. O

I O
have O
been O
caught O
out O
in O
the O
rain O

and O
it O
does O
a O
good O
job O

and O
if O
it O
is O

you O
can O
use O

In O
direct O
comparison O
to O

the O

superior O

This O

However O
, O
the O

is O
the O

I O
ended O
up O

This O
is O
about O

as O
you O
can O

maybe O
I O
should O
write O

about O
this O
power O
supply O
and O
really O
get O
things O
in O

I O
like O
that O
it O

and O
then O
I O

comment O
on O
that O

It O
requires O
absolutely O
no O

I O
would O
suggest O

Great O
battery O

Great O
Price O
, O
works O
just O
as O
good O
as O
factory O

I O
've O
had O
this O
computer O
for O
about O
half O
a O
year O
now O

Utter O
" O
Hell O
" O
( O

getting O
my O
various O
different O
bluetooth O
earphones O
to O

was O
as O
easy O
as O
connecting O

Yes O
all O
that O
i O
needed O
, O
it O
works O
really O
good O
, O
i O
have O
no O
issues O
with O
it O
, O
the O
cables O
are O
of O
the O
right O
lenght O
for O
a O
mid O
tower O
, O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
're O
ok O
for O
a O
full O
tower O
, O
i O
've O
never O
had O
one O
full O
tower O
case O
, O
but O
it O
works O
great O
for O
me O
. O

For O
$ O
800 O
less O
than O
a O
Macbook O
Air O
you O
can O
get O
everything O
that O
it O
has O
( O
will O
Ubuntu O
installed O
) O
on O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
almost O
as O
beautiful O
as O
a O
Macbook O
AIr O
. O

and O
we O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
the O
product O
( O
or O
charging O
the O
laptop O
) O
. O

I O
emailed O
HDE O
through O
Amazon O
and O
immediately O
got O
a O
response O

The O
pockets O
are O
roomy O
and O
fit O
my O
77 O
mm O
's O
easily O
. O

The O
instructions O
were O
pretty O
straightforward O
and O
using O
the O
book O
that O
I O
also O
ordered O
I O
went O
through O
the O
beginner O
exercises O
easily O
. O

, O
the O
custom O
kernel O
is O
handling O
all O
this O
with O
no O
additional O
app O
required O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
software O
development O
I O
also O
use O
this O
machine O
to O
run O
Autodesk O
MAYA O
, O
& O
Adobe O
Creative O
Suite O
6 O
with O
Retina O
ready O
Photoshop O
& O
Illustrator O
. O

But O
these O
abnormalities O
are O
worth O
mentioning O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

and O
it O
falls O
back O
a O
half O
inch O
. O

All O
that O
being O
said O
, O
they O
do O
work O
, O
and O
are O
fully O
functional O
. O

I O
gave O
one O
to O
my O
son O
for O
his O
glasses O
. O

Though O
it O
has O
5ms O
response O
, O
it O
has O
the O
some O
technology O
( O
Probably O
the O
SPLENDID O
) O
that O
works O
better O
for O
animations O
than O
my O
FHD O
monitors O
of O
other O
manufacturers O
, O
both O
less O
than O
1 O
year O
old O
! O

The O
charging O
cable O
is O
Micro O
USB O
but O
is O
very O
short O
by O
laptop O
standards O
. O

WRONG O
BATTERY O
THIS O
WAS O
MY O
SECOND O
PURCHASE O
, O
OUT O
OF O
THREE O
, O
AND O
NONE O
OF O
THEM O
WORK O

Definitely O
saves O
time O
docking O
and O
undocking O
. O

Estimated O
run O
- O
time O
for O
the O
included O
six O
- O
cell O
battery O
is O
average O
, O
reports O
running O
from O
2 O
to O
slightly O
less O
than O
4 O
hours O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
radio O
when O
I O
lived O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
large O
hill O
and O
all O
of O
my O
existing O
radio O
's O
got O
poor O
reception O
. O

and O
now O
I O
have O
an O
additional O
way O
to O
connect O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
to O
wired O
ethernet O
. O

Because O
they O
're O
absolutely O
beautiful O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
a O
slow O
computer O
that O
can O
hold O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
then O
, O
this O
Toshiba O
Netbook O
is O
for O
you O
. O

so O
far O
so O
good O
no O
issues O
of O
the O
quality O

My O
idle O
temps O
are O
at O
23c O
. O

It O
gave O
approx O
3 O
. O
5 O
hours O
battery O
life O
to O
my O
wife O
's O
R61e O
Thinkpad O

There O
is O
no O

sure O
, O
I O
do O
prefer O
to O
run O
these O
on O
my O
iMac O
, O
and O
even O
my O
MacBook O
Air O
runs O
them O
better O
, O
but O
if O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
go O
, O
I O
see O
no O
reason O
why O
I O
should O
carry O
a O
bigger O
laptop O
( O
I O
know O
, O
the O
MacBook O
Air O
only O
weighs O
1 O
. O

There O
is O
one O
large O
zipper O
on O
the O
outside O
that O
has O
a O
pocket O
for O
a O
small O
notebook O
( O
definitely O
not O
for O
our O
larger O

and O
other O

The O
other O
option O
was O
to O
consider O
an O
hybrid O
hard O
disk O
but O
this O
memory O
is O
a O
lot O
cheaper O
. O

It O
is O
sleek O
and O
quiet O
. O

I O
'll O
update O
this O
in O
a O
few O
days O
if O
they O
do O
. O

This O
is O
really O
the O
original O
as O
they O
saying O
, O
I O
bought O
it O
one O
year O
ago O
and O
never O
has O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
charger O
. O

Completing O
this O
installation O
, O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
automatically O
record O

from O
my O
satellite O

and O
then O
play O
them O
back O
at O
a O
time O

it O
is O
convenient O
for O

to O
watch O

Great O

And O
do O
n't O
believe O
what O
they O
say O
... O
this O
computer O
is O
good O
for O
3 O
to O
4 O
hours O
of O
vigorous O
typing O
and O
light O
online O

even O
with O

installed O

on O
this O
netbook O
and O
refuse O
to O
use O
Windows O
7 O
for O
any O
lengthy O
period O
of O
time O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
travel O
mouse O
, O
and O
the O
bonus O
is O
it O
's O
smaller O

Also O
has O

no O

any O

this O
is O
another O

that O
also O
has O
plenty O

The O
sound O
is O
muffled O
and O
not O
crisp O
and O
the O
bass O
is O
overrated O
. O

Would O
buy O
again O
. O

It O
's O
cheap O
enough O
that O
you O
can O
just O
save O
it O
for O
family O
get O
- O
togethers O
on O
holidays O
and O
vacations O
. O

It O
fits O
nicely O
and O
can O
be O
removed O
with O
easy O

but O
ths O
one O
has O
worked O
, O
for O
two O
weeks O
with O
two O
road O
trips O
, O
no O
without O
a O
problem O
. O

i O
recorded O
temps O
for O
my O
laptop O
without O
any O
cooling O
device O
, O
and O
with O
the O
Xpad O
and O
there O
is O
virtually O
no O
difference O

The O
resolution O
is O
perfect O
for O
this O

and O
very O
good O
for O

It O
turns O
off O
when O
you O
unplug O

from O
your O
laptop O
and O
put O
it O
inside O
the O
mouse O
via O
a O

Worked O
fine O
for O

let O
you O

was O
helpful O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
truly O
beautiful O
laptop O
. O

Took O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
replace O
the O
cracked O
LCD O
screen O
on O
my O
Chromebook O
. O

I O
have O
now O
been O
using O
this O
laptop O
bag O
for O
seven O
months O
and O
it O
is O
holding O
up O
well O
. O

I O
have O
4 O
- O
5 O
other O
netbook O
cases O
and O
this O
one O
is O
significantly O
better O
than O
all O
of O
them O
, O
for O
a O
lower O
price O
( O
a O
word O
on O
pricing O
later O
) O
: O

Why O
are O
there O
two O
nearly O
identical O
MagSafe O
connectors O
for O
MacBook O
Airs O
? O

Plugged O
this O
in O
and O
used O
it O
for O
the O
fist O
time O
tonight O
. O

When O
I O
tried O
to O
start O
the O
laptop O
the O
next O
morning O
it O
would O
try O
to O
power O
on O
then O
shut O
down O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
laptop O
( O
with O
Windows O
7 O
) O
. O

This O
fits O
my O
hp O
pavilion O
dv4 O
perfectly O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
just O
the O
application O

But O
really O
, O
if O
you O
have O
an O
xbox O
or O
playstation O
, O
you O
owe O
it O
to O
yourself O
to O
play O
on O
a O
PC O
monitor O
with O
this O
. O

and O
I O
do O
it O
too O
because O
if O
the O
transformer O
tablet O
is O
the O
half O
good O
as O
this O
one O
, O
then O
definitely O
worth O
buy O
it O
. O

I O
searched O
around O
on O
Amazon O
for O
a O
product O
that O
I O
might O
be O
able O
to O
use O
to O
read O
his O
3 O
. O
5 O
inch O
IDE O
drive O
from O
my O
laptop O
. O

An O
Ipad O
2 O
with O
smart O
cover O
and O
hard O
back O
will O
fit O
sideways O
in O
front O
flap O
pocket O
and O
easily O
inside O
main O
pocket O
standing O
up O
or O
sideways O
. O

so O
one O
does O
not O
need O
to O
dump O
10 O
small O
items O
on O
a O
tray O
and O
then O
hope O
one O
can O
collect O
them O
after O
inspection O
before O
somebody O
laid O
their O
hands O
on O
them O
: O
-)The O

Mostly O
what O
you O
see O
are O
Iomega O
and O
Western O
Digital O
for O
some O
reason O
. O

The O
large O
fan O
runs O
silently O
but O
moves O
quite O
a O
good O
volume O
of O
air O
( O
you O
can O
check O
the O
specs O
if O
you O
care O
about O
numbers).Note O
that O
the O
USB O
plug O
provides O
a O
USB O
port O
, O
so O
you O
do O
n't O
lose O
one O
by O
using O
this O
. O

But O
the O
SSD O
is O
still O
small O
for O
my O
taste O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
little O
throw O
and O
go O
to O
take O
to O
a O
hotel O
that O
offers O
broadband O
in O
the O
room O
- O
Your O
laptop O
is O
unleashed O
! O

The O
Sony O
costs O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
and O
I O
felt O
the O
cost O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

So O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
want O
to O
hook O
up O
your O
computer O
your O
television O
and O
you O
have O
the O
connections O
go O
for O
it O
, O
but O
if O
you O
got O
an O
older O
TV O
I O
'd O
definitely O
go O
with O
a O
different O
type O
of O
cable O
or O
you O
'll O
just O
need O
to O
get O
adapters O
for O
this O

Anker O
contacted O
me O
about O
a O
recall O
of O
this O
product O
. O

but O
it O
was O
just O
in O
one O
of O
the O
pockets O
. O

What O
I O
did O
like O
was O
that O
it O
came O
with O
two O
styluses O
and O
two O
USB O
adapters O
, O
so O
I O
looked O
at O
it O
like O
I O
paid O
seven O
bucks O
for O
these O
four O
items O
( O
the O
only O
reason O
for O
the O
two O
- O
star O
rating O
instead O
of O
one O
) O
. O

When O
I O
removed O
the O
carrying O
laptop O
bag O
that O
department O
became O
big O
enough O
to O
fit O
my O
17&#34 O
; O
Samsung O
laptop O
. O

There O
is O
an O
AM O
antenna O
in O
the O
back O
that O
can O
be O
hung O
up O
or O
draped O
behind O
a O
nightstand O

I O

is O
at O
all O

I O
went O

at O

I O
found O
this O

I O
was O
able O

the O

: O
a O

these O

Its O
a O

and O
an O

. O

For O
the O
five O
bucks O
it O
cost O
me O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
justify O
the O
time O
to O
return O
it O
. O

The O
video O
quality O
on O
this O
camera O
is O
truly O
excellent O
, O
as O
many O
other O
reviewers O
have O
commented O
. O

After O
seeing O
the O
LED O
and O
the O
LCD O
Samsung O
together O
at O
the O
local O
store O
, O
I O
really O
could O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
in O
picture O
quality O
and O
the O
LCD O
is O
MUCH O
cheaper O
. O

I O
updated O
the O
BIOS O
, O
then O
replaced O
the O
RAM O
with O
two O
2 O
GB O
sticks O
of O
RAM O
( O
these O
worked O
for O
me O
: O

But O
from O
what O
I O
've O
seen O
and O
tested O
, O
the O
fixes O
do O
n't O
really O
change O
anything O
ultimately O
, O
since O
if O
I O
go O
to O
a O
test O

If O

The O
module O
runs O
just O
slightly O
warm O
but O
not O
hot O
when O
it O
is O
plugged O
in O
. O

It O
has O
great O
tone O
and O
though O
not O
' O
wall O
rattling O
BASS O
' O
, O
it O
causes O
many O
to O
look O
with O
surprise O
when O
they O
discover O
the O
source O
of O
the O
music O
on O
my O

Pros O
: O
small O
size O
, O
works O
well O
with O
Windows O

. O

So O
why O
the O
1 O
star O
review O
? O

I O
've O
tested O
it O
in O
two O
different O
laptops O
, O
and O
the O
results O
are O
the O
same O
... O

It O
installed O
easily O
and O
worked O
just O
fine O
for O
me O
until O
it O
came O
time O
to O
transfer O
some O
files O
over O
to O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
bought O
because O
some O
customers O
were O
able O
to O
use O
their O
kindle O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
- O
wo O
n't O
work O
even O
with O
an O
adapter O
. O

I O
am O
SO O
SO O
lucky O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
leave O
the O
house O
for O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
and O
that O
my O
Macbook O
is O
ok O
. O

and O
it O
's O
zippy O
unlike O
the O
older O
Atoms O
. O

I O
purchased O
it O
with O
promotional O
credit O
which O
is O
n't O
refundable O

The O
power O
adaptor O
is O
small O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
great O
for O
a O
little O
device O
. O

( O
How O
can O
you O
not O
? O
! O
) O
They O
want O
to O
know O
where O
I O
got O
my O
" O
bling O
" O
mouse O
. O

This O
is O
a O
touch O
sensitive O
button O
, O
located O
above O
the O
keyboard O
which O
changes O
the O
brightness O
of O
the O
screen O
as O
well O
as O
the O
audio O
mode O
based O
the O
program O
being O
used O
. O

I O
suspect O
I O
will O
be O
using O
these O
speakers O
much O
more O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
it O
works O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
wonderfully O
with O
my O
windows O
8 O
pc O
. O

Fits O
multiple O
drive O
thicknesses O
nicely O
, O
has O
a O
nice O
shape O
and O
feel O
to O
it O
. O

These O
two O
laptops O
replace O
two O
MicroExpress O
desktop O
towers O
that O
I O
've O
had O
for O
nearly O
a O
decade O
. O

In O
so O
you O
can O
connect O
two O
of O
these O
speakers O
together*It O
comes O
with O
a O
USB O
charging O
cable O
which O
also O
functions O
as O
an O
3 O
. O
5 O
mm O
Audio O
Out O
cable O
. O

I O
know O
what O
my O
password O
is O
and O

It O
looks O
and O
feels O
cheaper O
, O
and O
the O
key O
action O
is O
pretty O
" O
soft O
. O

Oh O
well O
. O

However O
, O
negatives O
aside O
, O
it O
is O
sturdy O
and O
the O
airflow O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
straps O
and O
harnesses O
. O

I O
's O
still O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
replace O
eyepiece O
for O
my O
Canon O
Rebel O
camera O
. O

While O
the O
product O
does O
cool O
the O
computer O
, O
the O
claim O
by O
company O
and O
others O
is O
that O
it O
is O
quit O
, O
wrong O
. O

Still O
waiting O
for O
unit O
to O
come O
back O
. O

Might O
have O
to O
heave O
a O
breath O
or O
two O
onto O
the O
glasses O

This O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
done O
quickly O
, O
just O
in O
the O
next O
month O
before O
the O
60 O
day O
warranty O
ran O
out O
. O

It O
's O
also O
a O
spacesaver O
if O
you O
like O
to O
have O
a O
tv O
in O
the O
kitchen O
as O
some O
models O
of O
this O
computer O
include O
a O
tv O
tuner O
and O
remote O
. O

This O
is O
as O
described O
, O
works O
great O
and O
would O
get O
it O
again O
! O

I O
tend O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
archived O
FM O
shows O
and O
they O
all O
use O
Flash O
. O

This O
carrying O
case O
holds O
my O
tablet O
( O
in O
its O
cover O
) O
conveniently O
as O
well O
as O
other O
items O
used O
with O
the O
tab O
. O

but O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
using O
this O
laptop O
for O
the O
newest O
games O
, O
as O
the O
graphics O
card O
is O
n't O
replaceable+ O
the O
laptop O
stays O
cool O
and O
is O
whisper O
- O
quiet O
at O
all O
times O
. O

This O
is O
one O
I O
wanted O
to O
love O
- O
nice O
compact O
design O
, O
padded O
... O

I O
have O
an O
operating O
system O
installed O
on O
it O
- O

I O
use O
this O
primary O
with O
GarageBand O
and O
Amplitube O
on O
the O
Mac O
and O
Amplitube O
on O
the O
iPhone O
. O

Blue O
tooth O
included O
( O
at O
least O
in O
this O
model O
) O
, O
and O
backlit O
keyboard O
. O

Its O
rare O
, O
but O
it O
still O
happens O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
handled O
one O
in O
the O
store O

Unless O
this O
unit O
lasts O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
( O
of O
which O
I O
will O
come O
back O
and O
make O
note O
of O
that O
) O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
Belkin O
is O
worth O
it O
at O
this O
time O
unfortunately O
... O

As O
others O
have O
mentioned O
, O
this O
covers O
the O
microphone O
ports O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
unit O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
device O
, O
that O
would O
likely O
work O
great O
for O
some O
needs O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
have O
seen O
a O
video O
about O
a O
guy O
who O
disassembles O
the O
keyboard O
and O
removes O
the O
metal O
plate O
there O
to O
reduce O
the O
weight O
by O
a O
huge O
amount O
. O

gb O
went O
to O
video O
memory O
) O
, O
configuration O
of O
bios O
not O
needed O
. O

( O
I O
tried O
it O
on O
1 O
, O
4 O
, O
and O
16Gb O
) O
and O
regardless O
of O
how O
many O
clips O
are O
already O
in O
it O
. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
to O
receive O
this O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
do O
n't O
buy O
this O
for O
your O
netbook O
. O

Overall O
it O
runs O
fast O
, O
cool O
, O
and O
without O
hiccups O
. O

Fully O
NONfunctional O

I O
tried O
it O
on O
3 O
of O
my O
laptops O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
value O
and O
you O
get O

I O
was O
charged O
full O
Monday O
, O
and O
after O
just O
getting O
out O
of O
class O
today O
( O
Friday O
) O

You O
'll O
need O
to O
do O
this O
for O
every O
song O
/ O
album O
you O
play O
that O
is O
a O
different O
sample O
rate O
from O
the O
previous O
one O
you O
've O
played O
. O

The O
small O
sections O
in O
the O
bag O
are O
very O
useful O
. O

Her O
grandma O
, O
mom O
, O
and O
I O
were O
amazed O
at O
the O
sound O
that O
came O
out O
of O
this O
little O
speaker O
. O

If O
the O
unit O
had O
a O
couple O
more O
buttons O
( O
e. O
g. O
, O
a O
Fn O
mode O
) O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
easier O
to O
control O
the O
menus O
. O

Those O
are O
all O
freeware O
but O
the O
commercial O
stuff O
are O
n't O
too O
expensive O
either O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Dell O
XPS O
13 O
ultrabook O
and O
this O
thing O
fits O
like O
a O
glove O
. O

NOT O
buying O
this O
thing O
at O
this O
price O
.. O
its O
bigger O
brother O
.. O

2 O
nights O
ago O
, O
I O
went O
in O
to O
my O
office O
and O
saw O
the O
on O
- O
screen O
message O
of O
a O
lost O
connection O
to O
the O
drives O
that O
were O
connected O
to O
this O
while O
I O
was O
off O
at O
work O
. O

Pros O
- O
looks O
sleek O
, O
keyboard O
has O
nice O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
fast O
, O
plenty O
of O
space O
, O
good O
internal O
speakers O
( O
others O
have O
reported O
crackling O
) O
, O
well O
priced O
, O
plenty O
of O
easily O
accessible O
ports O
, O
light O
weight O
, O
set O
up O
for O
dual O
monitors O
and O
tv O
reception O
. O

I O
love O
this O
case O
. O

Bought O
this O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
revive O
my O
parents O
fried O
hard O
drive O
. O

After O
finally O
moving O
on O
up O
in O
the O
totem O
pole O
and O
getting O
my O
office O
, O
first O
thing O
I O
tossed O
were O
my O
earbuds O
. O

So O
, O
Case O
Logic O
, O
well O
done O
, O
with O
just O
the O
suggestion O
of O
an O
elasticized O
material O
for O
the O
pockets O
made O
for O
smaller O
objects O
. O

All O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
plug O
it O
into O
your O
computer O
and O
it O
works O
! O
! O
! O

: O
On O
board O
Memory O
for O
Apps O
is O
only O
4 O
Gigs O
. O

With O
all O
of O
AZ O
7 O
. O
5 O
topo O
maps O
on O
my O
laptop O
, O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
nice O
addition O
to O
my O
off O
- O
road O
fun O
. O

The O
" O
manual O
installation O
" O
is O
not O
intuitive O
. O

I O
actually O
ordered O
this O
and O
another O
unit O
at O
the O
same O
time O
( O
iHome O
iDM8B O
Bluetooth O
Wireless O
Speaker O
... O
which O
DOES O
have O
SRS O
) O
to O
see O
which O
was O
better O
. O

while O
on O
a O
recent O
trip O
, O
a O
problem O
developed O
with O
the O
` O
e O
' O
key O
occasionally O
sticking O
which O
occurred O
with O
normal O
tying O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
after O
finding O
a O
solution O
to O
allowing O
me O
to O
power O
my O
tablet O
while O
using O
the O
USB O
port O
for O
devices O
. O

hope O
it O
lasts O
with O
all O
the O
complants O
out O
there O
. O

The O
rigid O
covers O
are O
flat O
and O
flexibly O
jointed O
, O
firm O
& O
pleasant O
in O
touch O
, O
textured O
& O
not O
slippery O
, O
thanks O
to O
a O
very O
durable O
and O
stain O
resistant O
thermal O
plastic O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

and O
a O
few O
Windows O
updates O
this O
machine O
was O
flying O
. O

This O
works O
very O
well O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
like O
this O
mouse O
very O
much O
. O

The O
track O
pad O
is O
too O
sensitive O
. O

USB O
External O
DVD O
Combo O
CD O
- O
RW O
Burner O
does O
the O
job O
but O
is O
not O
very O
fast O
and O
they O
sent O
the O
drivers O
for O
it O
on O
a O
CD O
, O

This O
is O
a O
good O
hard O
case O
for O
my O
macbook O
. O

I O
think O
it O
balances O
better O
and O
is O
more O
secure O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
it O
is O
more O
stable O
to O
carry O
. O

From O
the O
same O
spot O
in O
the O
house O
with O
this O
adapter O
my O
monitor O
reads O
82 O
. O

Ghz O
Intel O
Core O
2 O
Duo O
processor O
and O
4 O
GB O
RAM O

The O
iEraser O
is O
also O
manufactured O
in O
the O
USA O
and O
the O
company O
donates O
a O
portion O
of O
each O
unit O
sold O
to O
various O
charities O
which O
is O
highly O
commendable O
. O

Great O
portable O
speaker O
that O
puts O
out O
good O
sound O
and O
seems O
to O
hold O
a O
decent O
charge O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
try O
these O
on O
my O
projector O
lenses O
! O

I O
'm O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
a O
lot O
of O
pocket O
, O
good O
price O

With O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
sleeve O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
into O
my O
Ebags O
Firewall O
laptop O
case O
. O

There O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
turn O
- O
ability O
between O
the O
upper O
portion O
and O
the O
lower O
grip O
- O
ridged O
turning O
neck O
thingies O
at O
bottom O
. O

I O
received O
it O
on O
time O
, O
it O
was O
received O
as O
advertised O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
found O
the O
battery O
and O
it O
performed O
satisfactorily O
. O

I O
've O
searched O
through O
netbooks O
and O
ultraportable O
laptops O
and O
could O
n't O
decide O
until O
I O
discovered O
this O
hidden O
gem O
. O

The O
sound O
was O
great O
, O
and O
the O
bass O
was O
great O
, O
and O
they O
were O
marginally O
comfortable O
, O
but O
I O
treated O
these O
headphones O
really O
well O
and O

The O
USB O
power O
connector O
means O
the O
unit O
gets O
5v O
x O
500ma O

Bought O
a O
laptop O
cheap O
, O
only O
thing O
wrong O
was O
the O
screen O
. O

so O
I O
can O
use O
it O
in O
the O
rain O
... O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
you O
will O
lose O
MS O
Office O
Starter O
and O
computer O
documentation O
from O
HP O
as O
well O
. O

ENOUGH O
power O
for O
casual O
use O
... O

Couple O
of O
days O
later O
laptop O
said O
battery O
was O
run O
down O
( O
2 O
% O
) O
even O
though O
it O
had O
been O
on O
the O
charger O
. O

I O
adore O
my O
MacBook O
. O

The O
organizer O
itself O
, O
however O
, O
makes O
a O
very O
nice O
portable O
office O
for O
the O
car O
. O

Using O
my O
original O
ASUS O
AC O
cord O
the O
unit O
works O
. O

Do O
n't O
expect O
an O
HD O
experience O
with O
this O
product O
( O
some O
of O
that O
could O
be O
the O
video O
card O
in O
the O
laptop O
also O
) O

4 O
: O
When O
the O
case O
is O
open O
and O
the O
iPad O
is O
propped O
up O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
there O
was O
much O
impact O
protection O
. O

I O
love O
it O
, O
it O
fits O
! O

Its O
few O
pixels O
slower O
than O
other O
gaming O
mouses O
, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
not O
hard O
core O
gamer O
it O
wo O
nt O
be O
possible O
for O
you O
to O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

because O
it O
is O
extended O
life O
it O
has O
a O
projection O
which O
serves O
to O
hold O
laptop O
off O
the O
desk O
at O
the O
battery O
end O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
compact O
three O
piece O
set O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
option O
, O
as O
the O
bass O
extension O
unit O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
lots O
of O
places O
- O
lots O
of O
people O
will O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
on O
their O
desktop O
or O
an O
a O
shelf O
if O
they O
wish O
. O

The O
backpack O
has O
lots O
of O
great O
storage O
areas O
, O
with O
different O
sized O
pockets O
, O
slots O
, O
etc O
. O

Have O
to O
update O
drivers O
and O
firmware O
for O
it O
to O
really O
work O
. O

The O
touchpad O
has O
a O
slightly O
rough O
texture O
that O
I O
like O
because O
it O
is O
quite O
different O

of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
case O

When O
I O
press O
4 O
keys O
down O
, O
my O
Chromebook O
switches O
to O
Ubuntu O
and O
I O
am O
able O
to O
use O
this O
Chomebook O
as O
if O
it O
were O
are O
full O
fledged O
laptop O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
to O
use O
. O

I O
had O
set O
a O
price O
limit O
of O
about O
$ O
1000 O
. O

This O
weekend O
I O
received O
a O
new O
toy O
to O
play O
with O
... O

My O
cheap O
KINYO O
speakers O
sounded O
much O
better O
( O
and O
I O
am O
truly O
being O
honest!)(1 O

for O
some O
reason O
; O
the O
webpages O
load O
slower O
and O
IE O
locks O
up O
a O
lot O
. O

so O
I O
feel O
confident O
this O
one O
should O
last O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
product O
otherwise O
if O
it O
works O
on O
your O
equipment O
a O
steal O
for O
the O
price O
. O

These O
were O
the O
only O
advantages O
to O
this O
wire O
. O

My O
system O
is O
Windows O
7 O
Ultimate O
64 O
bit O
. O

It O
not O
only O
holds O
and O
protects O
the O
tablet O
but O
everything O
I O
need O
to O
take O
with O
me O
, O
like O
my O
phone O
and O
papers O
and O
notebooks O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
factory O
cable O
, O
but O
I O
've O
misplaced O
my O
original O
. O

Color O
is O
lighter O
in O
the O
picture O
provided O
but O
yup O
it O
's O
cute O

Nothing O
else O
to O
say O
about O
a O
usb O
cable O
. O

The O
function O
- O
F8 O
key O
made O
it O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
the O
extra O
monitor O
in O
about O
5 O
seconds O
. O

This O
is O
average O
per O
Apple O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
not O
the O
right O
one O
for O
you O
if O
you O
run O
processing O
intensive O
software O
though O
... O
such O
as O
video O
editing O
or O
gaming O
software O
. O

But O
if O
you O
think O
you O
will O
be O
sensitive O
to O
the O
small O
size O
then O
buyer O
beware O
: O
you O
've O
been O
warned O
. O

My O
main O
complaint O
about O
this O
sleeve O
has O
to O
do O
with O
its O
thickness O
and O
protection O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
to O
replace O
a O
no O
- O
name O
clone O
that O
burned O
out O
. O

That O
said O
, O
the O
device O
just O
stopped O
working O
a O
day O
ago O
, O
and O
provided O
for O
me O
nothing O
but O
a O
blinking O
power O
light O
along O
with O
a O
seizure O
for O
staring O
in O
disbelief O
for O
too O
long O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
quite O
good O
with O
snappy O
performance O
and O
the O
touch O
screen O
with O
good O
response O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
a O
new O
laptop O
that O
's O
a O
little O
smaller O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
buy O
this O
one O
again O
if O
given O
the O
opportunity O
. O

It O
's O
permanently O
attached O
and O
thick O
and O
ropey O
. O

Crucial O
offers O
a O
16 O
GB O
RAM O
kit O
that O
turns O
this O
into O
a O
usable O
laptop O
. O

It O
still O
looks O
brand O
new O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
keyboard O
frame O
was O
not O
fully O
locked O
in O
on O
one O
of O
the O
laptops O
when O
first O
opened O
; O
I O
had O
to O
click O
it O
into O
place O
. O

I O
was O
totally O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
XBOOM O
Capsule O
speaker O
. O

It O
charges O
fairly O
quickly O
with O
the O
supplied O
cord O
. O

This O
flaw O
has O
been O
in O
the O
Apple O
OS O
since O
the O
introduction O
of O
optical O
drives O
. O

This O
card O
reader O
is O
fast O
thanks O
to O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
, O
light O
and O
work O
with O
cards O
a O
good O
range O
of O
SD O

MMC O
, O

, O

HC O
. O

The O
airport O
extreme O
worked O
with O
my O
current O
802 O
. O

All O
of O
the O
cutouts O
line O
up O
well O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
Like O
: O
Magnetic O
Clips O
. O

Desktops O
are O
another O
story O
but O
still O
require O
an O
exc O
wifi O
adapter O
and O
router O
and O
to O
be O
directed O

Fortunately O
, O
my O
son O
has O
almost O
the O
same O
laptop O
so O
when O
his O
needs O
replacing O
I O
will O
definitely O
look O
to O
Anker O
when O
his O
battery O
dies O
. O

I O
like O
these O
tags O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
can O
print O
them O
in O
my O
laser O
printers O
( O
I O
use O
HP O
color O
and O
black O
and O
white O
printers O
) O
and O
these O
worked O
just O
fine O
in O
both O
. O

( O
5 O
) O
It O
has O
a O
sternum O
strap O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
bag O
more O
comfortable O
to O
carry O
and O
secures O
it O
so O
you O
can O
bend O
or O
lean O
over O
without O
the O
load O
shifting O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
choice O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
, O
inexpensive O
device O
for O
typing O
documents O
( O
via O
Google O
Drive O
or O
similar O
web O
based O
office O
suite O
) O
, O
browsing O
the O
web O
and O
using O
" O
web O
apps O
" O
. O

and O
so O
I O
took O
it O
out O
without O
regrets O
. O

Jambox O
is O
a O
toy O
in O
front O
of O
this O
. O

and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

it O
stopped O
working O
after O
a O
few O
days O
, O
my O
computer O
nor O
any O
other O
would O
recognize O
it O
after O
the O
first O
day O
, O
after O
I O
took O
it O
out O
and O
reinserted O
it O
the O
computer O
would O
not O
recognize O
it O
in O
the O
usb O
port O
, O
I O
tried O
it O
on O
multiple O
ports O
and O
different O
computer O
to O
no O
effect O

I O
bought O
a O
couple O
of O
high O
gain O
( O
+8dbi O
) O
antennae O
next O
and O
connected O
them O
, O
but O
still O
no O
improvement O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
problem O
with O
fingerprints O
. O

Laptop O
and O
everything O
else O
, O
charger O
, O
mouse O
, O
cables O
, O
& O
extra O
battery O
etc O
. O

Sometimes O
when O
you O
turn O
it O
on O
the O
computer O
will O
run O
but O
the O
screen O
will O
stay O
black O
. O

I O
was O
pretty O
surprised O
with O
how O
well O
this O
little O
mouse O
performs O
. O

Although O
many O
people O
let O
Windows O
Zero O
Configuration O
manage O
their O
card O
, O
the O
Ralink O
program O
is O
actually O
pretty O
classy O
, O
providing O
lots O
of O
interesting O
information O
about O
my O
own O
and O
my O
neighbors O
' O
networks O
, O
with O
nice O
graphics O
. O

Changed O
my O
review O
from O
5 O
stars O
to O
one O
star O
after O
I O
learned O
that O
this O
company O
will O
threaten O
to O
sue O
you O
if O
you O
leave O
them O
a O
negative O
review O
on O
Amazon O
! O

Still O
a O
good O
bargain O
, O
especially O
since O
you O
get O
three O
of O
them O
. O

Nothing O
within O
the O
United O
States O
, O
anyway O
. O

Window O
Xp O
runs O
even O
faster O
and O
stable O
on O
MBP O
than O
the O
PC O
. O

Best O
cloths O
ever O
! O

This O
allows O
two O
downstream O
ports O
to O
be O
directly O
connected."But O
if O
used O
as O
intended O
, O
this O
devices O
works O
nicely O
, O
especially O
if O
used O
for O
an O
SSD O
drive O
. O

At O
this O
point O
Windows O
will O
recognize O
and O
begin O
installing O
the O
drivers O
and O
software O
for O
the O
device O
. O

It O
fit O
well O
in O
the O
MacBook O

I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
most O
incredible O
and O
valuable O
power O
device O
you O
will O
ever O
find O
. O

This O
webcam O
is O
outstanding O
and O
is O
a O
must O
have O
for O
anyone O
doing O
streaming O
wether O
on O
a O
Mac O
or O
a O
PC O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
only O
minor O
issue O
was O
on O
skype O
, O
I O
could O
nt O
get O
my O
sound O
to O
kick O
on O
( O
on O
my O
new O
mac O
mini O
) O
and O
it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
figure O
out O
to O
manually O
change O
the O
microphone O
input O
in O
skype O
preferences O
. O

Works O
as O
advertised O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
speakers O
in O
either O
my O
laptop O
or O
cell O
phone O
. O

So O
when O
it O
arrived O
I O
was O
surprised O
that O
it O
actually O
worked O
. O

I O
just O
Checked O
, O
the O
item O
is O
listed O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
a O
HP O
MU09 O
battery O

Yea O
the O
color O
is O
off O
a O
bit O
. O

The O
antenna O
is O
very O
weak O
, O
and O
gets O
a O
puny O
signal O
compared O
to O
every O
other O
wifi O
device O
I O
own O
. O

It O
has O
a O
slight O
rubberized O
finish O

I O
think O
that O
is O
kind O
of O
a O
lie O
. O

( O
then O
I O
recommend O
checking O
out O
a O
default O
profile O
, O
see O
if O
it O
works O
for O
you O
, O
then O
switch O
over O
to O
playing O
your O
custom O
setup O
and O
see O
which O
is O
better O
) O

It O
helps O
keep O
my O
power O

HOPE O
IT O
WITHSTANDS O

My O
docking O
station O
was O
just O
delivered O
from O
AMZ O
. O

Would O
recommend O
for O
overseas O
visits O
. O

This O
has O
made O
my O
morning O
commute O
so O
easy O
. O

You O
can O
even O
configure O
it O
to O
charge O
another O
device O
with O
just O
the O
battery O
alone O
and O
the O
netbook O
turned O
off O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
used O
an O
external O
case O
like O
the O
one O
I O
have O
, O
as O
I O
just O
bought O
it O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
I O
was O
nearly O
ready O
to O
send O
it O
back O
. O

I O
TRIED O
THE O
NETGEAR O

The O
previous O
generation O
had O
serious O
problems O
( O
system O
repeatedly O
froze O
) O
. O

great O
speeds O
. O

The O
set O
up O
of O
this O
product O
is O
most O
cumbersome O

* O
No O
power O
or O
battery O
indicators O
! O

SATA O
and O
Molex O
cables O
are O
short O
for O
full O
towers O
or O
super O
towers O
. O

This O
bag O
could O
use O
better O
padding O
, O
permanent O
separation O
between O
the O
two O
main O
compartments O
besides O
a O
removable O
liner O
. O

Best O
screen O
for O
the O
money O
. O

The O
three O
fan O
version O
has O
an O
adjustable O
fan O

. O

Very O
high O
quality O
and O
looks O
great O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
Apple O
products O
that O
are O
aluminium O
. O

I O
went O
ahead O
and O
bought O
the O
charger O
, O
with O
the O
midset O
that O
& O
# O
34;If O
it O
did O
nt O
work O
, O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
choice O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
sturdy O
design O
that O
stays O
in O
place O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
a O
mini O
laptop O
that O
costs O
2 O
K O
is O
going O
to O
be O
better O
, O
but O
most O
people O
will O
find O
this O
works O
great O
for O
their O
uses O
. O

I O
can O
also O
carry O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
, O
USB O
flash O
drives O
and O
the O
charger O
in O
the O
larger O
outer O
pocket O
although O
the O
latter O
bulges O
and O
may O
cause O
wear O
issues O
long O
term O
. O

i O
m O
simply O
in O
love O
with O
it O

I O
always O
had O
to O
move O
my O
laptop O
to O
be O
close O
so O
the O
cable O
could O
reach O
and O
after O
finding O
this O
longer O
cable O
at O
a O
cheap O
price O
I O
can O
now O
keep O
my O
laptop O
where O
it O
is O
and O
the O
cable O
can O
stretch O
to O
me O
! O

I O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
believe O
that O
any O
speaker O
system O
does O
n't O
have O
this O
feature O
nowadays O
- O
who O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
hook O
up O
their O
mp3 O
player O
to O
their O
speakers O
? O

The O
led O
glows O
red O
while O
charging O
and O
is O
green O
once O
it O
is O
complete O
. O

But O
so O
far O
, O
it O
's O
acting O
like O
the O
original O
. O

It O
much O
better O
than O
my O
ultrabook O
in O
this O
regard O
in O
fact O
. O

I O
just O
plug O
he O
Ethernet O
right O
into O
this O
and O
plug O
it O
in O
the O
USB O
port O
. O

This O
is O
probably O
the O
biggest O
disappointment O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
I O
was O
never O
confident O
that O
this O
case O
would O
do O
all O
that O
much O
to O
protect O
my O
laptop O
if O
I O
dropped O
it O
. O

It O
is O
every O
bit O
as O
fast O
, O
reliable O
and O
high O
quality O
as O
FRiEQ O
brand O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
the O
delivered O
cable O
was O
faulty O
, O
but O
ended O
up O
to O
be O
a O
bad O
purchase O
for O
my O
cause O
. O

Similar O
process O
for O
the O
laptop O
, O
but O
just O
scanned O
for O
OTA O
ATSC O
channels O
using O
the O
included O
antenna O
. O

it O
drives O
me O
crazy O
! O

It O
literally O
falls O
apart O
, O
while O
running O
, O
you O
can O
get O
your O
finger O
caught O
in O
the O
fan O
blade O
as O
it O
is O
turning O
... O
all O
kinds O
of O
Mechanical O
errors O

this O
unit O
... O

The O
crossover O
monitor O
I O
returned O
is O

and O
has O
a O
gloss O
screen O
. O

I O
need O
to O
mention O
that O
although O
, O
I O
could O
SEE O
the O
SSD O
in O
the O
Device O
Manager O
, O
it O
does O
NOT O
show O
up O

It O
would O
probably O
work O
great O
for O
an O
xbox360 O
cooler O
or O
an O
14 O
inch O
laptop O
but O
my O
17inch O

just O
makes O
this O
thing O
disappear O
. O

Great O
service O

fast O

too O

and O
I O
may O
swap O
that O
out O
for O
the O
much O

Or O
that O
I O
have O
completely O
misunderstood O
how O
the O

works O
:-) O

Take O
that O
17 O

Anker O
obiviously O
has O
determined O
to O
produce O
high O
quality O
products O
at O
middle O
of O
the O
road O
prices O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
same O
macbook O
for O
over O
2 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
now O
and O
it O
still O
works O
like O
new O
. O

Perhaps O
my O
expectation O
was O
too O
high O
. O

The O
initial O
setup O
does O
n't O
give O
the O
security O
that O
it O
should O
and O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
manual O
about O
how O
to O
change O

So O
when O

The O
overall O
design O
is O
outstanding O
, O
however O
the O
execution O
is O
highly O
flawed O
. O

A O

a O

also O
works O
great O

Not O
really O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
Dell O
, O
boots O
up O
much O
faster O
. O

I O
read O
on O
Amazon O
that O
the O
gray O
model O
is O
more O
like O
silver O
, O
so O
I O
got O
red O
. O

This O
is O
actually O
my O
first O
wireless O
keyboard O

Also O
I O
noticed O
that O
sometimes O
the O
windows O
do O
not O
refresh O
properly O
and O
an O
image O
of O
the O

that O
I O
just O

In O

these O
are O
well O

well O

Works O
like O
expected O

Wasted O
some O

thing O

03/29/2013My O
B121 O
continues O
to O
boot O
up O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
it O
charges O
my O
tablet O
much O
faster O
and O
keeps O
it O
charged O
even O
during O
heavy O
use O
. O

I O
was O
using O
excel O
and O
word O
. O

If O
you O
need O
thin O
and O
light O
, O
this O
is O
not O
for O
you O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
come O
back O
and O
comment O
after O
I O
've O
received O
it O
. O

I O
think O
the O
power O
cord O
could O
stand O
to O
be O
at O
least O
twice O
as O
long O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
fortune O
on O
a O
docking O
port O
for O
your O
laptop O
and/or O
want O
your O
laptop O
monitor O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
reasonable O
height O
off O
you O
desk O
then O
you O
should O
be O
considering O
the O
Kensington O

Man O
, O
I O
LOVE O
this O
little O
speaker O
! O

I O
think O
no O
bigger O
than O
a O
7 O
" O
player O
would O
be O
best O
. O

So O
, O
i O
found O
this O
to O
be O
good O
and O
modest O
price O
alternative O
to O
the O
powered O
- O
hubs O
. O

Also O
the O
" O
Gearhead O
" O
brand O
is O
the O
same O
, O
for O
$ O
20 O
. O
00 O

It O
is O
very O
slow O
and O
laggy O
. O

I O
would O
also O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
especially O
for O
this O
price O
. O

Also O
great O
is O
that O
it O
has O
the O
Thunderbolt O
pass O
- O
through O
! O

You O
're O
better O
off O
with O
a O
mouse O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
needed O
the O
XP O
side O
of O
the O
hard O
drive O
, O
and O
I O
have O
Boot O
Camp O
which O
works O
well O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
add O
any O
bulk O
or O
thickness O
to O
the O
iPad O
which O
is O
what O
makes O
it O
so O
elegant O
looking O
. O

It O
is O
quieter O
than O
when O
the O
internal O
fan O
of O
my O
laptop O
is O
running O
on O
full O
speed O
, O
but O
my O
laptop O
fan O
runs O
intermittently O
whereas O
the O
Cooling O
Pad O
fan O
runs O
continuously O
. O

Definitely O
not O
the O
best O
solution O
. O

The O
construction O
is O
fabulous O
and O
the O
security O
features O
very O
reassuring O
. O

It O
really O
does O
look O
like O
a O
tattered O
, O
old O
envelope O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
and O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
fast O
ultraportable O
. O

Let O
's O
face O
it O
all O
netbooks O
are O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
hardware O
. O

But O
the O
price O
is O
not O
warranted O
. O

It O
is O
obviously O
a O
global O
model O
; O
I O
had O
to O
snap O
in O
a O
US O
plug O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
set O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
! O

That O
aside O
, O
they O
offered O
and O
delivered O
a O
new O
battery O
, O
offered O
another O
, O
and O
then O
offered O
a O
full O
refund O
. O

Only O
this O
one O
is O
plastic O
and O
black O
color O
. O

Quality O
- O
High O

The O
images O
were O
not O

Easy O
to O
type O
on O
. O

I O
have O
2 O
of O
my O
own O
and O
I O
like O
them O
, O
so O
when O
my O
friend O
said O
she O
was O
looking O
for O
one O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
this O
laptop O
sleeve O
in O
anticipation O
of O
the O
laptop O
or O
netbook O
Iam O
thinking O
of O
ordering O
, O
as O
a O
companion O
to O
my O
desktop O
computer O
. O

If O
there O
is O
anything O
that O
I O
could O
say O
that O
could O
be O
improved O
on O
this O
TV O
, O
it O
is O
the O
automatic O
volume O
control O
that O
is O
supposed O
to O
level O
the O
volume O
of O
comercials O
. O

It O
was O
maybe O
3 O
hours O
. O

very O
good O
deal O
. O

Netbooks O
( O
TSM097US O
) O
, O
which O
had O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
specs O
but O
was O
cheaper O
( O
always O
a O
good O
thing O
) O
. O

This O
sleeve O
offers O
basic O
protection O
for O
my O
Air O

This O
new O
cord O
works O
great O
and O
now O
I O
can O
keep O
this O
cord O
in O
my O
pc O
carrying O
case O
and O
keep O
my O
other O
cord O
plugged O
in O
at O
home O

I O
bought O
mine O
from O
Apple O
. O

it O
actually O
states O
this O
in O
the O
description O
of O
the O
product O
as O
well O
. O

You O
STILL O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
Cinema O
, O
Podcast O
and O
HD O
plugins O
. O

Since O
this O
is O
essentially O
what O
I O
will O
be O
using O
the O
machine O
for O
, O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
had O
designed O
the O
cable O
to O
come O
from O
the O
back O
instead O
of O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
sound O
is O
more O
than O
adequate O
for O
presentations O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
use O
that O
pocket O
for O
that O
. O

It O
handled O
the O
high O
volume O
with O
minimal O
distortion O
with O
the O
bass O
heavy O
music O
. O

love O
n O
peace O
to O
all O
in O
2012 O

When O
lid O
is O
closed O
, O
and O
laptop O
is O
packed O
in O
a O
bag O
for O
transport O
, O
it O
takes O
very O
little O
pressure O
to O
& O
# O
34;push&#34 O
; O
the O
screen O
against O
the O
keyboard O
/ O
touchpad O
area O
. O

It O
is O
more O
than O
a O
month O
since O
I O
replaced O
- O
No O
issues O
so O
far O
. O

A O
year O
later O
, O
I O
would O
not O
buy O
the O
bag O
if O
I O
had O
it O
to O
do O
over O
again O
. O

I O
REALLY O
miss O
my O
i5 O
chip O
and O
the O
almost O
completely O
flawless O
environment O
of O
my O
Windows O
7 O
laptop O
with O
msi O
components O
. O

Blows O
away O
netbooks O
because O
of O
superior O
i3 O
processor O
. O

Really O
nice O
. O

To O
the O
point O
where O
I O
found O
it O
much O
faster O
to O
type O
on O
the O
touchscreen O
keyboard O
than O
on O
this O
one O
. O

I O
enjoy O
the O
Corel O
Painter O
Essentials O
( O
I O
use O
much O
of O
the O
corel O
software O
) O
, O
because O
it O
can O
also O
do O
a O
wonderful O
job O
of O
converting O
photos O
to O
paintings O
, O
chalk O
drawings O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
could O
not O
be O
more O
pleased O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

Using O
it O
for O
one O
16 O
' O
strip O
of O
LEDs O
. O

( O
If O
you O
're O
traveling O
, O
I O
'm O
sorry O
you O
'll O
just O
have O
to O
have O
messy O
hair O
. O

I O
was O
unable O
to O
run O
all O
my O
cables O
through O
the O
cable O
management O
space O
provided O
. O

this O
unit O
is O
very O
solid O
and O
works O
well O
with O
my O
Dell O
15&#34 O
; O
laptop O
. O

I O
settled O
on O
the O
backpack O
type O
of O
camera O
bag O
because O
I O
was O
going O
to O
travel O
and O
even O
walking O
in O
national O
parks O
; O
I O
figured O
a O
backpack O
was O
more O
comfortable O
to O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
camera O
equipment O
. O

My O
first O
impression O
was O
& O
# O
34;Wow O
, O
this O
freaking O
thing O
is O
heavy!&#34 O
; O

We O
plugged O
in O
this O
replacement O
pwr O
cord O
and O
it O
works O
perfect O
. O

A O
great O
addition O
to O
an O
already O
great O
machine O
. O

Internet O
radio O
is O
rad O
. O

The O
I O
like O
all O
the O
USB O
ports O
, O
HDMI O
, O
VGA O
options O
. O

and O
I O
've O
found O
the O
size O
of O
it O
to O
be O
quite O
convenient O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

For O
the O
record O
, O
I O
am O
running O
it O
on O
a O
one O
year O
old O
Dell O
XPS O
Studio O

with O
a O
new O
clean O

As O
part O
of O
a O
lead O
review O
of O
our O
home O
we O
found O
that O
my O
laptop O
cool O
pad O
is O
32ppm O
lead O
. O

The O
benefit O
of O
the O
350 O
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
it O
's O
big O
enough O
to O
be O
my O
single O
carry O
- O
on O
bag O
for O
a O
day O
or O
weekend O
trip O
. O

so O
i O
wedged O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
behind O
it O
to O
prop O
it O
up O
now O

For O
less O
than O
$ O
20 O
, O
I O
paid O
for O
; O
I O
was O
not O
expecting O
it O
to O
come O
with O
an O
extra O
charger O
which O
defeats O
portability O
. O

I O
am O
amazed O
by O
the O
performance O

one O
which O
was O

of O
its O

I O

it O
. O

The O

extremely O

the O

does O

it O

I O

fix O
it O

After O

it O
worked O

On O
the O

I O

Thought O
for O
sure O
I O
am O
doing O
something O
wrong O
. O

Installation O
was O
simple O
. O

Amazon O
has O
the O
best O
price O
for O
100 O
' O
cables O
. O

16GHz O
powerhouse O
laptop O
to O
2 O
. O

The O
design O
is O
interesting O
, O
in O
that O
the O
laptop O
can O
slide O
inside O
the O
cooler O
for O
transport O
in O
a O
laptop O
bag O
, O
which O
makes O
portability O
more O
compact O
despite O
the O
large O
size O
. O

Thus O
, O
if O
you O
try O
to O
use O
Linksys O
wireless O
products O
for O
online O
gaming O
, O
prepare O
to O
be O
VERY O
annoyed O
. O

Seriously O
, O
I O
got O
it O
at O
Best O
Buy O
for O
over O
$ O
80 O
, O
then O
found O
it O
at O
WalMart O
for O
$ O
65 O
, O
then O
found O
it O
here O
for O
... O

This O
product O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
cooler O
last O
year O
at O
a O
retail O
store O
, O
opting O
over O
models O
that O
cost O
$ O
10 O
more O
. O

They O
worked O
good O
. O

and O
I O
would O
have O
move O
my O
laptop O
to O
regain O
the O
signal O
and O
then O
move O
it O
back O
to O
my O
desk O
where O
it O
would O
work O
for O
awhile O
. O

Even O
when O
doing O
simple O
tasks O
, O
this O
is O
too O
slow O
to O
be O
really O
useful O
. O

This O
Micro O
USB O
is O
-not- O
extra O
long O
, O
just O
normal O
length O
, O
so O

Once O
again O
, O
not O
a O
major O
deal O
to O
me O
. O

The O
new O
FiiO O
Mont O
Blanc O
( O
no O
affiliation O
with O
Mont O
Blanc O
writing O
pens O
) O
headphone O
amp O
is O
about O
the O
same O
length O
as O
the O
iPhone O
4s O
, O
about O
1/4 O
inch O
wider O
, O
and O
about O
50 O
percent O
thicker O
, O
which O
is O
still O
very O
slim O
for O
the O
overall O
size O
. O

It O
's O
time O
for O
ASUS O
to O
go O
away O
and O
leave O
us O
all O
alone O
! O

Which O
means O
we O
just O
keep O
helping O
the O
community O
by O
answering O
questions O
, O
providing O
tips O
, O
app O
ideas O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
love O
the O
blue O
curser O
arrow O
and O
the O
touch O
pad O
is O
responsive O
and O
accurate O
. O

It O
is O
directly O
below O
said O
natural O
position O
, O
and O
without O
a O
conscious O
effort O
to O
avoid O
it O
, O
you O
inevitably O
will O
obscure O
it O
during O
normal O
use O
. O

If O
you O
can O
tolerate O
its O
minor O
problems O
and O
be O
patient O
with O
its O
flaws O
, O
I O
'd O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
. O

Bummer O
, O
but O
not O
a O
deal O
breaker O
... O
just O
an O
annoyance O
. O

I O
did O
have O
problems O
trying O
to O
charge O
my O
Asus O
tablet O
with O
this O
product O
. O

In O
my O
room O
lighting O
situation O
, O
with O
table O
lamps O
almost O
directly O
opposite O
the O
screen O
, O
I O
'm O
really O
glad O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
the O
650 O
. O

It O
made O
a O
movie O

Google O
tries O
to O
steer O
you O
towards O
their O
own O
video O
- O
chat O
service O
( O
anybody O
surprised O
? O
) O
, O
but O
all O
my O
friends O
use O
Skype O
. O

I O
'm O
happy O
with O
OS O
X O
user O
interface O
; O
it O
crashes O
gracefully O
... O
even O
though O
it O
crashes O
much O
more O
frequently O
than O
any O
windows O
PC O
I O
ever O
had O
, O
but O
when O
it O
does O
, O
it O
just O
goes O
dark O
, O
not O
like O
Windows O
and O
the O
annoying O
blue O
screen O
. O

It O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
surprise O
when O
I O
discovered O
that O
my O
Dell O
XPS O
13 O
ultrabook O
does O
not O
have O
an O
ethernet O
port O
, O
which O
I O
need O
for O
work O
. O

The O
print O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

, O
it O
wows O
every O
one O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
cool O
you O
or O
the O
laptop O
. O

It O
also O
offers O
a O
microphone O
input O
( O
something O
Sony O
does O
n't O
in O
this O
class O
) O
something O
that O
's O
very O
important O
if O
you O
decide O
to O
add O
an O
external O
microphone O
for O
really O
professional O
audio O
. O

The O
size O
is O
similar O
to O
a O
thinner O
desktop O
keyboard O
. O

Cons O
( O
or O
possibly O
just O
some O
Considerations O
) O

This O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
little O
laptop O
except O
for O
one O
very O
important O
issue O
. O

] O
And O
be O
advised O
that O
the O
2star O
average O
is O
biased O
upward O
by O
at O
least O
1&1/2 O
stars O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
Verizon O
( O
like O
Amazon O
) O
requires O
a O
reviewer O
to O
report O
a O
minimum O
of O
1 O
star O
or O
the O
review O
can O
not O
be O
submitted O
. O

Good O
replacement O
and O
great O
price O
. O

They O
work O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

It O
's O
a O
terrific O
deal O
. O

At O
around O
$ O
20 O
these O
days O
, O
it O
's O
a O
steal O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
MBP O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O
and O
it O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
good O
times O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
with O
a O
small O
thumb O
drive O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
carry O
around O
, O
and O
makes O
up O
for O
no O
expandable O
memory O
on O
my O
phone O
if O
I O
need O
extra O
. O

So O
, O
my O
nimble O
husband O
removed O
all O
the O
tiny O
screws O

I O
get O
to O
play O
all O
the O
awesome O
games O
like O
heart O
of O
the O
swarm O
, O
bioshock O
, O
call O
of O
duty O
, O
dead O
island O
riptide O
etc O
, O
and O
they O
all O
run O
smooth O
, O
and O
laptop O
is O
very O
silent O
and O
never O
gets O
hot O
. O

it O
works O
pretty O
good O
. O

Just O
snip O
off O
the O
little O
HP O
logo O
tag O
and O
you O
're O
all O
set O
. O

It O
does O
NOT O
control O
the O
zoom O
function O
. O

I O
love O
the O
bristles O
they O
're O
not O
too O
soft O
or O
to O
brittle O

All O
components O
of O
the O
computer O
are O
under O
a O
little O
panel O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
! O

Had O
to O
remove O
the O
LCD O
screen O
again O
and O
reinstall O
it O
. O

Also O
it O
claims O
made O
of O
leather O
... O

Hopefully O
this O
review O
is O
helpful O
to O
others O
that O
are O
new O
to O
Apple O
and O
trying O
to O
learn O
this O
system O
, O
which O
WILL O
take O
some O
time O
and O
effort O
or O
for O
folks O
that O
are O
considering O
spending O
$ O
1400 O
. O
00 O

and O
I O
decided O
& O
# O
34;Whoa O
, O
not O
cool O
, O
need O
a O
new O
one!&#34 O
; O

so O
i O
never O
gave O
it O
another O
try O
. O

Bass O
is O
decent O
. O

The O
stock O
one O
lasted O
at O
least O
twice O
as O
long O
, O
until O
it O
died O
recently O
. O

the O
bottom O
cover O
does O
not O
provide O
very O
much O
ventilation O
for O
cool O
air O
to O
hit O
it O
. O

I O
had O
to O
use O
the O
transmitter O
that O
came O
with O
the O
receiver O
. O

I O
had O
to O
try O
to O
jam O
the O
keys O
down O
without O
breaking O
the O
keyboard O
itself O
. O

I O
've O
bought O
AGPTEK O
batteries O
for O
both O
MAC O
and O
IBM O
, O
and O
even O
an O
older O
DELL O
notebook O
. O

So O
I O
tested O
it O
again O
with O
just O
using O
internet O

It O
has O
been O
on O
many O
assignments O
with O
me O
and O
has O
n't O
failed O
me O
yet O
! O

Last O
year O
my O
laptop O
got O
fried O
while O
connecting O
to O
an O
external O
RAID O
enclosure O
while O
using O
this O
card O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
'm O
stuck O
with O
it O
. O

but O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
with O
tons O
of O
programs O
, O
pages O
and O
music O
open O
. O

I O
love O
that O
it O
zips O
and O
protects O
it O
while O
it O
is O
in O
my O
purse O
or O
bag O
! O

Whenever O
it O
pairs O
it O
wants O
me O
to O
type O
a O
code O
onto O
the O
keyboard O
to O
verify O
. O

After O
recording O
a O
dance O
recital O
, O
here O
's O
my O
experience:- O

I O
am O
a O
college O
student O
only O
3 O
months O
away O
from O
getting O
my O
Masters O
Degree O
in O
computer O
information O
science O
. O

I O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
tactile O
aspect O
of O
the O
case O
insures O
that O
it O
wo O
n't O
slide O
off O
a O
desk O
or O
table O
while O
still O
maintaining O
that O
sleek O

This O
device O
died O
after O
just O
a O
few O
months O
. O

I O
use O
Bible O
software O
extensively O
on O
my O
PC O
, O
but O
there O
's O
only O
one O
decent O
product O
available O
for O
Mac O
OS O
X O
, O
and O
it O
's O
really O
expensive O
. O

As O
an O
IT O
guy O
I O
use O
this O
bag O
to O
hold O
my O
MacBook O

The O
buttons O
being O
down O
the O
side O
stead O
of O
across O
the O
bottom O
are O
not O
really O
practical O
, O
as O
you O
have O
to O
use O
two O
hands O
to O
depress O
a O
button O
and O
move O
the O
mouse O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
compartments O
for O
holding O
all O
of O
your O
papers O
and O
files O
. O

The O
power O
cord O
is O
not O
as O
long O
as O
the O
factory O
one O
, O
probably O
a O
good O
12 O
inches O
shorter O
. O

Obviously O
, O
the O
output O
is O
different O
on O
the O
USB O
ports O
. O

I O
love O
the O
material O
, O
the O
shape O
and O
even O
i O
can O
use O
it O
to O
storage O
my O
tablet O
great O
purchase O
. O

I O
've O
noticed O
that O
if O
my O
netbook O
wo O
n't O
register O
the O
Alfa O
it O
's O
because O
it O
's O
time O
for O
an O
update O
. O

The O
sleeve O
fits O
tightly O
into O
a O
pocket O
on O
the O
400 O
's O
back O
cover O
. O

In O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
time O
, O
she O
's O
changed O
batteries O
twice O
while O
I O
'm O
still O
using O
the O
original O
batteries O
it O
came O
with O
, O
even O
with O
many O
hours O
/ O
day O
usage O
. O

Ever O
since O
I O
have O
found O
very O
little O
reason O
to O
use O
my O
laptop O
and O
desktop O
computers O
. O

and O
they O
will O
not O
work O
correctly O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
computer O
literate O
and O
was O
hoping O
that O
the O
disc O
would O
be O
a O
plug O
and O
play O
. O

When O
some O
programs O
needs O
/ O
hogs O
CPU O
, O
" O
mail O
app O
" O
+ O
" O
browser O
" O
, O
the O
system O
/ O
UI O

The O
option O
to O
use O
the O
power O
cord O
is O
great O
when O
you O
have O
external O
USB O
hard O
drive O
enclosures O
that O
need O
the O
extra O
juice O
. O

it O
works O
that O
all O
i O
can O
say O
. O

I O
was O
pleased O
with O
this O
product O
, O
and O
it O
arrived O
promptly O
and O
was O
very O
well O
packaged O
. O

Installed O
Windows O
8 O
from O
a O
USB O
drive O

And O
the O
build O
quality O
is O
quite O
good O
, O
characteristically O
from O
Creative O
. O

I O
am O
primarily O
a O
Mac O
user O
, O
and O
have O
, O
among O
other O
things O
a O
MacBook O
Air O
. O

i O
also O
put O
some O
documents O
in O
a O
folder O
and O
put O
them O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

This O
works O
great O
. O

Could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

Stand O
folds O
well O
for O
travel O
. O

I O
decided O
it O
's O
time O
to O
just O
bite O
the O
bullet O
and O
try O
out O
the O
Intel O
drive O
; O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O

I O
also O
have O
aBelkin O

when O
I O
pay O
over O
$ O
1 O
, O
200 O
, O
I O
would O
expect O
it O
to O
work O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
and O
my O
search O
continues O
for O
my O
perfect O
computer O
. O

it O
is O
very O
thin O
and O
that O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
really O
fits O
the O
cursor O
keys O
well O
. O

Very O
easy O
on O
the O
ears O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
sister O
that O
's O
always O
losing O
her O
keys O
. O

My O
first O
charge O
I O
did O
the O
recommended O
cycle O
( O
found O
on O
the O
apple O
website O
) O
and O
made O
a O
conscious O
effort O
to O
use O
the O
battery O
power O
down O
to O
20 O
% O
before O
recharging O
for O
the O
first O
month O
. O

This O
will O
allow O
someone O
to O
pull O
it O
open O
. O

a O
mini O
DV O
tape O
cassette O
and O
camcorder O
or O
VCR O
playback O
unit O
needed O
to O
dump O
the O
video O
and O
stills O
to O
my O
Mac O
for O
editing O
and O
burning O
DVDs O
. O

This O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
back O
packs O
I O
have O
ever O
bought O
. O

2 O
x O
1 O
. O
7 O
x O
10 O
. O
5 O
inches O
interior O
. O

No O
more O
bags O
of O
cables O
to O
hold O
onto O
. O

The O
numeric O
keyboard O
at O
the O
side O
is O
an O
absolute O
necessity O
for O
multinational O
characters O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
my O
device O
or O
the O
charger O
, O
though O
. O

Seagate O
has O
managed O
to O
keep O
the O
drain O
on O
the O
battery O
with O
the O
320 O
GB O
identical O
to O
the O
200 O
GB O
drive O
, O
and O
while O
the O
drive O
got O
quite O
hot O
during O
the O
transfer O
of O
data O
over O
to O
the O
new O
drive O
( O
intensive O
disk O
activity O
) O
, O
the O
normal O
operating O
temperature O
seems O
the O
same O
as O
the O
200 O
GB O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

Have O
several O
other O
Rosewill O
products O
that O
have O
performed O
well O
. O

This O
47 O
" O
refurbed O
Samsung O
120Hz O
rates O
highest O
on O
all O
but O
one O
count O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
talked O
to O
a O
few O
of O
the O
techs O
in O
the O
big O
box O
stores O
- O
they O
all O
said O
they O
spend O
each O
morning O
trouble O
- O
shooting O
all O
the O
crashed O
pc O
's O
, O
but O
the O
Apple O
products O
run O
for O
months O
without O
issues O
. O

This O
laptop O
, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
one O
I O
received O
, O
has O
very O
good O
WiFi O
range O
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
the O
backpack O
I O
normally O
carry O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
light O
. O

Works O
well O
, O
much O
better O
price O
that O
OEM O
and O
has O
held O
up O
well O
over O
time O
. O

Just O
as O
good O
as O
the O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
laptop O
. O

Super O
fast O
boot O
speed O
. O

This O
feature O
should O
not O
even O
be O
included O
. O

The O
way O
the O
fabric O
is O
folded O
and O
strategically O
stitched O
create O
a O
sort O
of O
buffer O
zone O
. O

Installation O
was O
easy O
and O
quick O
. O

love O
the O
case O
! O

It O
does O
what O
I O
need O
without O
any O
lagging O
problems O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
an O
XP O
, O
and O
I O
could O
have O
bought O
Windows O
8 O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
old O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
affect O
me O
that O
much O

but O
i O
've O
given O
them O
all O
away O
to O
charity O

My O
only O
real O
complaints O
are O
that O
the O
hard O
drive O
says O
320 O
GB O
in O
the O
description O
but O
shows O
up O
as O
having O
a O
total O
of O
285 O
GB O
on O
the O
system O
( O
a O
difference O
of O
35 O
GB O
) O
, O
and O
it O
comes O
with O
Norton O
pre O
- O
installed O
, O
which O
is O
a O
bear O
to O
get O
off O
of O
the O
system O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
. O

None O
of O
the O
current O
HDTVs O
offer O
PIP O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
great O
and O
the O
key O
board O
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
I O
've O
had O
in O
a O
laptop O
. O

and O
it O
was O
the O
last O
piece O
. O

There O
is O
a O
reason O
why O
there O
's O
no O
un O
- O
boxing O
videos O
for O
this O
computer O
. O

When O
used O
as O
a O
thin O
client O
it O
gives O
the O
IT O
department O
no O
risks O
whatsoever O
because O
all O
the O
personal O
stuff O
the O
user O
can O
do O
with O
the O
computer O
remains O
in O
the O
public O
cloud O
... O
when O
at O
work O
, O
all O
corporate O
data O
remains O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
firmware O
in O
the O
BIOS O
repositories O
is O
older O
than O
the O
installed O
BIOS O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
this O
speaker O
is O
a O
PROVEN O
WINNER O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
you O
hear O
me O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O

my O
initial O
impression O
is O
it O
is O
every O
bit O
as O
good O
as O
the O
ORIGINAL O
if O
not O
better O
... O

I O
've O
used O
lots O
of O
Amazon O
Basics O
prodcuts O
for O
my O
AV O
needs O
and O
all O
have O
worked O
to O
ideal O
standards O
. O

totally O
recommended O

As O
for O
speed O
it O
is O
not O
the O
fastest O
ever O
. O

The O
other O
is O
an O
Samsung O
PM8 O
SSD O
, O
which O
is O
meant O
to O
improve O
startup O
times O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
Five O
Star O
backpack O
. O

I O
have O
used O
, O
as O
stated O
my O
ear O
- O
buds O
, O
I O
have O
also O
used O
a O
keyboard O
and O
a O
speaker O
system O
of O
my O
roommates O
. O

This O
is O
an O
excellent O
price O
for O
a O
solid O
, O
necessary O
component O
. O

I O
had O
instant O
access O
to O
movies O
and O
TV O
. O

You O
can O
not O
beat O
the O
3 O
M O
film O
screen O
for O
privacy O
, O
especially O
in O
a O
corporate O
setting O
where O
data O
is O
especially O
sensitive O
. O

Although O
you O
can O
not O
change O
the O
desktopimages O
from O
Win O
Starter O
... O
you O
can O
download O
software O
that O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
do O
this O
. O

And O
the O
weight O
feels O
about O
the O
same O
despite O
the O
larger O
size O
. O

Would O
I O
rather O
take O
this O
machine O
with O
me O
when O
traveling O
and O
have O
full O
access O
to O
every O
web O
site O
that O
I O
normally O
access O
via O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
in O
my O
home O
? O

I O
have O
the O
game O
's O
layout O
displayed O
in O
the O
Logitech O
gaming O
software O
on O
the O
right O
monitor O
. O

After O
that O
the O
hard O
drive O
power O
connector O
was O
not O
sized O
correctly O
and O
it O
had O
to O
be O
forced O
into O
the O
hard O
drive O
. O

This O
adapter O
is O
rock O
solid O
, O
and O
performs O
just O
as O
such O
. O

I O
was O
struggling O
with O
this O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
now O
, O
connecting O
an O
nvidia O
card O
through O
my O
receiver O
to O
a O
TV O
. O

These O
are O
always O
my O
fall O
back O
cable O
drops O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
the O
older O
version O
of O
this O
laptop O
still O
on O
sale O
at O
Amazon O
( O
model O
M5 O
- O
481PT-6488 O
) O
as O
it O
often O
locks O
up O
when O
resuming O
from O
sleep O
/ O
hibernation O
. O

I O
NEVER O
meant O
to O
imply O
that O
this O
vendor O
was O
IN O
ANY O
WAY O
responsible O
for O
stealing O
so O
much O
as O
a O
paper O
clip O
. O

The O
keyboard O
back O
- O
lighting O
is O
really O
bright O
. O

Since O
the O
new O
iMac O
only O
had O
Firewire O
800 O
, O
I O
needed O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
cable O
to O
transfer O
files O
. O

Works O
great O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
. O

very O
simple O
and O
sleek O
. O

Not O
disappointed O
by O
this O
camera O
at O
all O
. O

I O
works O
well O
with O
my O
old O
desktop O
running O
Windows O
XP O
but O
not O
with O
the O
tablet O
. O

It O
worked O
for O
what O
I O
needed O
it O
for O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

It O
worked O
well O
when O
it O
did O
and O
the O
computer O
( O
Dell O
1501 O
) O
recognized O
it O
right O
away O
. O

The O
color O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
hard O
drive O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
at O
least O
for O
Apple O
devices O
, O
there O
's O
yet O
another O
step O
required O
to O
move O
the O
photos O
from O
the O
app O
to O
the O
camera O
roll O
and O
thus O
to O
Photo O
Share O
. O

Let O
me O
repeat O
it O
, O
place O
the O
sub O
- O
woofer O
on O
a O
reflective O
surface O
, O

Perfect O
size O
for O
those O
intermediate O

BatteriesThese O

trickle O
away O
even O
when O

) O

and O
I O
truly O
have O
only O
one O
connection O
to O
the O

But O
I O
was O
just O
glad O
to O
get O

This O
is O
awesome O
, O
so O
happy O
(: O
... O

Got O
Widcomm O
software O
to O
uninstall O
. O

I O
had O
researched O
it O
online O

Audio O
CD O
... O
seeking O
and O
clicking O

I O
finally O
edged O
it O
to O
the O
Sony O
Bravia O
, O
Toshiba O
Regza O
, O
and O
this O
model O
. O

I O
'm O
currently O
using O
this O
cable O
to O
interface O
a O
computer O
with O
a O
TV O
. O

I O
used O
this O
for O
almost O
2 O
years O
to O
carry O
my O
computer O
and O
tools O
to O
a O
factory O
that O
was O
under O
construction O
. O

Net O
result O

I O
've O
enjoyed O
using O
this O
bag O
so O
far O
. O

Avoid O
the O
cheap O
offbrand O
batteries O
as O
you O
never O
know O
what O
testing O
standards O
they O
have O
used O
. O

Its O
super O
quiet O
and O
one O
great O
thing O
is O
, O
no O
exposed O
fans O
like O
other O
coolers O
. O

All O
that O
low O
voltage O
technology O
and O
it O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
past O
3 O
hours O
? O

However O
, O
this O
product O
is O
a O
poor O
release O
with O
abysmal O
product O
testing O
with O
regard O
to O
WIFI O
connectivity O
. O

the O
sound O
quality O
is O
not O
great O

I O
can O
run O
anything O
externally O
that O
I O
would O
with O
a O
desktop O
( O
printer O
, O
speakers O
, O
keyboard O
, O
mouse O
) O
straight O
off O
the O
dock O

Would O
recommend O
. O

this O
china O
crap O
buy O
a O
better O
one O

It O
works O
well O
and O
is O
easy O
to O
take O
with O
you O
in O
your O
laptop O
bag O
. O

and O
I O
have O
never O
found O
a O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
that O
is O
as O
responsive O
as O
a O
wired O
keyboard O
. O

Skype O
video O
chat O
works O
. O

Big O
diffrence O
in O
viewing O
videos O
on O
you O
tube O
and O
all O
around O
opening O
new O
windows O
and O
searches O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
you O
need O
to O
have O
blu O
- O
ray O
player O
software O
like O
powerdvd O
12 O
or O
arc O

Two O
rubber O
pads O
are O
set O
into O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
battery O
as O
& O

8216;feet&#8217 O
; O
, O
since O
the O
original O
rear O
feet O
of O
the O
machine O
are O
elevated O
off O
the O
surface O
by O
the O
battery O
. O

While O
I O
love O
gaming O
, O
I O
barely O
use O
it O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

Poor O
quality O
. O

The O
difference O
in O
resolution O
was O
immediately O
evident O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
case O
for O
my O
Samsung O
12 O
. O

I O
am O
a O
financial O
trader O
and O
travel O
a O
lot O
. O

It O
connects O
easy O
but O
some O
programs O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
play O
nice O
and O
you O
have O
to O
go O
in O
and O
change O
what O
port O
there O
reading O
from O
. O

It O
's O
super O
snug O
. O

This O
one O
looks O
good O
, O
fits O
well O
, O
and O
I O
like O
the O
little O
feet O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

our O
router O
broadcasts O
and O
we O
can O
connect O
to O
it O
with O
other O
devices O
at O
speeds O
around O
75Mbps O
to O
85Mbps O
including O
wirelessly O
connecting O
my O
work O
laptop O
to O
the O
network O
and O
Internet O
. O

I O
fully O
ejected O
then O
reinserted O
the O
card O
and O
got O
full O
bandwidth O
. O

This O
HP O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
as O
a O
gift O
at O
the O
given O
price O
point O
and O
has O
been O
running O
fine O
for O
light O
use O
. O

I O
used O
a O
butter O
Knife O
to O
separate O
the O
back O
of O
the O
slate O
from O
the O
front O
. O

I O
can O
just O
drop O
the O
Asus O
into O
my O
purse O
for O
easy O
access O
when O
traveling O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O
keyboard O
after O
my O
daughter O
stepped O
on O
my O
original O
kb O
. O

This O
machine O
however O
is O
just O
plain O
not O
even O
usable O
for O
the O
most O
basic O
of O
tasks O
to O
be O
considered O
operational O
. O

All O
of O
them O
worked O
well O
. O

Although O
Lenovo O
provides O
official O
drivers O
for O
Windows O
8 O
, O
the O
display O
connection O
is O
slow O
and O
the O
drivers O
slow O
down O
Windows O
8 O
apps O
. O

If O
they O
are O
the O
same O
, O
Your O
are O
good O
with O
this O
product O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
mgsrv32 O
froze O
, O
so O

So O
my O
overall O
impression O
? O

( O
or O
... O
5 O
ish O
, O
but O
really O
, O
when O
your O
laptop O
weighs O
less O
then O

This O
thing O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
need O
it O
to O
do O
. O

after O
my O
3 O
year O
old O
had O
pulled O
off O
most O
of O
my O
number O
keys O
i O
needed O
a O
new O
keyboard O
. O

When O
I O
go O
somewhere O

Well O
, O
almost O
done O
. O

As O
this O
is O
a O
bedroom O
set O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
an O
elaborate O
audio O
set O
- O
up O
. O

You O
can O
find O
alot O
of O
the O
add O
- O
ons O
here O
on O
Amazon O
and O
also O
on O
Ebay O
. O

If O
its O
in O
one O
room O
with O
pc O
= O
its O
fast O
, O
but O
if O
one O
wall O
and O
30 O

forget O

frankly O
they O
all O
look O

so O
you O

Otherwise O
you O
will O

but O
so O

so O

It O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
navigate O
back O

the O

extra O

The O
MBP O
actually O
moves O
about O
, O
especially O
up O
/ O
down O
with O
this O
sleeve O
. O

I O
have O
a O
gaming O
laptop O
that O
tend O
to O
get O
hot O
over O
time O
an O
this O
keep O
is O
cool O
. O

At O
any O
given O
time O
, O
it O
may O
be O
either O
too O
sensitive O
or O
not O
sensitive O
enough O
causing O
me O
to O
move O
objects O
when O
attempting O
to O
select O
them O
or O
any O
number O
of O
other O
mis O
- O
assigned O
functions O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
bag O
in O
less O
than O
2 O
weeks O
, O
that O
I O
have O
ordered O
through O
Amazon O
for O
my O
netbook O
. O

No O
real O
bass O
, O
or O
treble O
due O
to O
the O
3 O
inch O
rubberized O
speaker O
. O

I O
used O
this O
same O
monitor O
with O
a O
previous O
laptop O
and O
it O
performed O
which O
ever O
way O
I O
told O
it O
too O
. O

I O
made O
a O
mounting O
bracket O
that O
works O
great O
but O
should O
not O
have O
to O
go O
to O
such O
effort O
. O

This O
wireless O
mouse O
is O
efficient O
, O
sleek O
, O
and O
just O
wonderful O
to O
look O
at O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
more O
wrong O
. O

All O
my O
items O
show O
on O
boot O
and O
never O
get O
lost O
. O

This O
backpack O
is O
really O
cool O
. O

To O
my O
surprise O
, O
it O
connected O
very O
quickly O
( O
yippee O
! O
) O
, O
but O
right O
when O
the O
connection O
was O
completed O
, O
my O
TV O
screen O
turned O
completely O
black O
and O
my O
laptop O
monitor O
flickered O
and O
readjusted O
the O
display O
resolution O
as O
if O
I O
had O
connected O
it O
to O
an O
external O
monitor O
. O

I O
even O
considered O
using O
it O
with O
an O
alternate O
( O
bluetooth O
) O
keyboard O
, O
but O
mine O
was O
not O
compatible O
. O

In O
my O
case O
, O
that O
was O
fine O
, O
and O
I O
received O
it O
in O
about O
a O
week O
. O

To O
anyone O
considering O
making O
switch O
, O
I O
say O
go O
for O
it O
... O

It O
fitted O
well O
in O
my O
netbook O
and O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
; O
would O
buy O
if O
another O
netbook O
falls O
into O
my O
hands O
that O
have O
a O
broken O
keyboard O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
its O
windows O
8 O
or O
the O
hardware O
or O
both O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
just O
open O
a O
small O
gap O
big O
enough O
to O
slip O
the O
laptop O
inside O
and O
out O
like O
most O
other O
sleeves O
, O
it O
actually O
opens O
up O
a O
full O
180 O
degrees O
. O

All O
the O
aps O
are O
listed O
right O
there O
. O

& O
I O
can O
use O
my O
laptop O
for O
hours O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
heat O
. O

Quality O
product O
from O
a O
quality O
producer O
. O

Nice O
and O
sturdy O
. O

What O
a O
surprise O
- O
my O
dock O
is O
still O
a O
$ O
200 O
paperweight O
... O

me O
but O
good O
enough O
over O
a O
few O
years O
would O
eventually O
cause O
the O
drive O
to O
fail O
prematurely O
. O

I O
live O
in O
a O
dusty O
climate O
and O
there O
is O
a O
perfect O
220 O
mm O
circle O
of O
dust O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
my O
laptop O
, O
so O
I O
can O
tell O
that O
the O
air O
only O
flows O
where O
the O
fan O
blades O
are O
located O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
repeatedly O
to O
get O
Tech O
Support O
or O
live O
chat O
or O
anything O
I O
could O
from O
ASUS O
and O
to O
No O
Avail O
! O

I O
brought O
this O
boombox O
from O
Target O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

I O
just O
got O
it O
the O
other O
day O

NOT O
TO O
WRITE O
A O
BAD O
REVIEW O
. O

So O
why O
is O
it O
almost O
perfect O
? O

The O
plug O
cover O
- O
slash O
- O
prop O
is O
a O
nice O
detail O
. O

My O
Viewsonic O
projector O
was O
a O
power O
hog O

it O
just O
started O
holding O
a O
charge O
randomly O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
later O
. O

One O
by O
my O
desk O
; O
one O
where O
my O
coffee O
grinder O
, O
Verizon O
Home O
Phone O
Connect O
, O
and O
water O
boiler O
are O
connected O
; O
and O
one O
in O
my O
car O
attached O
to O
my O
inverter O
attached O
with O
velcro O
to O
the O
transmission O
hump O
; O
and O
finally O
, O
one O
in O
my O
notebook O
bag O
for O
just O
in O
case O
. O

I O
can O
notice O
and O
feel O
a O
difference O
, O
but O
I O
would O
say O
it O
is O
only O
helping O
a O
little O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O

so O
I O
researched O
and O
ordered O
this O
Lenovo O
. O

They O
have O
a O
program O
that O
claims O
it O
will O
provide O
a O
free O
tip O
if O
you O
have O
some O
obscure O
computer O
that O
the O
included O
tips O
do O
n't O
match O
. O

Appealing O
design O
- O
the O
Antec O
USB O
- O
Powered O
Notebook O
Cooler O
( O
Pearl O
) O
looks O
very O
nice O
. O

There O
are O
several O
improvements O
in O
this O
version O
compared O
to O
the O
2011 O
MBPRO O

" O
that O
I O
owned O
previously O

all O
the O

I O
am O
beginning O
to O
think O
there O
is O
an O
issue O
with O
this O
device O
instead O
of O
a O
driver O
or O
other O
issue O
. O

Most O
thin O

use O

it O
's O
right O
there O
( O
along O
with O
my O

have O
a O
lap O
desk O
for O
my O
laptop O
, O
and O
the O
air O
works O
on O
it O
perfectly O
. O

Apple O
has O
created O
a O
laptop O
that O
will O
never O
be O
forgotten O
. O

Fix O
for O
shortness O
. O

Nice O
cable O
for O
the O
price O

Together O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
kernel O
panic O
on O

. O

She O
closes O
the O

and O
it O
goes O
to O
sleep O
, O
she O
opens O
it O
and O
it O
wakes O
up O
automatically O
( O
which O
is O
a O
great O
feature O
that O
not O
enough O
laptops O
have O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
at O
MacBooks O
) O
. O

is O
my O
second O
HP O
laptop O
in O
less O
than O
1 O
year O

Easy O
on O
and O
easy O
off O
. O

Got O
my O
wonderful O
Creative O
webcam O
, O
proudly O
installed O
the O
software O
, O
uninstalled O
the O

, O
installed O
the O

, O
uninstalled O
the O

. O

They O
are O
very O
powerfull O
and O
light O
laptops O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
wondering O
, O
the O
Ibook O
G4 O
is O
ten O
timmes O
better O
than O
the O
ibook O
before O
the O
G4 O
. O

This O
adapter O
is O
cheaply O
made O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
successfully O
pair O
it O
with O
my O
Mac O
Book O
Pro O
, O
iPod O
, O
iPad O
and O
Blackberry O
Tour O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
backpack O
feels O
very O
comfortable O
, O
and O
even O
with O
a O
camera O
body O
, O
three O
lenses O
, O
and O
a O
book O
, O
the O
bag O
feels O
surprisingly O
light O
when O
on O
my O
back O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
not O
sure O
how O
much O
longer O
Canon O
can O
keep O
charging O
$ O
30 O
for O
a O
piece O
of O
plastic O
. O

It O
has O
an O
ample O
supply O
of O
ports O
, O
which O
provide O
excellent O
connectivity O
. O

The O
picture O
it O
produces O
is O
superb O
and O
no O
issues O
even O
at O
ten O
feet O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
highest O
configuration O
( O
core O
i O
, O
7 O
. O
256 O
GB O
SSD O
, O
8 O
GB O
of O
ram O
) O
this O
laptop O
has O
a O
very O
serious O
shortfall O
. O

I O
have O
run O
out O
of O
places O
to O
plug O
USB O
devices O
into O
my O
camera O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
compare O
Chrome O
to O
Windows O
as O
this O
is O
only O
a O
review O
on O
the O
laptop O
itself O
. O

on O
one O
side O
you O
stick O
the O
power O
block O
which O
is O
pretty O
small O
. O

days O
later O
, O
this O
arrived O
and O
I O
installed O
it O
on O
her O
laptop O
- O
easiest O
job O
ever O
and O
the O
results O
a+ O

It O
works O
great O
, O
fits O
fine O
( O
yes O
, O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
's O
not O
an O
original O
part O
, O
because O
it O
's O
VERY O
slightly O
raised O
from O
the O
surrounding O
surface O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
at O
all O
) O
, O
the O
packaging O
was O
more O
sturdy O
and O
professional O
than O
the O
others O
I O
've O
tried O
, O
and O
the O
system O
recognized O
the O
battery O
immediately O
and O
began O
charging O
. O

The O
labels O
looked O
different O
from O
ones O
I O
have O
bought O
. O

While O
these O
cord O
wrappers O
help O
with O
the O
tangled O
mess O
, O
they O
also O
make O
the O
headphone O
wire O
curled O
when O
you O
unwind O
them O
for O
listening O
purposes O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
buy O
another O
for O
another O
computer O
I&#8217;ve O
converted O
from O
XP O
. O

1/21-I O
was O
told O
the O
e O
- O
mail O
to O
a O
case O
manager O
was O
sent O
marked O
as O
a O
priority O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
either O
, O
buy O
the O
Air O
. O

and O
they O
kindly O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
, O
which O
had O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

I O
have O
only O
had O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
, O
and O
have O
used O
it O
some O
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
they O
came O
with O
a O
travel O
pouch O
, O
two O
AAA O
batteries O
( O
only O
one O
is O
needed O
for O
power O
) O
, O
and O
two O
adapters O
. O

The O
performance O
is O
everything O
that O
was O
promised O
and O
it O
worked O
flawlessly O
to O
connect O
my O
two O
electronic O
devices O
. O

The O
volume O
is O
impressive O
and O
has O
lots O
of O
features O
. O

I O
was O
also O
using O
the O
MediaTech O
N O
Router O
, O
but O
that O
made O
no O
difference O
. O

Carrying O
around O
in O
a O
backpack O
( O
fit O
snugly O
) O

Swiping O
and O
navigating O
with O
the O
touchpad O
is O
fairly O
smooth O
, O
although O
I O
did O
experience O
an O
occasional O
stutters O
. O

There O
is O
a O
good O
chance O
you O
have O
one O
of O
these O
laying O
around O
also O
! O

It O
works O
great O
and O
has O
great O
response O
to O
movement O
. O

Curious O
if O
it O
was O
power O
requirements O
that O
caused O
the O
problem O
, O
I O
plugged O
in O
my O
USB O
memory O
into O
the O
hub O
. O

and O
this O
is O
a O
hoot O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

I O
use O
multiple O
peripherals O
, O
and O
like O
being O
able O
to O
plug O
them O
in O
at O
will O
without O
clogging O
up O
too O
much O
of O
my O
computer&#8217;s O
precious O
real O
estate O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
I O
think O
this O
should O
be O
expected O
. O

My O
Canon O
MG O
5220 O
printer O
software O
do O
not O
work O
as O
well O
in O
OS O
X O
as O
in O
Windows O
. O

After O
changing O
all O
of O
the O
mic O
settings O
( O
to O
no O
avail O
) O
I O
told O
him O
I O
was O
going O
to O
order O
a O
new O
microphone O
. O

When O
graphics O
is O
switched O
to O
the O
faster O
chip O
( O
this O
is O
automatic O
unless O
you O
choose O
to O
always O
use O
the O
faster O
chip O
in O
the O
energy O
preferences O
) O
, O
the O
computer O
gets O
hot O
. O

I O
have O
stuff O
on O
it O
from O
Amazon O
Unbox O
and O
CinemaNow O
and O
music O
videos O
from O
Itunes O
and O
1 O
from O
the O
zune O
store O
. O

In O
retrospect O
, O
something O
was O
probably O
wrong O
with O
that O
battery O
, O
but O
I O
just O
learned O
to O
live O
with O
it O
. O

Pairs O
easily O
. O

I O
do O
need O
a O
compact O
computer O
, O
so O

I O
actually O
dropped O
it O
from O
a O
4 O
ft O
table O
the O
second O
day O
I O
had O
it O
... O
not O
a O
scratch O
nor O
issue O
thankfully O
! O

The O
material O
is O
also O
thick O
and O
pliable O

but O
it O
is O
n't O
real O
sounding O
bass O

Bought O
this O
to O
replace O
and O
outdated O
Dell O
I O
had O
been O
running O
for O
5 O
+ O
years O
. O

It O
has O
a O
nice O
metal O
covering O
over O
the O
top O
of O
the O
plastic O
body O
and O
has O
some O
heft O
to O
it O
. O

The O
touchpad O
is O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
resistant O
to O
clicking O
than O
I O
would O
like O
. O

I O
gave O
these O
to O
my O
girlfriend O
so O
we O
could O
voice O
chat O
instead O
of O
using O
the O
internal O
microphones O
. O

For O

100 O
more O
w/ O
the O

, O
I O
'll O
take O
the O
upgrade O
to O

of O

This O
is O
a O
very O
well O

Tremendously O

27 O
July O
2012:I O
have O
been O
using O
this O
computer O
constantly O
now O
for O
about O
two O
months O
and O
it O
has O
started O
to O
show O
battery O
issues O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
power O
our O
Proform O
390E. O

The O
one O
I O
received O
is O
a O
little O
loose O
in O
any O
jack O

Stayed O
at O
an O
RV O
park O
in O
Riverside O
, O
CA O
where O
I O
could O
not O
pick O
up O
the O
wireless O
signal O
till O
I O
plugged O
in O
this O
little O
adaptor O
. O

The O
only O
possible O
recovery O
is O
to O
remove O
the O
unit O
, O
and O
then O
do O
a O
HARD O
RESET O
of O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
should O
have O
spelled O
clean O
with O
a O
" O
k O
" O
since O
I O
used O
the O
word O

Touchscreen O
is O
much O
more O
responsive O
, O
browser O
is O
faster O
, O
animations O
flow O
more O
smoothly O
, O
full O
gamepad O
compatibility O
via O
USB O
, O
better O
" O
relationship O
" O
between O
dock O
and O
tablet O
. O

and O
if O
you O
turned O
it O
higher O
, O
the O
screen O
brightness O
would O
dim O
so O
much O
that O
you O
could O
hardly O
tell O
what O
was O
on O
there O
. O

My O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
wifi O
and O
bluetooth O
reception O
. O

it O
's O
tiny O
but O
has O
terrific O
big O
sound O
for O
the O
price O
. O

True O
, O
it O
connects O
to O
your O
bluetooth O
music O
player O
, O
but O
the O
left O
and O
right O
speaker O
connect O
to O
each O
other O
with O
a O
little O
cable O
that O
is O
included O
so O
it O
is O
not O
completely O
wireless O
. O

It O
is O
made O
out O
of O
flux O
leather O
, O
not O
& O
# O
34;Leather&#34 O
; O
as O
it O
is O
advertised O
. O

I O
had O
problem O
with O
my O
Macbook O
pro O
17inch O
mid O
2009 O
. O

They O
encouraged O
feedback O
which O
is O
deserved O
. O

I O
tried O
swiveling O
it O
before O
plugging O
it O
in O
, O
but O
eventually O
had O
to O
plug O
it O
in O
to O
rotate O
it O
. O

That O
's O
maybe O
60 O
' O
from O
end O
to O
end O
, O
max O
. O

After O
reboot O
, O
Windows O
XP O
Pro O
told O
me O
it O
had O
recovered O
from O
a O
fatal O
system O
error O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
report O
the O
crash O
. O

Update O
on O
the O
review O
coming O
soon O
. O

This O
is O
a O
13 O
. O
3 O
inch O
screen O
and O
yea O

Now O
I O
have O
to O
add O
- O
after O
about O
8 O
months O
the O
battery O
will O
not O
take O
any O
charge O
- O
and O
when O
the O
battery O
is O
in O
the O
computer O
the O
battery O
indicator O
flashes O
continually O
red O
- O
then O
green O
- O
and O
the O
computer O
will O
not O
run O
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
computer O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
high O
end O
machine O
that O
has O
portability O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
know O
that O
, O
it O
's O
not O
annoying O
when O
my O
fingers O
do O
n't O
register O
movement O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
touchpad O
. O

I O
was O
a O
bit O
fearful O

I O
've O
had O
this O
bag O
for O
6 O
months O
now O
and O
love O
everything O
about O
it O
... O

JUNK O
JUNK O
JUNK O
JUNK O
JUNK O
ca O
n't O
say O
it O
enough O
. O

but O
it O
still O
it O
would O
not O
sync O
. O

it O
was O
very O
little O
cost O
out O
of O
my O
pocket O
. O

I O
have O
a O
tendency O
to O
shoot O
a O
lot O
when O
there O
's O
action O

With O
this O
plugged O
in O
, O
there O
are O
blue O
screens O
directly O
caused O
by O
the O
camera O
. O

I O
've O
had O
the O
Acer O
One O
10 O
" O
for O
about O
3 O
weeks O
and O
just O
love O
it O
! O

Outer O
pocket O
has O
my O
ziploc O
for O
lights O
and O
my O
misc O
stuff O
like O
Airborne O
, O
medicines O
, O
pens O
, O
USB O
thumbdrives O
, O
etc O
. O

Keep O
windows O
media O
player O
at O
about O
25 O
and O
speakers O
at O
about O
70 O
or O
lower O
, O
then O
set O
the O
speakers O
to O
your O
liking O
. O

The O
set O
automatically O
finds O
all O
available O
HD O
channels O
, O
allowing O
them O
to O
be O
viewed O
instead O
of O
the O
regular O
channels O
. O

It O
eliminates O
the O
need O
to O
use O
the O
trackpad O
. O

The O
keyboard O
and O
touchpad O
are O
very O
intuitive O
with O
cool O
shortcuts O
and O
gestures O
. O

The O
straps O
on O
the O
bag O
for O
storing O
monopods O
or O
tripods O
would O
be O
better O
if O
they O
had O
clips O
rather O
than O
just O
snug O
downs O
. O

The O
adapter O
size O
needs O

forced O
me O
into O
being O
bound O
o O
the O
charger O
and O
function O
like O
a O

. O

I O
am O
hoping O
the O
unit O
I O
received O
is O
simply O
defective O
and O
that O
this O
' O
whine O
' O
is O
not O
acceptable O

I O
love O
my O
Chromebook O
. O

Battery O
lasts O
~4 O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
two O
USB O
cables O
. O

The O
mounting O
system O
is O
simple O
and O
as O
long O
as O
you O
do O
n't O
plan O
on O
moving O
it O

the O

Everki O

not O

When O
I O
travel O

is O
it O
more O
convenient O
to O
throw O
my O
excellent O
Canon O

in O
my O

, O
or O
my O
big O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
system O
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
& O
love O
it O
! O

I O
've O
plugged O
in O
my O
flash O
drives O
and O
my O
MP3 O
player O
without O
a O
problem O
. O

My O
husband O
gave O
it O
to O
me O
for O
Christmas O
so O
he O
could O
take O
over O
the O

so O
we O
could O

The O
reason O
for O
only O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
stars O
: O
The O
buttons O
on O
top O

serve O
dual O

even O

Have O

with O
Google O
technician O

( O
have O
n't O
found O
a O
fix O
for O
this O
yet O
) O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
Magic O

that O
much O
for O

very O
quickly O

I O
personally O
never O
shut O
down O
this O

Originally O
, O
I O
got O
the O
anker O
keyboard O
that O
allows O
the O
ipad O
to O
be O
propped O
up O
in O
the O
groove O
. O

I O
'm O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
. O

this O
is O
a O
near O
perfect O
photo O
backpack-- O
> O
excellent O
ergonomics O
/ O
great O
fit O
( O
as O
is O
the O
case O
with O
all O
lowepro O
products O
) O
, O
excellent O
construction O
( O
as O
with O
all O
lowepro O
products O
) O
, O
good O
tripod O
holder O
, O
and O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
doing O
the O
job O
it O
implied O
( O
keeping O
my O
laptop O
in O
pristine O
condition O
) O
, O
but O
alas O
, O
it O
did O
not O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
satisfied O
with O
these O
sleeves O
. O

SurgePlus O
does O
what O
is O
expected O
, O
but O
in O
our O
situation O
( O
due O
to O
the O
granite O
thickness O
) O
the O
plug O
cover O
placed O
on O
the O
end O
does O
not O
actually O
give O
much O
support O
to O
the O
entire O
unit O
. O

Now O
all O
he O
has O
to O
do O
is O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
his O
applications O
and O
then O
he O
'll O
be O
an O
expert O
. O

The O
keys O
are O
big O
enough O
for O
my O
thick O
fingers O
can O
comfortably O
type O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O
hub O
works O
great O
; O
I O
have O
5 O
things O
plugged O
into O
it O
, O
and O
they O
all O
work O
fine O
. O

10/10 O
( O
Would O
give O
15/10 O
if O
it O
had O
given O
me O
a O
matte O
option O
) O
. O

The O
hard O
drive O
went O
. O

Setup O
was O
a O
breeze O
and O
connecting O
devices O
is O
simple O
and O
easy O
. O

There O
are O
thousands O
of O
Google O
apps O
in O
the O
Chrome O
web O
store O
. O

Got O
a O
free O
APC O
but O
it O
had O
a O
dead O
battery O
. O

A O
green O
LED O
above O
the O
USB O
outlet O
shows O
when O
the O
adapter O
has O
power O
and O
makes O
orienting O
the O
USB O
plug O
foolproof O
. O

but O
not O
the O
best O
I O
've O
seen O
. O

Used O
the O
battery O
through O
1 O
complete O
cycle O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
more O
common O
Display O
Adapter O
and O
finding O
the O
correct O
adapter O
is O
not O
easy O
. O

Part O
of O
me O
thinks O
the O
hardware O
in O
this O
device O
is O
more O
than O
adequate O
and O
Chrome O
OS O
24 O
, O
25 O
will O
be O
further O
optimized O
to O
bring O
back O
some O
of O
that O
bang O
. O

Then O
I O
move O
the O
mp3 O
files O
to O
my O
kindle O
. O

Also O
this O
one O
is O
a O
vinyl O
leather O
feel O
and O
the O
other O
was O
a O
cotton O
mesh O
. O

I O
thought O
then O
that O
the O
pad O
was O
working O
successfully O
to O
help O
keep O
the O
laptop O
cool O
. O

Originally O
$ O
30 O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
, O
it O
is O
now O
$ O
130 O
. O

The O
only O
regret O
I O
have O
, O
is O
I O
wish O
I O
would O
've O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
and O
got O
the O
15 O
" O
instead O
. O

Not O
much O
to O
say O
about O
this O
case O
, O
its O
50 O
% O
transparent O
, O
protects O
from O
scratches O
, O
matte O
color O
. O

So O
, O
the O
same O
cigarette O
lighter O
adapter O
can O
be O
used O
to O
charge O
my O
ipaq O
! O

The O
problem O
with O
the O
ATI O
gpu O
's O
is O
that O
the O
laptop O
versions O
of O
these O
are O
very O
finicky O
about O
what O
games O
they O
like O
, O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
games O
like O
there O
drivers O
. O

The O
laptop O
hangs O
out O
at O
the O
zipper O
end O
and O
can O
not O
possibly O
be O
zipped O
closed O
. O

Not O
so O
with O
the O
Tom O
Tom O
930 O
. O

I O
had O
to O
take O
the O
battery O
out O
and O
unplug O
the O
unit O
to O
hold O
the O
power O
button O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
ensure O
the O
unit O
had O
no O
charge O
left O
. O

2 O
) O
VERY O
powerful O
machine O
for O
what O
you O
pay O
for3 O
) O

I O
purchased O
this O
Toshiba O
Ultrabook O
in O
April O
, O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
light O
weight O
, O
the O
thinness O
and O
the O
SSD O
Hard O
Drive O
. O

I O
was O
sporting O
a O
Timbuk2 O
Q O
backpack O
for O
awhile O
until O
it O
was O
worn O
down O
and O
bought O
myself O
a O
new O
uptown O
backpack O
. O

The O
selling O
points O
for O
my O
wife O
were O
the O
" O
Easy O
Button O
" O
, O
in O
which O
the O
camera O
handles O
exposure O
and O
other O
settings O
to O
ensure O
an O
adequate O
picture O
( O
and O
because O
home O
videos O
look O
better O
in O
60i O
- O
24p O
would O
be O
far O
too O
stroby O
in O
that O
case O
) O
, O
and O
the O
small O
size O
of O
the O
camera O
: O
as O
other O
reviews O
have O
pointed O
out O
, O
it O
is O
the O
size O
of O
a O
soda O
can O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
small O
case O
- O
one O
just O
large O
enough O
for O
a O
laptop O
plus O
some O
files O
and O
a O
few O
extras O
like O
power O
supply O
, O
VOIP O
headset O
+ O
charger O
. O

UPDATE O
3/11/08 O
- O
I O
have O
had O
the O
bag O
for O
about O
a O
year O
now O
. O

o O
chatear O
por O
mucho O
tiempo O
. O

It O
plays O
SD O
and O
HD O
videos O
just O
fine O
with O
no O
noticeable O
lag O
. O

Love O
this O
little O
keyboard O
. O

The O
Optical O
Drive O
is O
very O
fragile O
/ O
flimsy O
! O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
those O
in O
a O
monitor O
anyhow O
. O

but O
I O
actually O
like O
the O
set O
up O
. O

It O
has O
enough O
compartments O
to O
suit O
my O
needs O
, O
provides O
enough O
protection O
for O
my O
valuable O
gear O
, O
is O
comfortable O
to O
carry O
, O
and O
it O
has O
gotten O
me O
through O
TSA O
scanner O
lines O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

So O
I O
bought O
the O
official O
replacement O
which O
came O
with O
a O
6 O
foot O
cord O
. O

With O
the O
said O
caveat O
in O
mind O
, O
this O
particular O
product O
is O
magnificent O
! O

so O
I O
was O
capable O
of O
charging O
my O
phone O
/ O
laptop O
. O

My O
dog O
chewed O
through O
the O
original O
charger O
that O
came O
with O
my O
laptop O
. O

It O
looks O
more O
refined O
and O
better O
in O
person O
. O

2 O
USB O
Smart O
Ports O
to O
charge O
ALL O
devices O
at O
their O
max O
speed O
. O

Which O
is O
nice O
, O
cause O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
it O
feel O
weak.- O
Build O
quality O
is O
great O
. O

This O
technology O
sounds O
great O

Installation O
was O
a O
non O
- O
event O
in O
that O
Win O
7 O
recognized O
it O
and O
installed O
it O
without O
any O
intervention O
from O
me O
. O

and O
the O
2 O
out O
of O
5 O
signal O
strength O
bars O
did O
n't O
go O
up O
a O
bit O
. O

Because O
these O
have O
the O
subwoofer O
somewhat O
built O
in O
, O
you O
'll O
get O
low O
rumbles O
directly O
to O
the O
ears O
and O
not O
out O
and O
around O
you O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

No O
loss O
of O
speed O
, O
supports O
both O
1 O
. O
1 O
and O
2 O
. O
0 O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
and O
can O
be O
separately O
powered O
if O
necessary O
( O
the O
device O
comes O
with O
a O
power O
adapter O
) O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
because O
it O
works O
great O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

Two O
seals O
on O
either O
end O
of O
the O
box O
and O
you O
're O
in O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
for O
the O
USB O
dongles O
as O
I O
think O
those O
look O
tacky O
hanging O
off O
the O
computer O
's O
USB O
port O
. O

I O
am O
the O
type O
of O
people O
that O
takes O
his O
time O
before O
making O
a O
decision O
regarding O
recommendations O
. O

My O
only O
problem O
at O
first O
was O
having O
to O
upgrade O
my O
internet O
because O
I O
could O
not O
get O
internet O
access O
on O
here O
at O
first O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
Anker O
products O
. O

None O
of O
them O
is O
completely O
perfect O
, O
including O
this O
Cable O
Matters O
' O
version O
, O
but O
here O
's O
where O
this O
REALLY O
works O
for O
me O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
backpack O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
. O

I O
also O
have O
Windows O
XP O
in O
the O
innotek O
VirtualBox O
which O
is O
a O
program O
that O
run O
a O
full O
OS O
inside O
Ubuntu O
's O
OS O
, O
that O
program O
gives O
you O
the O
ability O
of O
having O
Windows O
without O
having O
to O
reboot O
, O
now O
you O
can O
find O
tons O
of O
programs O
like O
this O
that O
help O
you O
switch O
OS O
without O
too O
much O
trauma O
, O
Crossover O
is O
a O
program O
that O
let O
you O
install O
and O
run O
MS O
Windows O
programs O
and O
application O
's O
on O
Linux O
. O

The O
biggest O
complaint O
about O
most O
Netbooks O
is O
the O
keyboard O
and O
the O
touchpad O
. O

A O
strip O
of O
metallic O
plastic O
which O
is O
so O
smooth O
you O
may O
begin O
to O
view O
it O
as O
just O
a O
nonfunctional O
design O
. O

I O
would O
not O
suggest O
taking O
this O
thing O
on O
a O
roadie O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
it O
pristine O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
mousepad O
, O
there O
is O
a O
pointing O
stick O
with O
2 O
buttons O
below O
the O
space O
key O
, O
allowing O
for O
either O
to O
control O
the O
cursor O
. O

Attaching O
the O
charging O
cord O
sent O
it O
into O
conniption O
fits O
, O
spontaneously O
typing O
while O
ignoring O
the O
typing O
I O
was O
attempting O
. O

This O
is O
my O
3rd O
or O
4th O
lowepro O
backpack O
( O
prior O
ones O
have O
includes O
the O
phototrekker O

So O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
without O
hesitation O
, O
but O
for O
a O
netbook O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
bunch O
of O
SD O
cards O
both O
old O
and O
new O
with O
a O
Dual O
G5 O
Mac O
running O
10 O
. O
5 O
. O

The O
package O
also O
comes O
with O
a O
cable O
for O
wired O
used O
, O
if O
bluetooth O
can O
not O
be O
used O
, O
such O
as O
on O
a O
plane O
. O

The O
zippers O
are O
pretty O
soft O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
stiff O
lining O
on O
both O
main O
compartments O
that O
is O
uncomfortable O
on O
my O
hands O
/ O
arms O
when O
reaching O
in O
the O
bag O
. O

The O
volume O
and O
track O
forward O
/ O
track O
back O
controls O
are O
large O
buttons O
on O
the O
right O
headphone O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
battery O
directly O
from O
dell O
because O
they O
were O
about O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
brand O
new O
battery O
. O

However O
, O
for O
some O
odd O
reason O
, O
if O
you O
need O
to O
use O
the O
standard O
left O
/ O
right O
audio O
out O
( O
or O
want O
to O
use O
standard O
composite O
video O
as O
well O
) O
, O
they O
have O
moved O
THAT O
plug O
to O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
HFS10 O
in O
the O
upper O
right O
corner O
, O
under O
another O
little O
rubber O
plug O
as O
irritating O
as O
the O
one O
covering O
the O
AC O
power O
in O
. O

The O
touch O
pad O
is O
easily O
disabled O
by O
pushing O
a O
button O
. O

This O
enclosure O
is O
USB O
bus O
- O
powered O
; O
no O
separate O
power O
cord O
is O
needed O
. O

This O
memory O
foam O
protects O
like O
no O
other O
case O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
I O
have O
had O
a O
great O
many O
over O
the O
years O
... O

I O
love O
how O
easily O
the O
zippers O
slide O
and O
the O
handles O
work O
perfectly O
. O

I O
upgraded O
my O
dell O
from O
xp O
to O
win7 O
and O
needed O
this O
for O
internet O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
prints O
are O
quite O
pricey O
at O
30c O
to O
45c O
each O
and O
they O
're O
a O
bit O
small O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
a O
clue O
what O
these O
chemicals O
are O
. O

Will O
I O
even O
keep O
one O
of O
these O
? O

reviewers O
described O
their O
touch O
pads O
as O
being O
difficult O
to O
use O
or O
broken O
. O

At O
this O
volume O
the O
quality O
is O
quite O
pleasant O
... O
which O
leads O
me O
to O
: O
Sound O
Quality O
: O

It O
does O
n't O
handle O

well O
but O
is O
great O
for O

I O
will O
be O
avoiding O

after O
this O
experience O

With O

One O

I O
hooked O
this O
Tv O
up O
to O
my O
Comcast O
HD O
cable O
and O
the O
picture O
is O
amazing O
! O

I O
was O
buying O
this O
to O
use O
with O
a O
Silverstone O
ML04 O
case O
which O
has O
some O
pretty O
specific O
size O
restrictions O
for O
the O
power O
supply O
and O
optical O
disc O
drive O
. O

It O
works O
, O
if O
used O
800x600 O
. O

the O
new O
tv O
does O
n't O
have O
any O
analog O
outputs O
besides O
headphone O
, O
so O
my O
options O
were O
slim O
. O

There O
are O
lots O
of O
cool O
things O
about O
the O
new O
Macbook O
Airs O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
functional O
but O
it O
looks O
good O
. O

had O
I O
gone O
with O
the O
U3 O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
that O
means O
the O
size O
specification O
is O
a O
bit O
misleading O

I O
instead O
took O
the O
plunge O
with O
this O
Android O

( O
my O
first O
ever O
Android O
device O
) O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Incredibly O
affordable O
and O
great O
priceCons:- O

Needed O
a O
longer O
cord O
for O
my O
subwoofer O
. O

BUT O
the O
main O
problem O
for O
me O
will O
be O
that O
it O
will O
have O
been O
three O
toxic O
waste O
items O
instead O
of O
one O
. O

Its O
not O
perfect O
( O
does O
n't O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
typing O
without O
the O
skin O
on O
the O
keyboard O
) O
, O
but O
it O
works O
. O

The O
eye O
cup O
arrived O
yesterday O
, O
ahead O
of O
schedule O
, O
and O
fits O
my O
camera O
perfectly O
. O

I O
replaced O
my O
old O
Intuos O
2 O
with O
this O
tablet O
and O
was O
very O
disappointed O
. O

and O
it O
woldn't O
fit O
on O
the O
wall O

Both O
of O
these O
features O
diminish O
the O
accessibility O
of O
most O
USB O
ports O
. O

It O
comes O
with O
software O
, O
but O
it O
may O
not O
work O
on O
your O
version O
of O
Windows O
. O

you O
can O
clean O
everything O
with O
it O
; O
very O
well O
packaged O
and O
with O
alot O
of O
attention O
to O
details O
. O

The O
original O
Toshiba O
adapter O
was O
a O
straight O
plug O
, O
it O
had O
no O
curve O
, O
so O
when O
you O
moved O
the O
laptop O
, O
the O
cord O
would O
get O
caught O
or O
just O
come O
unplugged O
. O

Exterior O
pockets O
are O
also O
roomy O
and O
good O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
smaller O
items O
. O

We O
bought O
one O
of O
these O
for O
each O
of O
our O
kids O
for O
Christmas O
. O

This O
items O
scroll O
button O
malfunctions O
every O
since O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
when O
surfing O
it O
really O
messes O
up O
time O
and O
flow O

With O
a O
little O
overclocking O
, O
you O
will O
find O
out O
that O
this O
little O
monster O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
hidden O
potential O
just O
waiting O
to O
be O
released O
! O

I O
've O
been O
getting O
about O
5 O
hrs O
useage O
to O
- O
date O
, O
seems O
like O
the O
original O
battery O
lasted O
longer O
than O
this O
replacement O
. O

Many O
hotel O
rooms O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
free O
electrical O
outlets O
in O
convenient O
places O
for O
all O
the O
electronic O
devices O
we O
take O
when O
we O
travel O
. O

As O
a O
travel O
accessory O
, O
I O
absolutely O
recommend O
this O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
case O
thinking O
I O
would O
get O
the O
same O
thing O
for O
my O
new O
13&#34 O
; O

I O
also O
would O
n't O
expect O
anything O
larger O
than O
a O
15&#34 O
; O
display O
to O
fit O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
after O
- O
market O
battery O
I O
've O
bought O
for O
my O
Dell O
. O

it O

Very O
stange O

in O

( O
See O
my O
other O
reviews O
to O
see O
which O
antenna O

works O
for O
me.)Dec O

: O

I O
then O
bought O
a O
Samsonite O
( O
Tectonic O
Large O
) O
which O
is O
a O
more O
sober O
black O
but O
to O
be O
honest O

I O
had O
considered O
extending O
AppleCare O
but O
figured O
eh- O

I O
have O
read O
that O
there O
is O
also O
a O
lag O
from O
the O
source O
. O

so O
I O
gave O
up O
and O
just O
used O
VGA O
instead O
. O

Loved O
the O
look O
of O
it O
( O
does O
n't O
affect O
how O
it O
works O
though O
) O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
purchased O
this O
cute O
, O
sturdy O
, O
little O
piece O
of O
jewel O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
using O
an O
Amazon O
Basics O
silicone O
case O
that O
only O
covers O
the O
back O
of O
the O
iPad O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
do O
heavy O
word O
processing O
, O
then O
you O
will O
need O
a O
USB O
keyboard- O

I O
can O
deal O
with O
4 O
GB O
RAM O
( O
balances O
out O
with O
the O
other O
fixed O
specs O
like O
CPU O
) O
. O

I O
have O
the O
Extensa O
5420 O
and O
it O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

These O
speakers O
are O
just O
OK O
. O

a O
cooling O
fan O
is O
a O
far O
better O
design O
, O
even O
if O
the O
cooler O
running O
CPU O
is O
somewhat O
less O
powerful O
. O

I O
normally O
type O
at O
70 O
wpm O
, O
and O
find O
that O
the O
keyboard O
behaves O
reliably O
up O
to O
about O
35 O
wpm O
, O
then O
starts O
jamming O
or O
skipping O
letters O
beyond O
that O
point O
. O

Performance O
seems O
good O
and O

I O
use O
this O
for O
software O
development O
. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
eliminate O
my O
wired O
headphones O
for O
music O
AND O
my O
USB O
Jabra O
headset O
for O
phone O
calls O
, O
I O
went O
looking O
for O
a O
wireless O
solution O
. O

I O
travel O
quite O
often O
. O

great O
bag O
for O
my O
new O
samsung O
net O
- O
book O
. O
holds O
net O
- O
book O
securely O
and O
has O
a O
neat O
pocket O
for O
my O
mouse O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
paid O
to O
have O
fixed O
. O

Depending O
on O
your O
needs O
there O
are O
some O
redeeming O
qualities O
to O
this O
case O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
32 O
G O
USB O
to O
move O
data O
for O
work O
and O
home O
. O

It&#8217;s O
actually O
faster O
than O
that O
. O

: O
I O
only O
have O
to O
attach O
a O
single O
Thunderbolt O
cable O
and O
power O
cable O
to O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
when O
I O
come O
in O
every O
morning O
, O
and O
all O
of O
my O
peripherals O
are O
set O
up O
. O

Okay O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
speaker O
on O
June O
8 O
for O
$ O
59 O
. O

Small O
enough O
to O
be O
used O
as O
a O
" O
personal O
item O
" O
on O
board O
means O
obviously O
it O
's O
not O
big O
enough O
to O
hold O
a O
few O
clothes O
, O
and O
be O
a O
full O
carry O
on O
, O
but O
the O
attached O
back O
strap O
secured O
in O
the O
middle O
by O
Velcro O
when O
not O
in O
use O
, O
makes O
slipping O
it O
over O
the O
handle O
on O
your O
roll O
on O
luggage O
easy O
and O
convenient O
. O

It O
does O
let O
things O
stick O
to O
it O
like O
lent O
, O
dust O
, O
hair O
particles O
, O
and O
anything O
like O
that O
. O

Autofocus O
worked O
perfectly O
, O
and O
the O
camera O
changed O
focus O
quickly O
from O
" O
talking O
head O
" O
to O
" O
full O
room."I O
called O
Optia O
and O
talked O
with O
their O
tech O
support O
fellow O
, O
Enoch O
, O
before O
I O
made O
the O
purchase O
. O

I O
tried O
several O
( O
Accudio O
, O
Stella O
, O
Equalizer O
) O
, O
but O
Bongiovi O
beat O
them O
all O
hands O
down O
. O

but O
I O
could O
n't O
use O
them O
for O
listening O
to O
my O
favorite O
music O
while O
traveling O
or O
relaxing O
at O
home O
. O

My O
friend O
's O
laptop O
was O
randomly O
powering O
off O
and O
would O
only O
randomly O
power O
on O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
'll O
think O
twice O
before O
ordering O
anything O
from O
Asus O
again O
, O
including O
motherboards O
and O
tablets O
like O
the O
eee O

I O
was O
about O
to O
order O
for O

The O
battery O
lasts O
about O
one O
hour O
, O
which O
is O
OK O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
it O
's O
very O
well O
made O
, O
sturdy O
, O
and O
comfortable O
. O

Loved O
the O
sound O
, O
but O
was O
not O
sure O
if O
the O
Creature O
IIIs O
would O
be O
as O
good O
. O

The O
battery O
has O
lasted O
much O
longer O
than O
the O
old O
one O
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

DisplayLink O
, O
which O
provides O
the O
drivers O
for O
this O
device O
, O
is O
good O
about O
doing O
regular O
updates O
. O

the O
fan O
is O
fairly O
quiet O
indeed O
. O

Further O
, O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
product O
is O
ergonomically O
pleasing O
. O

No O
problem O
working O
with O
the O
Nikon O
D80 O
. O

You O
ca O
nt O
notice O
it O
which O
I O
like O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
iPad O
software O
issue O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
after O
searching O
in O
the O
forum O
, O
I O
realise O
this O
is O
a O
design O
issue4 O
. O

The O
sub O
woofer O
is O
marginal O
at O
best O
and O
does O
not O
provide O
any O
sort O
of O
base O
. O

The O
best O
one O
can O
say O
is O
& O
# O
34;it O
works O

Should O
be O
solid O
amber O
and O
then O
solid O
green O
when O
fully O
charged O
. O

It O
's O
so O
strong O
that O
I O
doubt O
you O
can O
break O
it O
without O
a O
hammer O
or O
similar O
type O
of O
tool O
. O

I O
can O
honestly O
say O
the O
ONLY O
thing O
I O
like O
better O
on O
the O
PC O
is O
how O
you O
can O
Explore O
for O
files O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
that O
I O
dislike O
about O
the O
bag O
. O

The O
picture O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
has O
the O
same O
charge O
life O
as O
the O
original O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
adequate O
for O
normal O
requirements O
. O

Had O
one O
of O
these O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

Immediately O
upon O
attaching O
the O
ethernet O
cables O
, O
I O
had O
an O
internet O
connection O
and O
was O
connected O
to O
my O
network O
. O

Being O
able O
to O
purchase O
this O
case O
for O
my O
new O
ipad O
is O
great O
. O

They O
have O
various O
sizes O
available O
for O
the O
different O
Macbook O
power O
adapters O
, O
so O
make O
sure O
to O
confirm O
your O
size O
before O
you O
order O
. O

I O
like O
it O
not O
because O
my O
PC O
lacks O
USB O
connections O
, O
but O
because O
I O
can O
disconnect O
all O
of O
my O
Aux O
. O

Two O
thumbs O
up O
from O
someone O
who O
just O
wanted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
communicate O
with O
friends O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
fine O
product O
! O

Shipping O
was O
fast O
and O
cable O
is O
very O
durable O
. O

Netflix O
and O
HBOgo O
work O
fine O
without O
noticeable O
drops O
, O
jumps O
or O
sync O
issues O
. O

Works O
well O
to O
carry O
around O
my O
filters O
, O
even O
the O
large O
ones O
, O
and O
protects O
them O
from O
getting O
scratched O
. O

Design O
is O
underplayed O
in O
this O
market O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
important O
! O

So O
I O
tried O
it O
again O
the O
next O
day O
, O
just O
using O
my O
Iphone O
via O
Bluetooth O
. O

and O
then O
it O
runs O
slowly O
because O
of O
memory O
size O
. O

For O
the O
price O
the O
camera O
and O
microphone O
work O
fine O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
others O
that O
one O
major O
drawback O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
padding O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

On O
high O
it O
is O
a O
little O
loud O
, O
but O
not O
overbearing O
. O

The O
true O
HD O
display O
, O
the O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
player O
, O
the O
backlit O
keyboard O
, O
1 O
TB O
Hard O
Drive O
, O
8 O
GB O
RAM O
, O
and O
the O
sleek O
design O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
sure O
what O
search O
term O
to O
use O
, O
and O
if O
I O
had O
to O
do O
it O
over O
again O

I O
have O
the O
16 O
" O
model O
and O
probably O
would O
have O
found O
the O
17 O
" O
size O
easier O
to O
use O
. O

The O
results O
look O
great O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
for O
similar O
purpose O
and O
similar O
size O
then O
I O
would O
suggestMicrosoft O

It O
seems O
sturdy O
and O
does O
what O
it O
says O
. O

1 O
Firewire O

, O
2 O

Stereo O

and O

Ca O
n't O
say O
that O
I O
really O
go O
for O
the O
bright O
blue O
light O
on O
top O
, O
but O
other O
than O
that O
... O

I O
have O
a O
few O
other O
laptop O
case O
that O
is O
just O
as O
good O
as O
this O
one O
yet O
priced O
at O
least O
30 O
% O
less O
. O

the O
connecting O
should O
be O
longer O
. O

However O
, O
the O
product O
was O
a O
nice O
surprise O
. O

Thule O
's O
sleeve O
is O
engineered O
with O
the O
same O
waffle O
design O
seen O
in O
its O
bike O
and O
cargo O
racks O
for O
good O
shock O
resistance O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
price O
on O
this O
baby O
is O
steep O
. O

I O
do O
recommend O
watching O
the O
video O
review O
by O
the O
guy O
on O
here O
as O
it O
clues O
you O
in O
on O
how O
to O
operate O
it O
. O

Note O
that O
this O
adapter O
supports O
2 O
. O

Easy O
setup O
and O
works O
great O
! O

even O

Very O
good O
price O

along O
with O
the O

I O
can O

Normal O

: O

This O
a O
very O
practical O
, O
great O
looking O
, O
comfortable O
and O
affordable O
bag O
. O

I O
called O
Apple O
and O
they O
said O
the O
generic O
cord O
should O
be O
fine O
, O
but O
since O
I O
still O
have O
AppleCare O
they O
are O
sending O
me O
an O
extra O
Apple O
power O
cord O
for O
free O
. O

I O
definitely O
would O
NOT O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

Irony O
, O
lol O
. O

Also O
, O
turning O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
prongs O
is O
far O
more O
difficult O
than O
it O
should O
be O
. O

The O
sound O
overall O
is O
better O
than O
I O
would O
expect O
from O
speakers O
this O
small O
, O
but O
I O
was O
also O
looking O
for O
just O
a O
slight O
step O
down O
in O
bass O
, O
and O
this O
was O
like O
two O
steps O
down O
. O

Over O
Packaged O

in O
plastic O
box O
containing O
the O
mouse O
protected O
in O
a O
plastic O
tray O
with O
a O
cardboard O
insert O
, O
but O
at O
least O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
" O
clam O
shell O
" O
to O
cut O
openThis O
is O
not O
really O
a O
great O
option O
for O
a O
desk O
mouse O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
while O
traveling O
or O
occasional O
use O
. O

I O
opened O
it O
up O
and O
Googgled O
the O
battery O
# O

and O
it O
only O
showed O
up O
on O
the O

I O
wanted O
this O

my O
3 O

A O

ILLUMINATION O

My O
friend O
has O
the O
exact O
same O
laptop O
as O
me O
and O
she O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
product O
does O
a O
fine O
job- O

Why O
does O
n't O
the O
Apple O
Corp O
carry O
this O
item O
. O

they O
keep O
their O
word O
. O

Well O
, O
my O
impressions O
of O
this O
laptop O
have O
again O
returned O
to O
a O
much O
more O
positive O
level O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
after O
several O
recent O
software O
updates O
of O
the O
Chrome O
OS O
, O
my O
physical O
keyboard O
issues O
had O
seemingly O
disappeared O
. O

It O
plugs O
into O
the O
wall O
outlet O
firmly O
. O

You O
also O
have O
a O
network O
scan O
tab O
to O
quickly O
search O
for O
different O
networks O
. O

and O
I O
must O
say O
I O
spent O
a O
few O
minutes O
admiring O
all O
the O
features O
. O

My O
trackpad O
cover O
had O
wrinkles O
on O
it O

The O
HP O
Chromebook O
14 O
displays O
rock O
- O
solid O
video O
and O
audio O
with O
no O
glitches O
. O

Not O
perfect O
over O
the O
water O
but O
close O
! O

The O
50 O
, O
000:1 O
Dynamic O
contrast O
as O
you O
know O
is O
not O
the O
real O
contrast O
ratio O
. O

It O
fits O
great O
and O
looks O
great O
too O
. O

Overall O
: O
If O
you O
want O
a O
super O
portable O
and O
very O
stylish O
laptop O
, O
you O
're O
comfortable O
working O
in O
the O
google O
environment O
of O
web O
apps O
, O
you O
have O
ready O
access O
to O
wi O
- O
fi O
, O
and O
you O
're O
on O
a O
budget O

The O
rip O
- O
stop O
fabric O
is O
sturdy O
with O
a O
checkered O
weave O
on O
accent O
pieces O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
sync O
my O
iPod O
or O
( O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
) O
any O
other O
media O
player O
. O

Sadly O
it O
's O
almost O
twice O
the O
price O
, O
but O
it O
's O
the O
only O
other O
alternative O
that O
has O
decent O
reviews.- O
Replacing O
your O
own O
RAM O
does O
NOT O
void O
the O
warranty O
or O
the O
Apple O
Care O
that O
covers O
your O
MacBook O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
headphones O
because O
they O
sound O
great O
with O
my O
phone O
, O
so O
maybe O
I O
got O
a O
bad O
one O
or O
maybe O
this O
brand O
does O
n't O
deliver O
quality O
signal O
and O
sound O
. O

I O
will O
update O
accordingly O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
Acer O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
and O
it O
is O
my O
primary O
computer O
( O
also O
own O
a O
Fujitsu O
Netbook O
and O
an O
ASUS O
Transformer O
Eee O
pad O
. O
) O

This O
one O
has O
plenty O
of O
padding O
to O
protect O
the O
unit O
and O
keep O
the O
screen O
from O
getting O
scratched O
. O

Good O
things O
about O
this O
system O
: O

I O
tried O
to O
install O
the O
adapter O
into O
my O
USB O
hub O
but O
my O
hub O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
power O
to O
run O
it O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
they O
do O
actually O
support O
their O
products O
and O
that O
the O
community O
is O
active O
in O
finding O
fixes O
. O

Online O
tech O
support O
is O
incredible O
! O

This O
is O
a O
definite O
Mac O
win O
. O

This O
has O
been O
my O
first O
experience O
with O
a O
screen O
protector O
.. O

The O
little O
card O
says O
" O
Protect O
headphone O
jack O
from O
liquids O
" O
. O

Obviously O
, O
there O
are O
audio O
driver O
issues O
that O
should O
have O
been O
defined O
in O
the O
product O
description O
. O

Just O
to O
give O
you O
one O
other O
example O
I O
once O
purchased O
a O
Dell O
desktop O
and O
a O
Dell O
printer O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
have O
to O
keep O
it O
. O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
. O

The O
service O
on O
this O
item O
was O
outstanding O
. O

So O
, O
I O
took O
it O
out O
, O
rinsed O
it O
under O
the O
tap O
and O
left O
it O
to O
dry O
2 O
days O

He O
tells O
me O
it O
works O
fine O
too O
. O

The O
unit O
is O
strong O
and O
the O
connection O
to O
male O
USB O
is O
very O
positive O
and O
reassuring O
. O

Working O
well O
enough O
so O
far O
. O

Under O
heavy O
use O

updating O
the O
laptop O
, O
running O
a O
virus O
scan O
, O
playing O

games O
, O
etc O
. O
) O

I O
actually O
found O
out O
about O
this O
one O
from O
an O
ad O
from O
Newegg O
, O
but O
found O
a O
better O
deal O
here O
on O
Amazon O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
each O
dumped O
the O
HP O
laptops O
and O
moved O
to O
Apple O
Workbooks O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
much O
there O
is O
to O
say O
about O
this O
. O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
a O
full O
frame O
camera O
griped O
a O
couple O
of O
lenses O
a O
flash O
and O
some O
small O
items O
as O
well O
. O

and O
protect O
the O
tablets O
from O
damage O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
so O
spacious O
and O
full O
of O
pockets O
, O
you O
may O
want O
one O
even O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
a O
laptop O
. O

There O
are O
also O
indentations O
to O
hold O
the O
thumb O
and O
pinky O
, O
which O
stop O
them O
from O
just O
hanging O
. O

The O
laptop O
compartment O
is O
excellent O
for O
a O
reflector O
. O

I O
was O
amazed O
again O
at O
the O
level O
of O
quality O
this O
had O
. O

Setup O
was O
easy O
. O

If O
the O
setup O
did O
n't O
require O
the O
technical O
ability O
I O
would O
have O
given O
the O
Catcher O
five O
stars O
. O

Sometimes O
running O
a O
live O
wallpaper O
can O
make O
the O
honeycomb O
desktop O
user O
interface O
run O
a O
little O
choppy O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
that O
bad O
. O

I O
have O
been O
moving O
it O
from O
my O
kitchen O
to O
my O
garden O
each O
day O
. O

The O
sound O
outputs O
seem O
to O
work O
fine O
, O
but O
the O
mic O
input O
is O
a O
waste O
of O
space O
and O
money O
. O

Apparently O
I O
'd O
been O
tossing O
it O
around O
a O
bit O
TOO O
casually O
and O
may O
have O
caused O
this O
, O
but O
it O
's O
fixed O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
bumpted O
it O
snapped O
apart O
. O

Wifi O
adapter O
amazing O
. O

You O
can O
NOT O
beat O
the O
price O
for O
this O
quality O
. O

WITH O
THIS O
IS O
THE O
WAY O
BETTER O
CHOICE O
WETHER O

I O
was O
able O
to O
recycle O
the O
old O
, O
used O
one O
at O
Staples O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
I O
made O
a O
good O
purchase O

so O
I O
can O
keep O
the O
keys O
clean O
. O

Highly O
recommend.[Sample O
provided O

and O
it O
's O
still O
handling O
the O
" O
next O

" O
games O
like O
a O
champ O
. O

There O
are O
many O
other O
reasons O
to O
go O
with O
the O
Compaq O
( O
big O
noticeable O
difference O
in O
speed O
, O
more O
memory O
, O
all O
for O
the O
same O
price O
) O
, O
but O
those O
were O
the O
two O
biggest O
things O
I O
personally O
enjoy O
about O
the O
Compaq O

It O
seems O
ok O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
with O
the O
recommended O

For O

the O

I O
think O
I O
've O
finally O
found O
my O
dream O
mouse O
. O

This O
adapter O
works O
well O
for O
the O
purpose O
that O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

2 O
months O
since O
the O
problems O
started O
... O
the O
battery O
is O
now O
dead O
. O

95 O
plus O
shipping O
. O

Had O
to O
turn O
it O
up O
and O
down O
a O
few O
times O
until O
it O
snapped O
right O
into O
place O
. O

Will O
work O
with O
almost O
anything O

days O
. O

She O
enjoyed O
' O
Penguins O
of O
Madagascar O
' O
and O
even O
used O
' O
Paint O
. O
' O

One O
other O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
is O
very O
simple O
to O
accidentally O
turn O
off O
the O
mouse O
if O
you O
are O
not O
careful O
. O

Lastly O
, O
it O
's O
sturdy O
and O
without O
gimmick O
. O

I O
have O
had O
Zero O
issues O
with O
this O
monitor O
over O
the O
time O
I O
have O
had O
it O

The O
4 O

again O
is O
almost O

for O
what O
the O

I O
have O

products O
and O
I O
have O
never O

Looks O
like O
a O
very O

, O
just O
like O
factory O
. O

Between O
the O
speakers O
and O
the O
audio O

, O
the O
sound O
is O
excellent O
. O

so O
you O
need O
to O
open O
it O
and O
remove O
the O
battery O
and O
place O
it O
again O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
protecting O
your O
GPS O
if O
you O
carry O
it O
in O
your O
purse O
or O
laptop O
bag O
rather O
than O
leaving O
it O
in O
the O
car O
. O

So O
you O
ca O
n't O
charge O
more O
than O
a O
single O
device O
in O
the O
hub O
at O
a O
time O
. O

This O
one O
will O
boost O
your O
music O
listening O
and O
gaming O
experience O
for O
little O
more O
than O
the O
price O
of O
a O
set O
of O

. O

The O
fit O
of O
the O
cover O
is O
great O
, O
but O
I O
have O
trouble O
with O
the O
Ctrl O
button O
in O
the O
bottom O
left O
corner O
. O

The O
one O
downside O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
OS O
install O
CD O

This O
little O
MacBook O
Pro O
feels O
new O
again O
. O

I O
ran O
the O
database O
management O
system O
like O
MySQL O
with O
pretty O
decent O
size O
data O
and O
did O
not O
notice O
any O
speed O
degradation O
compared O
with O
the O
octa O
- O
core O
Xeon O
CPU O
desktop O
I O
use O
at O
work O
. O

Just O
so O
you O
know O
, O
I O
charged O
the O
battery O
out O
of O
the O
box O
for O
over O
18 O
hours O
and O
I O
ran O
the O
battery O
down O
on O
every O
cycle O
for O
4 O
weeks O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
pleasedwith O
this O
Laptop O
. O

No O
matter O
what O
the O
CPU O
speed O
is O
the O
bottleneck O
with O
most O
laptops O
is O
the O
slow O
hard O
drive O
, O
but O
here O
is O
how O
you O
can O
make O
it O
faster O
by O
switching O
to O
SSD O
: O

My O
one O
complaint O
is O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
magnet O
to O
hold O
the O
cover O
shut O
. O

so O
i O
m O
glad O
i O
can O
protect O
it O
) O

The O
portability O
is O
awesome O
. O

The O
only O
negative O
point O
is O
that O
the O
adapter O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
rubber O
strip O
to O
hold O
the O
cable O

This O
power O
adapter O
was O
just O
the O
thing O
I O
needed O
after O
the O
Apple O
adapter O
fizzled O
out O
-- O
the O
cord O
frayed O
and O
the O
connection O
was O
loose O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
receiver O
is O
only O
as O
good O
as O
the O
reception O
in O
the O
area O
you O
are O
using O
it O
in O
. O

Some O
reviewers O
say O
that O
they O
smear O
dirt O
. O

What O
genius O
spec'd O
these O
fans O
? O
! O

, O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
use O
said O
software O
to O
mark O
devices O
as O
" O
trusted O
" O
, O
so O
they O
'll O
auto O
- O
connect O
on O
launch.)It O
's O
great O
how O
small O
this O
is O
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
skeptical O
because O
of O
the O
low O
price O
, O
but O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
since O
they O
were O
mostly O
positive O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
try O
. O

Turns O
out O
while O
the O
SDHC O
card O
looks O
the O
same O
as O
an O
SD O
card O
it O
's O
technically O
very O
different O
. O

Bluetooth/ O
DVI O
multi O
- O
display O
are O
plus O
. O

Cons O
: O
no O
plug O
, O
buttons O
would O
be O
better O
placed O
on O
the O
top O
. O

Great O
item O
, O
and O
Iove O
that O
you O
can O
rotate O
it O
around O
to O
suit O
where O
you O
want O
to O
plug O
it O
in O
. O

No O
need O
to O
blame O
that O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

these O
cloths O
pick O
it O
up O
like O
it O
's O
nothing O
. O

At O
this O
price O
I O
figured O
it O
could O
not O
hurt O
. O

This O
bag O
can O
hold O
a O
lot O
and O
everything O
you O
put O
in O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
. O

Use O
an O
external O

environment O
and O
rarely O
left O
docking O
station O
. O

I O
have O
bought O
other O
products O
from O
here O
before O
and O
has O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
them O
. O

This O
drive O
's O
cap O
tightly O
fits O
onto O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
stick O
if O
the O
drive O
is O
not O
on O
a O
leash O
or O
keyring O
. O

I O
will O
get O
more O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Wo O
n't O
use O
the O
suction O
cup O
. O

It O
works O
as O
advertised O
with O
my O
Blackberry O
. O

The O
good O
: O
The O
sound O
quality O
is O
considerably O
better O
than O
what O
you O
'd O
get O
with O
a O
typical O
dongle O
- O
style O
USB O
sound O
card O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
it O
worked O
well O
until O
I O
turned O
it O
off O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
got O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
so O
she O
could O
easily O
listen O
to O
her O
phone O
while O
in O
the O
tub O
or O
while O
doing O
various O
chores O
around O
the O
house O
. O

Tech O
people O
told O
me O
my O
laptop O
was O
useless O
but O
hated O
my O
new O
laptop O
so O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

built O
in O
usb O
port O
is O
ingenious O
, O
no O
need O
to O
carry O
around O
a O
separate O
cable O
. O

so O
I O
can O
leave O
the O
house O
and O
expect O
it O
to O
work O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
did O
have O
a O
question O
about O
uninstalling O
internal O
LAN O
card O
in O
computer O
that O
usually O
gave O
me O
fair O
connection O
to O
my O
router O
. O

I O
have O
pretty O
much O
maxed O
out O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
carry O
a O
bigger O
or O
heavier O
bag O
every O
day O
either O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
get O
a O
much O
cheaper O
card O
in O
this O
size O
or O
quality O
. O

I O
would O
have O
to O
un O
- O
plug O
and O
re O
- O
plug O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
this O
just O
absolutely O
refuses O
to O
pair O
with O
the O
phone O
. O

Cheap O
components O
. O

For O
basic O
home O
or O
office O
use O
, O
and O
most O
gaming O
, O
this O
processor O
will O
serve O
you O
very O
well O
. O

the O
software O
is O
so O
limited O
it O
only O
restores O
one O
file O
at O
a O
time O

Rubber O
pads O
on O
the O
body O
of O
the O
unit O
lineup O
perfectly O
with O
the O
feet O
on O
my O
notebook O
and O
there O
is O
absolutely O
no O
slipping O
or O
sliding O
around O
. O

The O
construction O
of O
the O
cable O
is O
good O
, O
of O
similar O
quality O
to O
the O
one O
it O
replaced O
. O

We O
then O
installed O
the O
Actiontec O
Wireless O
Network O
Adapter O
on O
his O
computer O

Good O
for O
convenient O
listening O
, O
not O
for O
playing O
DJ O
. O

but O
I O
can O
not O
download O
software O
. O

The O
DVD O
drive O
reads O
and O
burns O
CDs O
and O
DVDs O
effortlessy O
. O

First O
issue O
, O
which O
is O
a O
major O
one O
, O
is O
the O
WiFi O
... O
it O
likes O
to O
drop O
connection O
every O
few O
minutes O
from O
my O
home O
network O
. O

I O
think O
Slingmedia O
has O
a O
long O
career O
ahead O
of O
them O
. O

And O
with O
all O
that O
in O
the O
case O
there O
's O
room O
for O
a O
cell O

and/or O
a O

from O
the O

" O
laptop O
was O
put O
to O
use O
in O
anineo O

However O
there O
are O
several O
issue O

But O
hard O
drives O
go O
bad O
. O

some O
have O
argued O
that O
this O
acer O
is O
basic O
and O
plain O
, O
even O
boring O
. O

Selected O
this O
model O
because O
of O
the O
slightly O
bigger O
hard O
drive O
640 O
, O
USB O
3 O
ports O
and O
still O
has O
a O
dvd O
read O
/ O
write O
drive O
. O

Usually O
hard O
disk O
enclosures O
are O
bulky O
and O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
good O
design O
. O

I O
did O
fix O
it O
by O
putting O
in O
an O
oversized O
screw O
. O

Got O
this O
a O
while O
ago O

No O
issues O
at O
all O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
sold O
laptop O
so O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
its O
working O
now O
. O

I O
use O
it O
for O
word O
processing O
( O
I O
loaded O
office O
XP O

A O
followup O
email O
provided O
a O
no O
- O

The O
connectors O
are O
of O
premium O
material O
, O
the O
length O
is O
convenient O
and O
the O
cable O
is O
of O
good O
flexible O
quality O
. O

Frankly O
I O
'm O
quite O
amazed O
that O
such O
a O
long O
lasting O
battery O
costs O
so O
little O
. O

but O
I O
decided O
that O
it O
is O
better O
to O
acquire O
this O
repair O
products O
in O
my O
country O
so O
I O
can O
change O
them O
when O
this O
situations O
h&aacute;ppens O
. O

I O
was O
running O
the O
notebook O
on O
a O
desk O
, O
so O
blocked O
ventillation O
ports O
were O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
I O
came O
here O
to O
the O
reviews O
and O
found O
the O
correct O
way O
to O
pair O
by O
another O
reviewer O
. O

UV O
Glass O
Filter O
, O

It O
is O
rather O
heavy O
, O
especially O
compared O
to O
other O
keyboards O
such O
as O
the O
Logitech O
ultra O
- O
thin O
, O
but O
arguably O
these O
keyboards O
do O
n't O
have O
cases O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
it O
was O
seven O
bucks O
well O
spent O
. O

and O
they O
work O
great O
. O

You O
get O
choppy O
frames O
when O
watching O
a O
movie O
on O
Netflix O
- O
even O
a O
black O
- O
and O
- O
white O
non O
- O
HD O
one O
. O

For O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bargain O
for O
an O
N O
router O
. O

well O
made O
bag O
, O
as O
i O
would O
expect O
from O
Lowepro O
bags*We O
thought O
out O
design O
features O
, O
with O
a O
place O
for O
most O
all O
of O
the O
camera O
gear O
I O
want O
to O
carry.*Pockets O

But O
all O
of O
them O
set O
wrong O
expectation O
and O
paying O
some O
price O
now O
. O

The O
unit O
itself O
works O
well O
but O
the O
software O
and O
maps O
are O
way O
out O
of O
date O
. O

That O
said O
, O
it O
certainly O
sounds O
good O
enough O
to O
have O
some O
music O
going O
while O
hanging O
out O
with O
friends O
or O
when O
you O
need O
a O
little O
extra O
volume O
to O
watch O
a O
movie O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

I O
had O
to O
buy O
an O
Asus O
power O
adapter O
because O
and O
despite O
all O
of O
the O
comments O
stating O
that O
any O
matching O
voltage O
/ O
amperage O
base O
will O
work O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
. O

they O
're O
just O
a O
little O
harder O
to O
clean O
on O
these O
kind O
of O
surfaces O
. O

Downside O
is O
that O
the O
angle O
ca O
n't O
be O
adjusted O
. O

I O
would O
get O
it.*****_____UPDATE____*****After O
using O
this O
case O
for O
two O
days O

Got O
the O
Sandisk O
Extreme O
and O
it O
is O
excellent O
. O

Also O
the O
battery O
life O
has O
been O
pretty O
good O
to O
me O
- O
about O
5 O
hours O
of O
constant O
use O
to O
go O
from O
100 O
% O
to O
a O
dead O
battery O
. O

It O
will O
confuse O
customers O
. O

Still O
there O
is O
zigzag O
patterns O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
it O
does O
, O
indeed O
fit O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
can O
hear O
better O
from O
the O
speaker O
on O
my O
phone O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
an O
R9 O
290x O
to O
drive O
these O
, O
although O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
that O
if O
you O
cut O
gaming O
you O
could O
get O
by O
with O
much O
less O
GPU O
power O
. O

I O
started O
moving O
gigabytes O
worth O
of O
image O
and O
video O
files O
over O
a O
4 O
- O
5 O
day O
period O
to O
one O
of O
the O
drives O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
mine O
constantly O
for O
the O
past O
thirty O
days O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

It O
produces O
high O
quality O
DVDs O
and O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
discs O
, O
and O
it O
outputs O
HD O
directly O
to O
my O
1080p O
HD O
television O
through O
component O
and O
HDMI O
connections O
( O
the O
camera O
only O
outputs O
and O
records O
up O
to O
1080i O
though O
) O
. O

I O
just O
traded O
for O
this O
newest O
version O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
much O
care O
for O
the O
glossy O
screen O
because O
of O
glare O
that O
can O
appear O
in O
certain O
lighting O
conditions O
, O
but O
it O
does O
look O
good O
and O
many O
people O
swear O
these O
are O
better O
than O
matte O
screens O
. O

I O
use O
mine O
upside O
down O
- O
15 O
inch O
MBP O
on O
the O
17 O
inch O
side O
- O
because O
it O
protects O
any O
USB O
devices O
plugged O
into O
the O
sides O
. O

Batteries O
vs. O
USB O
: O
I O
tend O
to O
favor O
this O
as O
I O
only O
have O
my O
pad O
to O
draw O
from O
and O
it O
's O
one O
less O
charger O
and O
or O
cable,(USB O
) O
that O
I O
need O
to O
keep O
track O
of O
! O

It O
is O
true O
the O
outlet O
cord O
is O
short O
but O
do O
try O
to O
find O
a O
place O
for O
it O
because O
it O
will O
last O
if O
it O
's O
not O
moved O
a O
lot O
. O

no O
muss O
no O
fuss O
. O

The O
buttons O
are O
all O
laid O
out O
cleverly O
, O
and O
ergonomically O
, O
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
accidentally O
hit O
any O
of O
the O
extra O
buttons O
, O
all O
of O
which O
are O
perfectly O
responsive O
. O

So O
I O
saw O
this O
docking O
station O
and O
thought O
it O
'd O
be O
worth O
giving O
a O
try O
. O

This O
way O
i O
can O
pull O
there O
drive O
out O
of O
their O
PC O
and O
just O
hook O
it O
to O
my O
own O
computer O
to O
fix O
issues O
. O

Setup O
was O
faster O

They O
are O
a O
little O
thicker O
than O
the O
picture O
shows O
. O

Streaming O
video O
or O
thumb O
drive O
video O
works O
fine O
. O

With O
maybe O
1 O
cm O
to O
spare O
between O
the O
Mackbook O
and O
zipper O
. O

To O
think O
that O
I O
carried O
a O
64Kb O
( O
that O
's O
the O
optional O
additional O
memory O
) O
computer O
that O
then O
was O
state O
of O
the O
art O
compared O
to O
a O
320Gb O
monster O
that O
uses O
some O
of O
the O
best O
technology O
available O
. O

Works O
as O
prescribed O
. O

I O
was O
browsing O
the O
internet O
, O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
using O
the O
keyboard O
actively O
for O
a O
fair O
chunk O
of O
time O
... O
maybe O
10 O
minutes O
or O
so O
? O

I O
loved O
the O
idea O
and O
the O
features O
. O

( O
I O
know O
, O
I O
did O
it O
to O
my O
brother O
's O
G50VT O
) O
. O

I O
see O
varying O
reviews O
on O
the O
pre O
configd O
computer O
that O
was O
/ O
is O
sold O
at O
many O
chain O
stores O
and O
online O
last O
year O
and O
into O
earlier O
this O
year O
as O
new O
models O
of O
these O
are O
out O
that O
are O
faster O
and O
cheaper O
. O

I O
wish O
the O
blue O
lights O
were O
not O
so O
bright O
( O
it O
lights O
the O
room O
at O
night O
, O
but O
a O
piece O
of O
cardboard O
will O
fix O
that O
) O
. O

These O
are O
none O
of O
those O
things O
. O

If O
you O
are O
planned O
to O
use O
it O
for O
heavy O
load O
of O
work O
, O
you O
should O
n't O
use O
this O
case O
because O
it O
's O
going O
to O
heat O
up O
really O
easily O
. O

I O
'm O
out O
whatever O
the O
cost O
was O
, O
and O
have O
a O
junk O
battery O
for O
my O
trouble O
. O

I O
had O
abandoned O
it O
completely O
. O

Overall O
a O
very O
good O
case O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
for O
anyone O
looking O
to O
fit O
an O
11 O
. O

The O
subwoofer O
could O
be O
louder O
, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
bass O
booster O
plus O
another O
subwoofer O
so O
its O
sounds O
very O
nice O
. O

I O
use O
this O
for O
taking O
notes O
in O
class O
, O
so O
I O
keep O
it O
clean O
and O
not O
junked O
up O
. O

I O
got O
the O
M505 O
in O
black O
and O
to O
my O
surprise O
it O
matches O
with O
the O
keyboard O
. O

The O
right O
side O
has O
a O
door O
that O
covers O
the O
memory O
slot O
and O
the O
headphone O
jack O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
it O
was O
jittery O
enough O
that O
watching O
TV O
was O
painful O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
concept O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
manufacture O
is O
not O
what O
heavy O
users O
need O
. O

This O
uses O
a O
unique O
octagonal O
connector O
which O
is O
a O
royal O
pain O
because O
no O
one O
else O
really O
uses O
this O
shape O
. O

Again O
, O
we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
hook O
them O
up O
to O
the O
LCD O
television O
. O

Con:- O

. O

he O
had O
his O
motherboard O
replaced O
. O

Only O
1 O
month O
in O
, O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
the O
bag O
will O
last O
me O
a O
while.- O
Very O
comfortable O
. O

The O
one O
pictured O
on O
Amazon O
does O
not O
show O
the O
sleeve O
so O
it O
may O
or O
may O
not O
have O
it O
( O
although O
one O
reviewer O
claims O
that O
it O
does O
) O
. O

The O
grip O
pads O
hold O
the O
laptop O
in O
place O
, O
and O
make O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
comfortable O
to O
use O
on O
my O
lap O
as O
well O
. O

The O
Vaio O
is O
less O
than O
8 O
" O
deep O
whereas O
the O
case O
is O
at O
least O
9 O
" O
deep O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
webcam O
with O
built O
in O
mic O
with O
superior O
video O
for O
Skype O
. O

It O
is O
holding O
up O
well O
and O
has O
become O
my O
" O
carry O
on O
" O
on O
all O
air O
trips O
. O

I O
was O
really O
bored O
with O
Windows O
7 O
and O
wanted O
something O
new O
, O
but O
I O
could O
n't O
justify O
spending O
thousands O
of O
dollars O
for O
a O
laptop O
with O
specs O
I O
could O
never O
upgrade O
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
having O
to O
repurchase O
software O
I O
have O
that O
can O
only O
run O
on O
Windows O
. O

This O
is O
a O
small O
bag O
. O

I O
will O
edit O
this O
comment O
after O
I O
get O
it O
and O
try O
it O
out O
. O

Awesome O
brand O
, O
good O
image O
, O
working O
as O
we O
expect O

I O
purchased O
this O
adapter O

The O
one O
in O
the O
photo O
has O
the O
grey O
pad O
in O
the O
corner O
that O
helps O
the O
laptop O
stay O
in O
place O
. O

For O
choosing O
this O
I O
had O
considered O
a O
product O
which O
had O
multiple O
connectivity O
options O
as O
I O
had O
a O
Yamaha O
receiver O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
replace O
the O
charger O
that O
stopped O
working O
previously O
, O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
fabulously O
since O
I O
received O
it O
. O

A O
detail O
I O
have O
never O
encountered O
, O
but O
loved O
immediately O
... O

I O
love O
all O
the O
numerous O
compartments O
especially O
the O
2 O
side O
pockets O
for O
my O
cell O
phone O
, O
reading O
glasses O
or O
sunglasses O
, O
very O
convenient O
and O
easily O
accessible O
. O

My O
daughter O
hit O
the O
ground O
running O
with O
the O
Chromebook O
os O
and O
did O
not O
require O
any O
training O
. O

It O
is O
like O
listening O
to O
a O
FM O
station O
that O
has O
poor O
reception O
. O

Just O
glad O
that O
it O
came O
with O
minimal O
bloatware O
. O

That O
is O
indicative O
of O
less O
cushioning O
than O
they O
should O
have O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
backpack O
case O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
came O
with O
more O
RAM O
, O
but O
that O
is O
an O
easy O
update O
. O

I O
would O
give O
these O
5 O
stars O
if O
performance O
were O
my O
only O
criteria O
, O
but O
I O
work O
a O
10-hour O
day O
and O
comfort O
is O
also O
a O
consideration O
. O

so O
it O
's O
clear O
Google O
is O
still O
tweaking O
Honeycomb O
. O

Battery O
works O
great O
in O
my O
Windows O
7 O
machine O
. O

Sorry O
just O
a O
one O
off O
bad O
product O
I O
received O
but O
irritating O
nonetheless O

There O
is O
plenty O
of O
space O
inside O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
pockets O
for O
pens O
, O
mp3player O
, O
cell O
phone O
, O
etc O
. O

If O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
than O
that O
I O
think O
I O
would O
however O
packaged O
it O
back O
up O
and O
would O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
mouse O
to O
replace O
one O
at O
work O
. O

I O
've O
been O
running O
this O
for O
at O
least O
3 O
hours O
now O
, O
and O
am O
typing O
in O
battery O
mode O
. O

Using O
Reaper O
DAW O
and O
everything O
is O
working O
fine O
. O

I O
have O
used O
this O
several O
times O
to O
track O
my O
run O
and O
biking O
routes O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
Lenovo O
dock O
. O

The O
back O
air O
vent O
is O
really O
kind O
of O
a O
" O
doh O
! O

You O
have O
to O
click O
the O
button O
on O
the O
USB O
key O
again O
and O

The O
mouse O
has O
quick O
re O
- O
spawns O
overall O
. O

For O
simple O
slim O
protection O
of O
a O
MBA O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
case O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
the O
adapter O
picked O
up O
less O
bars O
but O
it O
would O
not O
pick O
up O
all O
the O
access O
points O
that O
it O
orginally O
did O
. O

My O
laptop O
does O
fit O
in O
the O
compartment O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
tight O
fit O
- O
my O
iPad O
, O
though O
, O
fits O
perfectly O
. O

often O
the O
plug O
drops O
behind O
the O
dresser O
. O

I O
have O
been O
working O
on O
both O
my O
Dell O
Vista O
system O
and O
my O
Macbook O
and O
find O
the O
Macbook O
more O
user O
friendly O
and O
stable O
than O
the O
Dell O
Vista O
system O
. O

I O
'm O
ready O
to O
add O
ratings O
. O

For O
the O
first O
~12 O
months O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
what O
it O
is O
, O
but O
as O
time O
has O
past O
it O
has O
n't O
worked O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
a O
number O
of O
similar O
products O
to O
which O
I O
am O
comparing O
these O
because O
sound O
wise O
they O
are O
amazing O
. O

And O
it O
sits O
well O
on O
my O
lap O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
slide O
much O
. O

I O
bought O
two O
of O
these O
to O
keep O
to O
charge O
my O
LG O
Nexus O
4 O
, O
Asus O
Nexus O
7 O
, O
and O
Kindle O
Paper O
White O
. O

Downside O
is O
the O
power O
brick O
is O
clunky O
and O
clumsy O
, O
upside O
is O
the O
cord O
is O
much O
longer O
than O
the O
original O
power O
supply O
. O

Have O
not O
tried O
it O
yet O

Actually O
, O
they O
were O
there O
, O
but O
, O
on O
a O
reasily O
removable O
plastic O
film O
. O

I O
just O
put O
a O
piece O
of O
tape O
over O
it O
to O
hold O
it O
in O
place O
. O

The O
captions O
are O
presented O
in O
a O
goofy O
manner O
as O
well O
; O
there O
's O
too O
much O
kerning O
( O
letters O
are O
too O
far O
apart O
) O
within O
words O
. O

I O
have O
trouble O
keeping O
track O
of O
paper O
, O
so O
putting O
notes O
in O
a O
computer O
is O
much O
better O
for O
me O
. O

The O
battery O
has O
worked O
flawlessly O
for O
six O
weeks O
. O

The O
modules O
passed O
memtest O
with O
no O
problems O

I O
had O
no O
problem O
connecting O
my O
mouse O
to O
the O
HUB O
, O
or O
a O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O

This O
product O
was O
the O
least O
expensive O
option O
, O
but O
the O
quality O
was O
very O
good O
. O

Nice O
neoprene O
overstuffable O
zippered O
pouch O
on O
front O
is O
great O
for O
cables O
, O
charger O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
even O
a O
pocket O
inside O
the O
pouch O
for O
a O
flash O
drive O
. O

I O
picked O
this O
up O
for O
a O
ski O
trip O
so O
could O
keep O
my O
HTC O
Smartphone O
charged O
throughout O
the O
day O
+ O
Apre O
' O
and O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

USB O
port=500mA O
, O
this O
charger O
probably O
gives O
200 O
to O
300 O
mA. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
much O
of O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
Windows O
7 O
, O
and O
while O
this O
is O
n't O
a O
Windows O
7 O
review O
, O
it O
works O
smoothly O
on O
this O
machine O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
know O
the O
brightness O
is O
there O
, O
when O
needed O
. O

if O
your O
laptop O
or O
desktop O
got O
a O
hdmi O
plug O
- O
in O
and O
your O
monitor O
got O
a O
dvi O
connector O
, O
then O
this O
adapter O
cable O
is O
definitely O
for O
you O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
I O
'm O
disappointed O
and O
it O
was O
a O
mistake O
to O
get O
it O
. O

LOOKS O
GREAT O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
, O
like O
the O
other O
reviewers O
wrote O
, O
is O
the O
only O
power O
switch O
is O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
sub O
and O
not O
on O
the O
satellites O
. O

I O
am O
disappointed O
in O
the O
product O
. O

This O
film O
for O
my O
mac O
book O
pro O
13&#34 O
; O
is O
working O
good O

btw O
, O
you O
may O
need O
to O
upgrade O
the O
driver O
( O
I O
needed O
an O
HPIJS O
driver O
for O
my O
multi O
- O
function O
HP O
d145 O
) O
; O
the O
original O
driver O
did O
n't O
even O
install O
from O
the O
cd O

I O
could O
not O
be O
happier O
. O

but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
return O
the O
Deadpad O
today O
and O
got O
this O
nifty O
tablet O
instead O
. O

I O
use O
these O
to O
carry O
cables O
, O
mouse O
, O
etc O
. O

Heavily O
used O
Laptops O
that O
are O
on O
all O
the O
time O
should O
use O
a O
cooler O
running O
drive O
( O
slower O
rotational O
speeds O
) O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
connections O
. O

It O
may O
look O
the O
same O
, O
fit O
the O
same O
, O
but O
it O
may O
not O
have O
the O
power O
to O
run O
the O
machine O
. O

It O
's O
too O
bad O
that O
the O
case O
is O
n't O
selling O
for O
a O
penny O
more O

I O
was O
able O
to O
fit O
in O
extra O
batteries O
, O
chargers O
, O
mounts O
, O
small O
attachments O
etc O
. O

The O
one O
that O
wreaks O
utter O
HAVOK O
on O
most O
computers O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
really O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
the O
wireless O
signal O
or O
the O
computer O
, O
but O
figured O
at O
just O
$ O
20 O

What O
I O
also O
have O
is O
a O
small O
fan O
behind O
it O
driving O
more O
air O
into O
the O
& O
# O
34;intake&#34 O
; O
of O
the O
back O
. O

If O
your O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
HDTV O
go O
with O
the O
latest O
technology O
and O
buy O
a O
LCD O
. O

I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
extra O
long O
charge O
compared O
to O
the O
stock O
battery O
on O
an O
e1505 O
. O

The O
addition O
of O
the O
keyboard O
cover O
makes O
it O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
though O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
the O
Caps O
Lock O
light O
through O
it O
. O

While O
you O
're O
recording O
you O
can O
zoom O
in O
( O
digital O
) O
using O
the O
+ O
and O
- O
buttons O
. O

Connects O
with O
all O
my O
bluetooth O
products O
including O
my O
jambox O
and O
sound O
bar O
. O

I O
then O
checked O
the O
User O
Manual O
, O
page O
56 O
, O
and O
sure O
enough O
it O
says O
" O
The O
caption O
feature O
does O
n't O
work O
in O
Component O
, O
HDMI O
or O
PC O
modes O
. O

I O
have O
had O
this O
HDTV O
set O
for O
a O
few O
years O
and O
i O
absolutely O
love O
it O
. O

: O
) O
Still O
great O
for O
the O
price O
! O

Returning O
to O
Amazon O
. O

It O
has O
decent O
battery O
life O
, O
is O
not O
too O
heavy O
, O
and O
performance O
is O
rather O
better O
than O
Atom O
based O
netbooks O
I O
've O
used O
. O

ca O
n't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
. O

i O
like O
the O
texture O
on O
this O
case O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
pretty O
terrible O
, O
but O
this O
is O
essentially O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
so O
you O
would O
n't O
be O
moving O
it O
around O
much O
anyway O
. O

Marvelous O
clarity O
and O
tack O
- O
sharp O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
use O
it O
to O
travel O
. O

The O
adjustable O
focus O
is O
a O
plus O
, O
but O
image O
resolution O
is O
nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Works O
well O
and O
my O
daughter O
has O
not O
complained O
about O
it O
while O
playing O
League O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
than O
buying O
2x O
2 O
GB O
DIMMs O
, O
but O
this O
configuration O
gives O
me O
the O
option O
to O
add O
another O
2 O
GB O
in O
the O
future O
if O
needed O
. O

I O
'd O
definitely O
buy O
another O
! O

plus O
, O
it O
looks O
sweet O
with O
the O
red O
trim O
. O

I O
booted O
up O
in O
safe O
mode O
and O
I O
got O
it O
working O
by O
replacing O
the O
old O
version O
of O
Intel O
Rapid O
Storage O
Technology O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
my O
camera O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
lenses O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
flashes O
, O
some O
filters O
, O
and O
all O
the O
manuals O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
something O
slim O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
it O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
perfectly O
functional O
and O
I O
found O
out O
that O
it O
would O
cost O
around O
$ O
30 O
to O
buy O
the O
replacement O
fan O
for O
this O
specific O
model O
. O

Still O
a O
nice O
device O
, O
it O
helps O
the O
aesthetic O
quite O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
does O
n't O
do O
much O
to O
save O
space O
. O
if O
you O
have O
a O
full O
family O
, O
I O
suggest O
getting O
the O
10 O
port O
. O

The O
" O
insert O
" O
and O
" O
delete O
' O
key O
strokes O
have O
been O
combined O
so O
you O
get O
a O
" O
ctrl O
- O
alt O
- O
delete O
" O
instead O
. O

Still O
I O
get O
5 O
hours O
( O
not O
gaming O
) O
because O
the O
GPU O
is O
disabled O
and O
it O
uses O
the O
on O
board O
graphics O
of O
the O
i7 O
. O

The O
battery O
lasts O

Seats O
very O
well O
with O
a O
satisfying O
click O
into O
my O
dv7 O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
the O
2nd O
OTG O
adapter O
I O
bought O
from O
the O
other O
Amazon O
seller O
" O
Warm O
Mart O
" O
still O
has O
not O
arrived O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

an O
upgrade O
from O
my O
old O
thinkpad O
in O
every O
respect O
, O
though O
I O
think O
I O
prefer O
the O
screen O
dimensions O
of O
my O
old O
one O
. O

They O
do O
not O
provide O
a O
data O
path O
so O
you O
can O
not O
use O
them O
to O
copy O
or O
sync O
devices O
with O
your O
computer O
. O

If O
any O
of O
you O
all O
have O
just O
bought O
a O
new O
MacBook O
like O
I O
have O
, O
I O
know O
you O
're O
treating O
it O
like O
a O
newborn O
. O

Light O
weightActually O
feels O
feather O
light O
. O

Wireless O
Dual O
- O
Band O
Mini O
USB O
Adapter O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
install O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
CD O
Quick O
Installation O
Guide O
, O
Setup O
Wizard O
, O
and O
instruction O
manual O
. O

Maybe O
the O
expert O
Bike O
messengers O
of O
NYC O
do O
n't O
have O
this O
problem O
, O
but O
I O
could O
see O
this O
strap O
flailing O
about O
and O
snagging O
onto O
a O
vehicle O
or O
other O
object O
, O
and O
dragging O
the O
user O
onto O
the O
road O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
the O
idea O
this O
machine O
is O
really O
bulky O
; O
it O
's O
not O
. O

so O
I O
could O
play O
PC O
games O
on O
my O
TV O
without O
having O
to O
run O
a O
cable O
. O

Build O
quality O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
only O
exception O
is O
chintzy O
touchpad O
buttons O
, O
but O
it O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
deal O
breaker O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
access O
to O
my O
computer O
and O
the O
internet O
. O

they O
did O
send O
a O
second O
one O
, O
so O
I O
think O
if O
you O
always O
get O
two O
then O
it O
is O
probably O
worth O
it O
but O
for O
one O
. O

My O
major O
worry O
was O
that O
the O
new O
drive O
would O
be O
audible O
, O
but O
I O
quite O
honestly O
ca O
n't O
even O
hear O
it O
even O
when O
I O
put O
my O
ear O
to O
the O
PS4 O
. O

Dell O
inspiron O
Z O
especially O
with O
these O
specs O
for O
the O
price O
of O
$ O
600 O

The O
whole O
reason O
I O
bought O
this O
fan O
is O
because O
I O
had O
to O
replace O
a O
busted O
internal O
fan O
on O
a O
laptop O
once O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
again O
. O

All O
in O
all O
works O
wonders O
. O

The O
product O
was O
delivered O
a O
day O
before O
it O
was O
expected O
and O
this O
device O
delivers O
what O
the O
seller O
said O
it O
would O
. O

it O
's O
the O
laptop O
or O
not O
, O
but O
I O
have O
trouble O
connecting O
to O
the O
wifi O
at O
home O
and O
at O
Starbucks O
. O

The O
bass O
is O
okay O

I O
'd O
also O
suggest O
using O
an O
external O
keyboard O
/ O
mouse O
when O
possible O
, O
but O
the O
trackpad O
is O
surprisingly O
usable O
- O
just O
not O
for O
programming O
. O

I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
spending O
over O
$ O
100 O
! O

Simply O
put O
, O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

It O
is O
made O
of O
high O
quality O
material O
and O
zippers O
work O
really O
well O
. O

That O
one O
minor O
quibble O
aside O
though O
, O
I O
can O
confidently O
say O
I O
'll O
be O
using O
this O
bag O
for O
years O
to O
come O
. O

Hooked O
it O
up O
with O
my O
drives O
and O
it O
does O
NOT O
power O
up O
. O

Now O
, O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
browsing O
and O
word O
processing O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
few O
applications O
, O
you O
are O
limited O
to O
Google O
's O
applications O
. O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
have O
wifi O
, O
though O
when O
I O
used O
it O
sometimes O
it O
was O
sporadic O
( O
this O
could O
just O
be O
an O
issue O
with O
my O
university O
's O
wifi O
) O
. O

Very O
cool O
to O
charge O
my O
iPad O
and O
watch O
the O
blue O
streaming O
cord O
lights O
. O

i O
got O
a O
flash O

Plug O
and O
Display O
" O
text O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
and O
on O
the O
front O
is O
a O
Blue O
LED O
for O
power O
and O
Green O
LED O
for O
USB O
connection O
. O

The O
Canon O
bag O
has O
been O
with O
me O
on O
many O
domestic O
and O
international O
trips O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switched O
it O
out O
with O
my O
old O
, O
beefy O
wireless O
Logitec O
keyboard O
and O
mouse O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
use O
a O
universal O
adapter O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
voltage O
and O
current O
requirements O
for O
the O
iM7 O
are O
so O
high O
that O
the O
universal O
adapter O
overheats O
after O
1 O
hour O
of O
use O
. O

Just O
generic O
bluetooth O
radio O
in O
devices O
. O

I O
wish O
the O
user O
interface O
had O
more O
information O
. O

Cheaper O
than O
many O
others O
with O
less O
for O
your O
money O
. O

I O
also O
wish O
they O
allowed O
one O
to O
purchase O
a O
sleeveless O
drive O
, O
so O
the O
user O
can O
recycle O
old O
sleeves O
when O
upgrading O
a O
drive O
or O
purchasing O
extra O
sleeves O
. O

This O
replacement O
battery O
works O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
tried O
another O
blue O
tooth O
keyboard O
and O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
. O

I O
get O
5 O
- O
6 O
hours O
easily O
and O
with O
some O
& O
# O
34;management&#34 O
; O
I O
can O
stretch O
this O
to O
6 O
- O
7 O
hours O
. O

However O
if O
you O
are O
free O
of O
possible O
crushing O
situations O
this O
is O
a O
really O
nice O
, O
sleek O
and O
classy O
laptop O
case O
. O

excellent O
addition O
for O
anyone O
who O
has O
a O
laptop O
and O
mouse O
and O
needs O
a O
mouse O
pad O
and O
to O
keep O
the O
computer O
cool O
. O
great O
price O
too O
! O

stuff O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
trust O
to O
the O
tender O
mercies O
of O
the O
TSA O
/ O
airlines O
and O
wanted O
direct O
access O
to O
as O
I O
travelled O
. O

special O
Intel O
equipment O

Working O
it O
out O
by O
trial O
and O
error O
was O
annoying O
. O

I O
've O
sought O
them O
via O
Facebook O
and O
Email O
and O
all O
I O
get O
is O
the O
cold O
shoulder O
. O

The O
iPad O
will O
slip O
in O
nicely O
, O
making O
the O
most O
of O
space O
so O
you O
can O
actually O
see O
your O
screen O
. O

There O
are O
no O
shortcuts O
to O
BT O
on O
an O
iPhone O
. O

I O
even O
leave O
it O
on O
when O
I O
close O
my O
macbook O
pro O
lid O
and O
there O
is O
no O
gaps O
between O
keyboard O
and O
shell O
. O

Total O
of O
4 O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
ports O
functioned O
as O
follows:2 O
x O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
standard O
. O

I O
love O
Cooler O
Master O
products O
. O

And O
I O
set O
mine O
to O
shut O
down O
when O
the O
lid O
is O
shut O
. O

I O
have O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
trust O
New O
Trent O
to O
create O
a O
well O
- O
design O
and O
good O
- O
looking O
premium O
product O
and O
would O
recommend O
this O
without O
hesitation O
. O

My O
computer O
has O
not O
crashed O
once O
since O
I O
started O
using O
the O
cooling O
pad O
, O
and O
my O
CoreTemp O
values O
are O
still O
consistently O
much O
lower O
than O
they O
were O
without O
the O
cooling O
pad O
. O

DO O
NOT O
BUY O
THIS O
JUNK O
! O

Now O
, O
I O
do O
really O
like O
this O
laptop O
. O

Second O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
comfortable O
. O

Touching O
Screen O
with O
windows O
8 O
is O
an O
interesting O
experiences O
. O

First O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
the O
next O
best O
thing O
since O
sliced O
bread O
. O

PORTSJust O
the O
right O
number O
. O

No O
amount O
of O
asking O
it O
to O
reconnect O
would O
do O
. O

Nice O
thing O
though O
, O
the O
first O
one O
that O
got O
fried O
, O
SanDisk O
replaced O
it O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

/rw O
that O
takes O
the O
mini O
discs O
and O
the O
regular O
sized O
discs O
. O

The O
Nabi O
2 O
is O
essentially O
a O
rebadged O
Google O
Nexus O
7 O
( O
with O
a O
few O
hardware O
tweaks O
, O
like O
the O
HDMI O
out O
port O
) O
but O
tailored O
for O
children O
and O
has O
almost O
identical O
hardware O
specs O
to O
the O
Nexus O
7 O
, O
which O
is O
just O
dandy O
since O
the O
Nexus O
is O
a O
very O
versatile O
and O
fast O
tablet O
platform O
. O

and O
it O
takes O
another O
good O
1 O
- O
2 O
seconds O
for O
the O
keyboard O
to O
wake O
up O
again O
! O

The O
wifi O
is O
great O
and O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

There O
is O
a O
well O
documented O
issue O
with O
the O
" O
audio O
out O
" O
from O
the O
docking O
station O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
bag O
and O
has O
served O
me O
well O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
bag O
to O
friends O
, O
and O
would O
consider O
Kata O
for O
my O
next O
bag O
if O
I O
needed O
something O
else O
. O

HP O
Touchpad O
and O
Nexus O
7 O
2012 O
works O
great O
on O
it O
. O

So O
in O
conclusion O
give O
starter O
a O
chance O
, O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

A O
good O
one O
would O
be O
like O
putting O
a O
new O
kind O
of O
oil O
in O
your O
car O
.... O
one O
that O
says O
" O
more O
power O
and O
better O
mileage O

Cable O
and O
Wireless O
is O
an O
awful O
merchant O
, O
and O
Fulfillment O
by O
Amazon O
is O
terrible O
to O
ship O
this O
incorrect O
product O
for O
them O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
. O

They O
were O
always O
gorgeous O
, O
which O
is O
what O
drew O
me O
towards O
them O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
but O
whether O
it O
be O
trackpad O
or O
keyboard O
problems O
, O
there O
was O
always O
something O
that O
put O
them O
at O
looks O
great O
functions O
meh O
. O

The O
screen O
size O
was O
just O
right O
, O
and O
performance O
was O
great O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
toy O
I O
have O
ever O
bought O
. O

Google O
needed O
to O
think O
this O
through O
much O
as O
Amazon O
did O
the O
Kindle O
with O
its O
" O
free O
" O
3 O
G O
service O
. O

It O
runs O
Windows O
7 O
slower O
than O
my O
almost O
decade O
old O
Thinkpad O
T42 O
, O
despite O
having O
twice O
the O
processing O
cores O
and O
twice O
the O
memory O
as O
the O
T42 O
. O

This O
drive O
performance O
on O
HD O
Tach O
was O
equivalent O
to O
a O
RAID O
( O
0 O
) O
: O

the O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
is O
shut O
down O
and O
reboot O
. O

The O
DC O
power O
pin O
on O
the O
motherboard O
side O
has O
broken O
again O
and O
its O
at O
their O
facility O
waiting O
for O
a O
part O
before O
it O
can O
be O
repaired O
. O

it O
jumped O
to O
$ O
420 O
something O
then O
$ O
479 O
, O
$ O
500 O
plus O
, O
etc O
. O

Then O
... O
sound O
was O
an O
issue O
. O

Thinking O
of O
this O
bag O
really O
nothing O
bad O
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

I O
liked O
it O
so O
much O

I O
have O
somewhat O
sensitive O
eyes O
so O
glare O
is O
always O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

Totally O
happy O
with O
this O
item O
. O

The O
touchpad O
is O
bumpy O
and O
there O
's O
a O
smooth O
area O
to O
the O
right O
that O
will O
work O
for O
one O
finger O
scrolling O
. O

The O
plug O
end O
- O
rather O
than O
collapsing O
to O
take O
less O
room O
- O
turns O
so O
that O
you O
can O
maneuver O
it O
in O
three O
different O
directions O
to O
make O
room O
for O
other O
devices O
to O
use O
the O
remaining O
wall O
socket O
. O

Someone O
really O
thought O
out O
what O
a O
student O
/ O
commuter O
/ O
traveler O
really O
needs O
in O
a O
laptop O
ready O
pack O
. O

One O
week O
in O

I O
love O
this O
netbook O
. O
. O
. O

It O
was O
also O
at O
102 O
% O
capacity O
for O
some O
reason O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
defeating O
the O
whole O
purpose O
, O
does O
n't O
it O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
to O
use O
the O
protection O
plan O
yet O
but O
it O
seems O
easy O
enough O
to O
do O
if O
my O
device O
ever O
requires O
it O
. O

There O
's O
a O
setting O
on O
the O
desktop O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
change O
the O
automatic O
updates O
feature O
to O
just O
letting O
you O
know O
that O
there O
are O
updates O
available O
. O

1 O
Speakers O
which O
sound O
like O
they O
have O
a O
problem O
... O

So O
, O
this O
Cooler O
Master O
notepal O
x2 O
has O
been O
running O
almost O
1 O
. O
5 O
years O
99 O
% O
everyday O
and O
it O
still O
runs O
just O
like O
it O
had O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
ho O
got O
a O
better O
machine O
... O
me O
. O

These O
are O
the O
best O
tools O
for O
any O
photographer O
. O

It O
's O
been O
extremely O
reliable O
and O
without O
the O
bazillion O

I O
purchased O
this O
adapter O
in O
order O
to O
use O
a O
small O
CF O
card O
as O
a O
boot O
drive O
for O
a O
small O
NAS O
system O
. O

Spend O
the O
extra O
cash O
on O
this O
silverstone O
, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
most O
likely O
regret O
it O
. O

Exactly O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
to O
add O
to O
my O
laptop O
. O

At O
first O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
miss O
- O
clicking O
or O
something O

It O
has O
a O
fan O
on O
the O
unit O
for O
cooling O
but O
the O
fan O
is O
very O
quiet O
. O

four O
years O
total O
for O
that O
one O
- O
time O
price O
, O
which O
includes O
free O
Skype O
, O
and O
it O
also O
installed O
the O
whole O
Suite O
to O
my O
Smartphone O
at O
no O
additional O
cost- O
awesome O
! O
) O

I O
could O
see O
the O
unknown O
device O
in O
my O
device O
manager O
, O
but O
the O
driver O
would O
not O
load O
automatically O
. O

It O
looks O
great O
and O
it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
pockets O
for O
easy O
organization O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
for O
my O
mini O
lap O
top O
as O
I O
needed O
additional O
outlets O
. O

If O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
bigger O
, O
it O
would O
of O
been O
the O
perfect O
mouse O
for O
me O
. O

yes O
, O
the O
first O
battery O
was O
DOA O
... O
but O
dealing O
with O
this O
company O
's O
customer O
service O
was O
fantastic O
. O

It O
was O
not O
a O
USB O
cable O
. O

It O
just O
appeared O
too O
small O
. O

I O
love O
the O
case O
. O

It O
powers O
up O
my O
DVD O
, O
works O
well O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

Cons O
: O
None O
. O

I O
have O
my O
backlight O
set O
at O
3 O
( O
out O
of O
10 O
) O
, O
standard O
mode O
leaves O
it O
at O
8 O
. O

THERE O
IS O
NO O
SECOND O
PORT O
in O
this O
unit O
, O
you O
just O
unplug O
the O
512 O
and O
plug O
in O
the O
2 O
gig O
. O

Also O
is O
very O
confortable O
on O
long O
walkshas O
extra O
space O
( O
not O
just O
for O
photo O
equipment O
) O
. O

Rosewill O
nailed O
it O
with O
this O
pack O
, O
I O
usually O
do O
n't O
sound O
off O
in O
reviews O
but O
this O
pack O
has O
earned O
my O
thumbs O
up O
. O

I O
use O
the O
provided O
pocket O
to O
hold O
a O
USB O
cable O
and O
chargers O
, O
and O
would O
appreciate O
a O
pocket O
for O
airline O
boarding O
passes O
etc O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
project O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
. O

I O
have O
some O
package O
openers O
that O
sadly O
have O
let O
me O
down O
on O
their O
ability O
to O
zip O
open O
these O
packages O
, O
so O
when O
I O
do O
encounter O
them O
I O
resort O
back O
to O
tried O
and O
true O
scissors O
and O
torn O
up O
fingers O
: O

I O
have O
high O
speed O
internet O
connected O
to O
the O
docking O
station O
and O
it O
works O
perfectly O
. O

In O
some O
ways O
I O
do O
miss O
my O
neoprene O
bodyglove O
case O
I O
've O
used O
for O
12 O
" O
and O
14 O
" O
laptops O
of O
the O
past O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
knob O
to O
control O
the O
fan O

Adobe O

included O
( O
very O
nice O
! O

Just O
do O
n't O
stack O
anything O
on O
it O
. O

For O
speakers O
or O
headset O
this O
produces O
an O
acceptable O
sound O
. O

button O
, O
rather O
you O
have O
to O
scan O
. O

Ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
price O
of O
$ O
.01 O
and O
$ O
2 O
. O

The O
internal O
mouse O
works O
fine O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
those O
things O
... O

It O
is O
small O
, O
compact O
, O
organized O
in O
an O
interesting O
way O
. O

trackpad O
is O
somewhat O
unusable O
, O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
do O
tasks O
quick O
with O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
at O
first O
. O

You O
could O
make O
out O
details O
and O
faces O
pretty O
well O
without O
sacrificing O
black O
levels O
. O

I O
have O
used O
it O
with O
Mint O
( O
Ubuntu O
derivative O
) O
and O
Angstrom O
Linux O
. O

The O
portable O
HD O
route O
is O
a O
far O
better O
system O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
I O
get O
the O
correct O
replacement O
quickly O
the O
return O
and O
refund O
have O
also O
been O
completed O
. O

It O
serves O
my O
needs O
at O
a O
low O
cost O
. O

Set O
up O
was O
very O
easy O
. O

It O
just O
takes O
a O
little O
time O
to O
figure O
out O
all O
the O
ways O
to O
replicate O
the O
mouse O
actions O
. O

The O
fit O
is O
bit O
better O
on O
this O
one O
, O
but O
still O
not O
like O
a O
real O
Apple O
battery O
. O

But O
just O
make O
sure O
you O
're O
aware O
of O
the O
space O
capacity O
you O
'll O
really O
be O
needing O
- O
it O
just O
is O
n't O
roomy O
enough O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
any O
cameras O
over O
4MP O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
get O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

This O
thing O
has O
the O
same O
or O
better O
runtime O
, O
looks O
perfect O
and O
I O
trust O
Anker O
as O
a O
company O
. O

Well O
, O
first O
off O
, O
if O
you O
're O
getting O
a O
gameboard O
with O
a O
monstrous O
20 O
+ O
keys O
to O
press O
, O
some O
of O
them O
are O
just O
necessarily O
going O
to O
be O
further O
away O
than O
others O
. O

I O
also O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
fingerprint O
reader O
. O

The O
label O
starts O
to O
rub O
off O
and O
you O
get O
paper O
bits O
on O
your O
fingers O
. O

Only O
drawback O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
place O
to O
fit O
a O
tripod O
. O

The O
burst O
rate O
is O
excellent O
and O
is O
much O
better O
for O
capturing O
action O
than O
the O
aforementioned O
E O
- O
PL1 O
. O

Burning O
Rubber O
smell O
is O
gone O
after O
2 O
months O

so O
I O
will O
give O
the O
adapter O
4 O
stars O
. O

The O
following O
is O
based O
on O
just O
a O
brief O
time O
playing O
with O
the O
machine O
: O
The O
screen O
is O
beautiful O
but O
not O
smudge O
proof O
since O
it O
's O
glossy O
. O

Perfect O
stand O
. O

The O
other O
problem O
was O
the O
dvd O
and O
camera O
would O
be O
disabled O
with O
everyboot O
. O

Recognized O
the O
headset O
and O
was O
working O
in O
minutes O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
did O
not O
go O
for O
any O
expensive O
ones O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
the O
unit O
appears O
to O
work O
properly O
and O
the O
voltages O
are O
as O
stated O

Surely O
it O
would O
not O
have O
added O
too O
much O
to O
the O
cost O
to O
add O
a O
battery O
as O
the O
extra O
weight O
and O
extend O
the O
usage O
time O
of O
the O
system O
. O

but O
if O
you O
turn O
on O
& O
# O
34;tap O
to O
click&#34 O
; O
you O
'll O
only O
actually O
have O
to O
make O
a O
loud O
click O
when O
you O
have O
to O
grab O
and O
drag O
something O
. O

Item O
was O
exactly O
as O
depicted O
. O

This O
provides O
better O
cooling O
and O
does O
n't O
block O
any O
other O
ports O
on O
the O
macbook O
. O

but O
that O
is O
more O
user O
error O
on O
my O
part O

Rugged O
materials O
and O
secure O
connections O
, O
no O
scratchy O
sound O
when O
moving O
around O
. O

Highs O
were O
good O
and O
that O
was O
about O
it O
. O

As O
a O
college O
student O
I O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
books O
and O
things O
around O
, O
and O
I O
just O
love O
this O
little O
guy O
. O

So O
I O
got O
the O
small O
Intuos5 O
tablet O
. O

It O
works O
great O
and O
holds O
a O
long O
charge O
. O

You O
can O
repeat O
the O
process O
to O
save O
videos O
and O
all O
of O
your O
contacts O
from O
your O
phone O
to O
the O
micro O
SD O
card O
. O

With O
the O
software O
AudioWizard O
you O
are O
can O
to O
select O
a O
speech O
mode O
and O
when O
you O
add O
the O
hardware O
features O
included O
on O
this O
model O
I O
believe O
these O
benefits O
add O
up O
to O
increased O
voice O
accuracy O
. O

So O
I O
wo O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
function O
. O

com O
/ O
OXA O

would O
n't O
recommend O
never O

Our O
previous O
one O
was O
permanently O
fixed O
at O
one O
angle O
. O

We O
got O
about O
a O
year O
out O
of O
ours O
before O
it O
started O
going O
bad O
, O
and O
now O
it O
's O
just O
junk O
. O

I O
purchased O
the O
following O
keyboards O
to O
compare O
and O
decide O
on O
what O
I O
liked O
the O
best:1 O
. O

Tried O
in O
all O
possible O
ways O
but O
its O
just O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

If O
you O
need O
more O
bass O
you O
might O
try O
the O
larger O
( O
and O
newer O
) O
ClarityHD O
Micro O
. O

It O
always O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
spare O
, O
you O
never O
know O
when O
it&#8217;s O
going O
to O
quit O
. O

I O
was O
ready O
to O
turn O
the O
thing O
into O
a O
frisbee O
. O

So O
many O
good O
reviews O
already O
I O
only O
have O
a O
bit O
to O
add O
. O

Excellent O
daily O
use O
as O
a O
video O
game O
console O
, O
browsing O
the O
web O
, O
watching O
HDTV O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
netboook O
a O
few O
years O
back O
and O
its O
worked O
out O
great O
for O
what O
i O
needed O
, O
compact O
, O
long O
battery O
and O
decent O
memory O
. O

I O
initially O
had O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
this O
mouse O
. O

It O
also O
provides O
an O
ideal O
typing O
angle O
, O
great O
for O
college O
students O
, O
and O
looks O
fantastic O
( O
I O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
compliments O
on O
campus O
) O
. O

It O
is O
well O
constructed O
with O
a O
metallic O
toned O
black O
plastic O
exterior O
. O

I O
noticed O
some O
other O
reviews O
saying O
that O
their O
battery O
was O
a O
lemon O
, O
too O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
main O
compartment O
also O
contains O
lots O
of O
room O
for O
a O
notebook O
, O
notepads O
, O
and O
books O
. O

This O
product O
works O
, O
but O
not O
very O
well O
. O

Chrome O
OS O
's O
approach O
is O
just O
awkward.- O

If O
you O
play O
games O
, O
browse O
the O
web O
heavily O
, O
socialize O
, O
webcam O
, O
and O
brightness O
all O
the O
way O
up O
, O
you O
'd O
get O
most O
likely O
3 O
- O
4 O
hours O
only O
. O

The O
fit O
is O
perfect O
too O
. O

The O
Flip O
has O
very O
minimal O
controls O
and O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
controlled O
via O
the O
media O
source O
. O

I O
wished O
I O
could O
have O
gotten O
as O
good O
a O
deal O
on O
the O
larger O
versions O
. O

Must O
be O
a O
MS O
thing O
. O

I O
use O
it O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
campus O
network O
. O

Gave O
it O
to O
my O
granddaughter O
to O
use O
on O
an O
older O
laptop O
. O

I O
recieved O
this O
computer O
yesterday O
and O
I O
am O
impressed O
with O
it O
's O
speed O
for O
the O
price O
. O

There O
is O
a O
clear O
seam O
that O
splits O
down O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
entire O
edge O
where O
the O
gray O
backing O
of O
the O
case O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
black O
plastic O
that O
holds O
the O
front O
glass O
face O
. O

So O
it O
's O
very O
important O
that O
you O
install O
that O
utility O
and O
create O
that O
partition O
. O

DVDs O
and O
Netflix O
streaming O
play O
beautifully O
on O
the O
bright O
detailed O
screen O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
, O
you O
have O
things O
plugged O
in O
that O
is O
n't O
being O
used O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
performed O
this O
task O
repeatedly O
on O
the O
Sony O
several O
times O
causing O
elevated O
depression O
and O
anger O
( O
the O
proverbial O
first O
to O
steps O
of O
grief O
DABDA O
) O
- O
and O

( O
expandable O
to O
16 O
GB O
) O
GeForce O
GT O

At O
about O
110 O
F O
it O
is O
uncomfortable O
to O
hold O
something O
that O
is O
hot O
. O

OEM O
- O
that O
's O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
shall O
now O
stay O
banished O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
easier O
to O
use O
if O
staying O
stationary O
, O
but O
I O
've O
found O
it O
's O
light O
enough O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
carrying O
it O
with O
my O
laptop O
when O
going O
to O
meetings O
. O

Apple O
's O
Powerbook O
G4s O
and O
the O
MacBook O
and O
MacBook O
Pros O
) O
really O
need O
this O
cooler O
. O

All O
repairs O
were O
free O
under O
the O
warranty O
. O

Not O
long O
ago O
, O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
one O
that O
would O
record O
a O
video O
feed O
from O
a O
USB O
device O
. O

It O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price O
hands O
down O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
it O
works O
, O

The O
problem O
I O
have O
with O
it O
is O
that O
I O
purchased O
it O
for O
my O
14 O
inch O
Toshiba O
P745-S4320 O
. O

Its O
web O
setup O
interface O
is O
pretty O
easy O
to O
browse O
and O
has O
informative O
Help O
pages O
. O

Looks O
and O
works O
like O
a O
quality O
product O
. O

Flash O
drive O
is O
definitely O
better O
and O
faster O
. O

The O
2011 O
model O
does O
not O
need O
this O
. O

After O
getting O
tired O
of O
barely O
being O
able O
to O
hear O
music O
or O
videos O
from O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
feet O
away O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
GE O
Portable O
USB O
- O
Powered O
Soundbar O
Speaker O
98930 O
. O

This O
is O
simple O
, O
fairly O
priced O
through O
Amazon O
and O
works O
great O
, O
being O
powered O
through O
the O
usb O
port O
of O
your O
laptop O
. O

and O
instantly O
you O
are O
looking O
at O
what O
your O
camera O
sees O
. O

For O
that O
alone O
I O
deducted O
a O
star O
. O

Zagg O
- O
just O
what O
the O
world O
needed O
: O
another O
product O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
as O
advertised O
. O

Unpluged O
it O
right O
there O
and O
then O
.. O
Got O
mine O
at O
Costco O
for O
$ O
119 O
. O

When O
you O
do O
your O
Christmas O
shopping O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
memorize O
information O
from O
one O
window O
as O
you O
activate O
another O
window O
, O
instead O
of O
simply O
glancing O
at O
one O
that O
's O
already O
open O
, O
as O
in O
Windows O
7 O
. O

Make O
sure O
your O
device O
has O
the O
right O
connector O
. O

I O
could O
find O
absolutely O
no O
information O
anywhere O
on O
the O
internet O
about O
this O
topic O
, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
do O
my O
own O
testing O
to O
find O
the O
answer O
. O

Only O
one O
caveat O
... O

I O
did O
see O
another O
version O
of O
this O
that O
is O
more O
of O
a O
prism O
shape O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
plug O
in O
bulk O
plugs O
without O
covering O
up O
the O
other O
outlets O
. O

It O
is O
true O
you O
will O
sometimes O
wish O
you O
had O
one O
more O
certain O
size O
elastic O
band O
here O
or O
there O

I O
get O
about O
3 O
. O
5 O
hours O
to O
5 O
hours O
out O
of O
each O
charge O
- O
and O
I O
have O
the O
power O
settings O
on O
' O
performance O
' O
- O
which O
is O
as O
high O
as O
it O
gets O
- O
I O
imagine O
if O
I O
dialed O
it O
back O
to O
' O
energy O
saving O
' O
I O
could O
get O
more O
. O

So O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
not O
any O
key O
bounce O
( O
double O
or O
triple O
letters O
on O
a O
key O
stroke O
) O
indicates O
a O
fairly O
well O
made O
keyboard O
in O
my O
experience O
. O

The O
cable O
that O
came O
with O
this O
replacement O

I O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
for O
gaming O

Bluetooth O
is O
much O
slower O
than O
USB O
transfer O
speed O
. O

Handy O
because O
the O
cool O
pad O
does O
raise O
the O
computer O
up O
about O
2 O
" O
. O

and O
I O
have O
given O
up O
on O
the O
software O
. O

but O
I O
need O
portability O
and O
style O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
product O
and O
am O
sincerely O
recommanding O
it O
to O
all O
buyers O
who O
are O
seeking O
for O
decent O
instruments O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
at O
home O
. O

I O
gave O
this O
to O
my O
husband O
and O
he O
loved O
it O
! O
! O

Transferred O
this O
jumper O
to O
the O
designated O
pins O
on O
the O
NB O
drive O
and O
the O
system O
booted O
faultlessly O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
4 O
stars O
because O
it O
is O
not O
padded O
very O
well O
and O
if O
it O
is O
dropped O
you O
might O
damage O
your O
computer O
. O

The O
battery O
I O
received O
looks O
nothing O
like O
the O
picture O
and O
does O
not O
match O
the O
description O
. O

The O
output O
ranges O
from O
15 O
to O
24 O
volt O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
a O
70v O
anywhere O
on O
this O
unit O
. O

Portable O
Wireless O
Bluetooth O
Speakeris O
quite O
a O
powerful O
speaker O
for O
the O
size O
with O
really O
great O
bass O
. O

You O
may O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this O
yourself O
, O
but O
I O
rather O
hate O
putting O
these O
infernal O
things O
on O
. O

I O
'm O
getting O
about O
20 O
MB O
/ O
sec O
through O
USB2 O
. O
0 O
; O
partly O
due O
to O
having O
3 O
other O
USB O
items O
( O
keyboard O
, O
mouse O
, O
and O
mic O
) O
hooked O
up O
and O
the O
bandwidth O
is O
shared O
. O

Seriously O
this O
item O
came O
from O
somewhere O
in O
the O
western O
Pacific O
and O
by O
the O
time O
it O
arrived O
at O
my O
house O
I O
had O
forgotten O
why O
I O
wanted O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
! O

She O
does O
n't O
spend O
as O
much O
time O
on O
computer O
as O
I O
do O
, O
but O
she O
reports O
that O
she O
really O
likes O
how O
this O
lightweight O
, O
quiet O
pad O
" O
cools O
down O
" O
the O
computing O
she O
was O
experiencing O
while O
working O
with O
the O
notebook O
directly O
on O
her O
lap O
. O

if O
you O
have O
a O
couple O
hundred O
to O
throw O
away O
on O
something O
that O
makes O
your O
life O
a O
bit O
easier O
/ O
enjoyable O
, O
buy O
this O
. O

It O
is O
absolutely O
inconceivable O
to O
me O
that O
anyone O
could O
give O
these O
less O
than O
five O
stars O
and O
then O
complain O
that O
they O
are O
limited O
to O
that O
. O

The O
battery O
check O
has O
detected O
a O
failure O
. O

The O
speakers O
are O
OK O
but O
by O
listening O
to O
them O
, O
I O
always O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
these O
manufacturers O
force O
you O
to O
buy O
home O
theaters O
! O

This O
" O
Lenovo O
Ideapad O
Z570 O
" O
is O
actually O
the O
first O
new O
computer O
I O
have O
owned O
in O
about O
eight O
years O
. O

I O
think O
it O
should O
assume O
I O
have O
one O
and O
then O
provide O
suggestions O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
. O

Just O
remember O
what O
this O
is O
and O
treat O
it O
accordingly O
. O

This O
was O
an O
emergancy O
quick O
fix O
for O
my O
daughter O
that O
needed O
internet O
access O
wireless O
quickly O
. O

I O
m O
not O
Luly O
by O
the O
way O
that O
s O
my O
mom O

Look O
carefully O
at O
how O
the O
cable O
is O
plugged O
in O
- O
the O
socket O
is O
a O
zif O
socket O
- O
you O
have O
to O
pop O
it O
open O
, O
gently O
, O
no O
parts O
come O
off O
, O
it O
clicks O
and O
the O
cable O
releases O
, O
then O
you O
put O
the O
new O
cable O
in O
, O
and O
--- O
half O
the O
keys O
do O
n't O
work O
. O

Although O
not O
as O
important O
, O
packaging O
of O
this O
product O
was O
nice O
. O

Great O
product O
! O

I O
can O
not O
say O
I O
was O
blown O
away O
, O
but O
it O
's O
an O
okay O
camera O
for O
basic O
needs O
. O

I O
received O
model O
A1343 O
, O
not O
A1222 O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
delighted O
with O
the O
capacity O
, O
quality O
and O
utility O
of O
the O
Targus O
bag O
. O

So O
, O
I O
looked O
on O
Amazon O
, O
and O
found O
this O
speaker O
. O

My O
MAC O
is O
better O
protected O
from O
scratches O
now O
, O
plus O
I O
like O
the O
grooves O
on O
the O
underside O
, O
as O
it O
allows O
for O
air O
flow O
.. O
there O
are O
little O

I O
am O
a O
little O
puzzled O
by O
a O
couple O
of O
them O
saying O
the O
product O
is O
light O
and O
feels O
cheap O

I O
love O
the O
price O
, O
quality O
, O
and O
look O
. O

and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
update O
to O
the O
newest O
drivers O
right O
away O
. O

I O
also O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
pay O
much O
because O
bags O
can O
cost O
around O
$ O
100 O
and O
that O
is O
not O
what O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
such O
a O
simple O
product O
. O

This O
thing O
runs O
cool O
, O
quiet O
, O
goes O
about O
6 O
hours O
on O
a O
charge O
and O
sells O
for O
dirt O
. O

and O
I O
believe O
it O
will O
connect O
with O
any O
blue O
tooth O
enabled O
device O
without O
fail O
. O

I O
've O
played O
games O
from O
my O
PS3 O
through O
HDMI O
and O
from O
the O
PC O
and O
no O

REVOLUTION O
. O

--you O
can O
always O
attach O
another O
keyboard O
to O
the O
thing O
) O

It O
costs O
over O
50 O
% O
less O
than O
an O
apple O
product O
. O

A O
very O
practical O
case O
, O
with O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
compartments O
for O
storage O
and O
the O
perfect O
size O
. O

It O
goes O
great O
with O
the O
black O
tablet O
. O

The O
lower O
section O
is O
padded O
very O
well O
, O
and O
though O
there O
is O
of O
course O
movable O
Velcro O
walls O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
less O
mobile O
that O
I O
would O
like O
. O

I O
plugged O
in O
the O
charger O
until O
it O
said O
charge O
complete O
, O
and O
then O
once O
i O
unplug O
it O
, O
the O
charge O
lasts O
about O
a O
minute O
. O

I O
had O
read O
many O
reviews O
about O
how O
poorly O
it O
works O
. O

But O
still O
sounds O
amazing O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
very O
fun O
to O
use O
, O
uber O
convenient O
, O
light O
, O
excellent O
screen O
resolution O
for O
a O
netbook O
, O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
power O
for O
its O
class O
. O

The O
speaker O
has O
a O
maximum O
audio O
output O
of O
12 O
watts O
( O
6 O
watts O
each O
channel O
) O
. O

No O
clips O
were O
broken O
during O
the O
period O
of O
more O
than O
a O
month O
it O
has O
been O
installed O
. O

Windows O
is O
a O
bear O
compared O
to O
OS O
X. O
Mac O
app O
store O
and O
games O
are O
cool O
. O

I O
just O
positioned O
the O
USB O
fan O
at O
one O
end O
of O
the O
tube O
and O
still O
keeps O
it O
cool O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
a O
little O
smaller O
than O
the O
picture O
would O
suggest O
. O

Price O

Under O

They O
come O
with O
a O
high O
quality O
nylon O
woven O
fabric O
insulation O
over O
the O
plastic O
, O
that O
provides O
better O

and O
gives O
them O
a O
very O
high O

I O
like O
having O
a O
better O

Worked O
for O
almost O
a O
month O

I O
have O
dual O

had O

it O
was O
turned O
off O

Took O
me O
three O
washes O
for O
the O
chemical O
smell O
to O
fade O
. O

I O
'm O
happy O
to O
have O
purchase O
this O
item O
over O
competing O
products O
. O

They O
noted O
that O
the O
Broadcom O

is O

This O

no O

I O
do O

However O
it O
is O

I O
am O
impressed O
with O
how O
well O
this O

can O
handle O

I O

it O

SECOND O
UPDATE O
: O

I O
want O
to O
stress O
the O
balanced O
part O
of O
the O
bass O
because O
some O
other O
headphones O
overdo O
the O
bass O
( O
notably O
the O
Kraken O
pro O
series O
I O
owned O
before O
) O
and O
you O
end O
up O
with O
an O
almost O
continuous O
& O

; O
garbled O

. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
actually O
works O

Both O
are O
well O
designed O
, O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
and O
beautiful O
to O
look O
at O
. O

Very O
impressed O
with O
this O
palm O
sized O
speaker O
. O

You O
can O
add O
multiple O
wifi O
- O
WAN O
profiles O
, O
and O
the O
router O
will O
automatically O
pick O
the O
strongest O
one O
it O
sees O

works O
well O
over O
the O
internet O
! O

Multitasks O
easily O
. O

I O
have O
found O
the O
iK50 O
to O
be O
a O
great O
extension O
for O
the O
Kindle O
Fire O
. O

it O
's O
still O
not O
a O
bad O
purchase O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
because O
of O
the O
durability O
issues O
you O
'll O
most O
likely O
have O
to O
buy O
more O
than O
one O
. O

This O
product O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
and O
setup O
and O
has O
given O
me O
no O
problems O
and O
flawless O
connections O
. O

Designed O
in O
black O
, O
the O
hub O
is O
very O
stylish O
, O
and O
the O
smaller O
pigtail O
keeps O
the O
adapter O
with O
in O
arms O
reach O
at O
all O
times O
, O
but O
also O
keeps O
the O
unit O
from O
blocking O
nearby O
USB O
ports O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
use O
a O
Mac O
and O
the O
installation O
was O
simple O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O
! O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
have O
gotten O
him O
a O
desktop O
so O
he O
could O
learn O
some O
things O
about O
installing O
and O
upgrading O
, O
but O
this O
was O
simply O
too O
good O
a O
price O
to O
pass O
up O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
anything O
but O
good O
to O
say O
about O
my O
laptop O
from O
Dell O
. O

, O
it O
does O
n't O
look O
cheap O

this O

I O
am O
typing O

I O
have O
to O
applaud O
Amazon O
for O
refunding O
me O
an O
additional O
$ O
200 O
after O
the O
tv O
was O
delivered O
, O
since O
the O
price O
dropped O
on O
Amazon O
on O
the O
day O
of O
delivery O
by O
$ O
200 O
. O

Had O
to O
go O
to O
website O
to O
try O
several O
things O
and O
finally O
found O
a O
link O
to O
microsoft O
and O
downloaded O
the O
proper O
drivers O
. O

: O
the O
pen O
has O
a O
nice O
, O
solid O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
it O
writes O
like O
a O
quality O
writing O
tool O
, O
the O
digital O
recorder O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
software O
simple O
and O
intuitive O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Comes O
with O
all O
hardware O
needed O
to O
use O
you O
new O
HDD O
or O
SSD O
as O
a O
backup O

MS O
Office O
: O

I O
carry O
my O
MacBook O
and O
when O
I O
take O
the O
charger O
it O
sometime O
creates O
a O
small O
bulge O
. O

I O
bought O
an O
HP O
printer O
6510 O
e O
model O
( O
wireless O
) O
also O
through O
Amazon O
for O
a O
great O
price O
and O
it O
installed O
fine O
. O

I O
think O
its O
perfect O
! O
will O
probably O
get O
another O
one O
! O

It O
turns O
out O
the O
problems O
was O
with O
the O
Motorolas O
- O
not O
the O
minijack O
. O

I O
also O
see O
that O
the O
battery O
life O
drains O
significantly O
if O
I O
'm O
viewing O
a O
lot O
of O
HD O
videos O
( O
streaming O
) O
or O
if O
I O
'm O
' O
power O
using O
' O
google O
chrome O
, O
meaning O
a O
lot O
of O
tabs O
open O
. O

You O
also O
can O
connect O
to O
your O
computer O
and O
watch O
movies O
from O
there O
. O

The O
" O
On O
/ O
Off O
" O
button O
is O
very O
cheap O
feeling O
. O

I O
just O
wish O
the O
touch O
screen O
would O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
responsive O
. O

I O
had O
several O
near O
misses O
at O
first O
when O
I O
was O
quickly O
trying O
to O
repack O
everything O
after O
getting O
through O
the O
security O
line O
. O

As O
I O
conclude O
writing O
this O
brief O
review O
at O
8:04 O
pm O
I O
now O
have O
81 O
% O
battery O
life O
remaining O
. O

The O
design O
is O
sleek O
and O
sexy O
and O
it O
feels O
solid O
when O
typing O
and O
also O
when O
opening O
, O
closing O
and O
carrying O
it O
around O
. O

The O
top O
, O
bottom O
, O
front O
, O
and O
back O
are O
all O
a O
single O
solid O
piece O
of O
metal O
, O
and O
it O
's O
HEAVY O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
the O
first O
time O
my O
MBP O
takes O
ding O
. O

Seeing O
how O
my O
laptop O
was O
an O
older O
one O
I O
just O
dismissed O
the O
short O
run O
time O
as O
a O
product O
as O
old O
technology O
, O
but O
now O
I O
realize O
it O
was O
probably O
a O
defective O
product O
. O

I O
had O
also O
previously O
bought O
a O
keyboard O
cover O
at O
a O
brick O
- O
and O
- O
mortar O
store O
, O
but O
it O
was O
folded O
in O
a O
box O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
fit O
well O
at O
all O
. O

I O
only O
surfed O
websites O
, O
no O
video O
or O
graphic O
intensive O
sites O
were O
visited O
. O

but O
it O
was O
cheaper O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
alternatives O
that O
were O
$ O
99 O
. O
00 O

That O
does O
n't O
happen O
with O
this O
adapter O
. O

i O
now O
get O
up O
to O
5 O
. O
5 O
hours O
out O
of O
my O
mini O
4 O
if O
using O
the O
external O
usb O
dvd O
drive O
. O

It O
's O
not O
the O
company O
's O
fault O
. O

Comes O
loaded O
with O
a O
ton O
of O
apps O
I O
'll O
likely O
not O
use O
, O
only O
a O
few O
useful O
ones O
that O
interest O
me O
. O

So O
, O
my O
decision O
has O
been O
to O
keep O
this O
500 O
GB O
hybrid O
drive O
instead O
of O
going O
back O
to O
my O
smaller O
Solid O
State O
Drive O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
novice O
user O
and O
was O
able O
to O
add O
a O
read O
- O
only O
folder O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family O
to O
look O
at O
files O
( O
eBooks O
, O
music O
, O
movies O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
without O
the O
ability O
to O
delete O
them O
. O

This O
was O
a O
gift O
to O
my O
dad O

Considered O
buying O
a O
new O
one O
but O
found O
there O
are O
loads O
of O
replacement O

's O
out O
there O
. O

I O
found O
it O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price O

given O
the O

, O
the O

is O
visible O
only O

you O

A O
small O

it O
properlky O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
. O

Unless O
you O
have O
something O
that O
is O
fairly O
long O
to O
fit O
in O
the O
bag O
, O
the O

may O
be O

With O
this O

, O
I O
can O
swap O

from O
one O

to O
another O
with O
very O
fast O

can O

Was O
originjally O
going O
to O
put O
this O
one O
into O
the O
Acer O
4720Z O
, O
buit O
instead O
, O
I O
put O
in O
in O
THIS O
one O
, O
the O
4720Z O
and O
rotated O
the O
battery O
that O
was O
in O
THIS O
one O
over O
to O
the O
4720Z O
! O
! O

I O
checked O
the O
manual O
that O
came O
with O
my O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
, O
entered O
the O
code O
it O
listed O
, O
which O
was O
simply O
0000 O
, O
and O
the O
keyboard O
was O
then O
successfully O
paired O
. O

But O
it O
feels O
cheap O
. O

Holds O
up O
well O
and O
padded O
well O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

I O
sent O
these O
items O
along O
and O
thought O
that O
they O
would O
advise O
that O
if O
I O
sent O
the O
backpack O
, O
back O
to O
them O
, O
they O
would O
replace O
the O
clasp O
. O

Ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
that O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
order O
this O
again O
if O
needed O
. O

There O
are O
3 O
compartments O
inside O
the O
main O
area O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
for O
a O
Christmas O
present O
. O

i O
just O
got O
my O
cover O
three O
weeks O
ago O
, O
i O
am O
excessively O
clean O
, O
and O
just O
from O
continual O
touching O
, O
it O
has O
changed O
a O
lot O
alreadyalso O
, O
because O
my O
computer O
is O
so O
light O
, O
the O
front O
of O
the O
cover O
pulls O
the O
screen O
down O

It O
is O
fast O
again O
and O
a O
pleasure O
to O
use O
. O

The O
other O
negative O
is O
more O
minor O
. O

The O
stand O
that O
unfolds O
does O
not O
stay O
open O
very O
well O
so O
is O
pretty O
much O
worthless O
. O

Easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
seems O
loud O
enough O
. O

Where O
did O
I O
put O
that O
USB O
stick O
? O

It O
seems O
waterproof O
, O
bomb O
proof O
, O
bullet O
proof O
and O
destruction O
proof O
. O

I O
also O
use O
full O
- O
screen O
mode O
online O
to O
maximize O
every O
inch O
of O
the O
11-inch O
screen O
. O

I O
purchased O
it O
to O
commute O
to O
work O
with O
my O
laptop O
/ O
lunch O
/ O
random O
books O
etc O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

There O
is O
a O
cinch O
string O
with O
lock O
to O
hold O
the O
cover O
in O
place O
. O

So O
this O
was O
a O
big O
surprise O
. O

i O
am O
using O
Kingston O
https://www O
. O
amazon O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
this O
little O
device O
is O
amazing O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyonewho O
would O
like O
to O
use O
a O
normal O
mouse O
while O
being O
mobile O
. O

They O
wo O
n't O
send O
you O
a O
replacement O
. O

I O
'll O
stick O
with O
it O
for O
a O
little O
longer O
and O
update O
my O
review O
if O
I O
feel O
differently O
. O

My O
only O
gripe O
would O
be O
that O
the O
pockets O
in O
the O
side O
pouch O
are O
only O
a O
couple O
inches O
deep O
, O
nothing O
really O
stays O
in O
the O
without O
falling O
out O
. O

Fast O
shipping O
. O

Had O
a O
hard O
time O
finding O
an O
external O
enclosure O
. O

A O
nice O
feature O
is O
that O
the O
bottom O
is O
waterproofed O
, O
although O
that O
protection O
does O
not O
extend O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
front O
pocket O
, O
which O
, O
if O
your O
backpack O
is O
n't O
loaded O
to O
the O
max O
, O
also O
sits O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
fan O
can O
be O
moved O
around O
anywhere O
on O
the O
grating O
if O
there O
is O
a O
particular O
spot O
of O
the O
laptop O
you O
would O
like O
to O
cool O
. O

I O
've O
had O
several O
UPSs O
now O
for O
a O
while O
. O

But O
on O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
it O
certainly O
will O
remind O
you O
of O
all O
the O
scratches O
that O
never O
made O
it O
to O
your O
MacBook O
! O

I O
did O
notice O
, O
however O
, O
that O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
worked O
flawlessly O
in O
the O
camera O
and O
computer O
, O
the O
speed O
of O
transfer O
was O
slower O
than O
other O
cards O
I O
tried O
in O
the O
same O
reader O
. O

My O
friend O
bought O
the O
black O
one O
and O
it O
has O
more O
of O
a O
flat O
matte O
which O
seems O
to O
repel O
scratches O
a O
little O
better O
- O
that O
's O
just O
an O
FYI O
. O

1st O
time O
tablet O
user O
so O
idk O
if O
its O
just O
me O

It O
's O
quite O
impressive O
given O
the O
small O
, O
convenient O
package O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
when O
viewing O
the O
notes O
using O
the O
viewer O
that O
is O
on O
the O
receiver O
, O
you O
can O
save O
your O
notes O
as O
PDF O
's O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
one O
that O
everyone O
else O
mentions O
too O
and O
that O
is O
the O
general O
sluggishness O
that O
this O
machine O
has O
. O

What O
really O
disappoints O
me O
about O
these O
speakers O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
dials O
. O

Most O
regular O
notebooks O
are O
6 O
- O
8 O
lbs O
. O

There O
is O
ample O
padding O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage O
compartments O
, O
some O
of O
which O
I O
may O
never O
use O
. O

To O
further O
illustrate O
, O
the O
Macbook O
Air O
SSD O
opens O
up O
Adobe O
Photoshop O
in O
3 O
seconds O
. O

I O
spent O
a O
good O
six O
to O
seven O
hours O
on O
the O
tablet O
after O
receiving O
it O

I O
solved O
that O
by O
cutting O
it O
off O
and O
mending O
the O
cuts O
with O
a O
fabric O
mend O
. O

had O
bought O
my O
daughter O
the O
BookBook O
case O
at O
4 O
times O
the O
price O
since O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
'd O
like O
this O
case O
. O

we O
use O
the O
bose O
3 O
a O
lot O
( O
for O
our O
digital O
piano O
) O
and O
hence O
we O
needed O
an O
extra O
battery O
! O

There O
's O
more O
padding O
and O
it O
's O
more O
uniformly O
distributed O
around O
where O
the O
laptop O
sits O
, O
than O
in O
the O
older O
bags O
. O

To O
do O
that O
type O
in O
" O
energy O
manager O
" O
on O
the O
start O
screen O
( O
when O
the O
screen O
shows O
up O
start O
typing O
; O
there O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
a O
place O
to O
type O
in O
) O
. O

Good O
, O
hard O
protected O
pocket O
on O
front O
for O
sunglasses O
, O
phone O
etc O
. O

Just O
wish O
the O
USB O
port O
supplied O
more O
power O
. O

The O
optical O
drive O
here O
now O
is O
something O
I O
appreciate O
, O
which O
was O
missing O
on O
the O
previous O
13 O
. O
3 O
inch O
one O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
: O
poney O
up O
the O
extra O
money O
for O
a O
Mac O
; O
Once O
you O
're O
up O
and O
running O
, O
you O
may O
never O
look O
back O
at O
Windows O
again O
( O
except O
, O
of O
course O
, O
for O
games O
! O
) O

And O
I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
said O
shot O
: O
they O
've O
done O
wonders O
for O
the O
sound O
quality O
on O
the O
TV O
. O

In O
BIOS O
there O
is O
no O
indication O
of O
compatibility O
problems O
. O

I O
moved O
it O
to O
different O
outlets O
with O
no O
change O
. O

Hockey O
puck O
shaped O
and O
sized O
, O
it O
features O
four O
USB O
ports O
and O
a O
connected O
USB O
cable O
to O
connect O
to O
your O
computer O
. O

Do O
n't O
blame O
me O
if O
you O
lose O
your O
data O
. O

This O
is O
an O
awesome O
adapter O
. O

Installed O
in O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
that O
had O
a O
failed O
battery O
. O

I O
try O
and O
get O
a O
new O
one O
! O

so O
I O
have O
5 O
left O
so O
ill O

though O
the O
description O
says O
it O
is O
compatible O
with O
dell O
inspiron O

This O
case O
is O
a O
5 O
star O
case O
for O
me O
. O

Still O
loving O
this O
keyboard O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
for O
a O
couple O
months O
now O
and O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
once O
in O
a O
while O
it O
will O
not O
work O
and O
i O
have O
to O
restart O
the O
computer O
for O
it O
to O
start O
woring O
again O
. O

It O
is O
made O
of O
very O
thin O
plastic O
, O
but O
it O
has O
n't O
failed O
. O

Given O
the O
premium O
expense O
, O
it O
's O
a O
disappointment O
. O

They O
also O
look O
as O
though O
they O
might O
be O
top O
- O
heavy O
and O
tend O
to O
capsize O
but O
they O
do O
not O
. O

so O
I O
could O
be O
a O
tad O
bit O
biased O
here O
. O

If O
I O
worked O
in O
some O
classied O
job O
then O
I O
might O
understand O
IT O
being O
so O
paranoid O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
and O
the O
constant O
logging O
off O
is O
just O
annoying O
. O

I O
've O
installed O
an O
8 O
gig O
sd O
card O
which O
it O
reads O
very O
nicely O
, O
and O
have O
transferred O
many O
files O
directly O
from O
my O
desktop O
without O
any O
complication O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
flawlessly O
so O
far O
. O

It O
works O
on O
my O
iMac O
27&#34 O
; O
, O
but O
the O
directions O
did O
n't O
help O
. O

I O
've O
got O
a O
laptop O
, O
kindle O
, O
cables O
, O
a O
journal O
, O
and O
various O
usb O
drives O
and O
adapters O
that O
I O
use O
when O
working O
on O
computers O
. O

The O
only O
negatives O
are O
that O
its O
pricey O
, O
and O
the O
trackpad O
is O
kind O
of O
crappy O
. O

This O
was O
right O
after O
warranty O
expired O
of O
course O

Overall O
, O
for O
699 O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
purchase O
and O
should O
serve O
me O
well O
. O

Good O
size O
and O
quality O
. O

if O
you O
installed O
it O
With O
the O
adapter O
plugged O
in O
, O
your O
computer O
does O
not O
recognize O
it O
, O
unplug O
it O
, O
uninstall O
the O
program O
, O
reinstall O
, O
reboot O
and O
plug O
in O
, O
enjoy O
! O

At O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
shoot O
day O
, O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
spend O
my O
time O
resting O
rather O
than O
transferring O
data O
. O

and O
this O
keyboard O
helps O
to O
reduce O
mistakes O
. O

I O
always O
buy O
corsair O
memory O
for O
my O
computers O
and O
for O
the O
price O
and O
performance O
you O
can O
not O
beat O
them O
. O

Would O
be O
awesome O
if O
bluetooth O
would O
allow O
to O
link O
to O
2 O
Bose O
speakers O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
3 O
of O
them O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
16 O
GB O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
upon O
receiving O
it O
and O
confirming O
that O
it O
would O
not O
store O
all O
of O
my O
equipment O
, O
I O
ordered O
a O
second O
. O

this O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
either O
way O
. O

Hopefully O
the O
longevity O
is O
good O
, O
but O
considering O
the O
cost O
, O
I O
'd O
still O
be O
happy O
even O
if O
this O
did O
n't O
last O
as O
long O
as O
the O
stock O
battery O
. O

Overall O
the O
phone O
feels O
well O
built O
. O

Good O
compact O
bag O
and O
looked O
sharp O
! O

I O
can O
designate O
a O
slot O
to O
a O
particular O
card O
and O
give O
the O
card O
a O
number O
which O
I O
write O
on O
the O
plastic O
slot O
. O

Easy O
setup O
. O

Let O
me O
clear O
up O
some O
of O
the O
things O
that O
I O
have O
read O
about O
this O
protective O
cover O
for O
the O
Acer O
A500 O
. O

Makes O
me O
feel O
like O
it O
is O
protecting O
my O
netbook O
without O
feeling O
like O
a O
brick O
on O
my O
shoulder O
. O

; O
like O
many O
products O
of O
this O
type O
the O
instructions O
manual O
is O
lacking O
and O
, O
in O
this O
case O
, O
erroneously O
lists O
the O
power O
requirements O
as O
AC O
when O
it O
should O
be O
DC.- O
Distortion O
; O
at O
maximum O
audio O
levels O
this O
sounds O
pretty O
badMisc O
: O

I O
also O
played O
a O
frequency O
test O
file O
that O
started O
at O
20Hz O
and O
found O
that O
the O
speakers O
started O
producing O
sound O
around O
the O
45 O
- O
50Hz O
range O
which O
was O
pretty O
low O
for O
such O
a O
small O
speaker O
. O

Great O
sound O
, O
picture O
, O
viewing O
angles O
a O
great O
. O

Purchased O
this O
router O
after O
spouse O
fried O
a O
previous O
one O
plugging O
phone O
line O
into O
internet O
port O
. O

It O
's O
ideal O
for O
travel O
- O
can O
fit O
into O
your O
glove O
box O
in O
the O
car O
, O

I O
was O
skeptical O
about O
ordering O
a O
non O
om O
battery O
for O
my O
laptop O

They O
come O
with O
a O
decent O
zippered O
pouch O
for O
traveling O
and O
mobility O
. O

I O
love O
the O
scrolling O
wheel O
. O

But O
, O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
whole O
experience O
including O
watching O
movies O
, O
playing O
games O
, O
and O
listening O
to O
music O
, O
etc O
... O
, O
then O
this O
Notebook O
is O
not O
for O
you O
. O

And O
transferring O
between O
multiple O
drives O
was O
clearly O
limited O
by O
the O
processor O
and O
not O
the O
USB2 O
. O
0 O
ports O
. O

Smooth O
and O
fast O
performance O
. O

it O
has O
a O
small O
JBL O
speaker O
at O
the O
underside O
by O
the O
battery O
. O

nice O
clear O
screen O
, O
easy O
to O
install O
. O

This O
Satechi O
hub O
looks O
great O
and O
works O
perfectly O
. O

This O
product O
is O
really O
not O
working O
with O
my O
printer O
. O

my O
MacBook O
Pro O

The O
two O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
ports O
work O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
because O
my O
Mac O
Pro O
is O
in O
a O
cabinet O
and O
the O
Bluetooth O
does O
n't O
reach O
. O

Although O
they O
had O
blue O
loctite O
on O
them O
, O
it O
was O
not O
firmly O
screwed O
on O
. O

For O
those O
that O
are O
wondering O
how O
you O
click O
and O
drag O
if O
there O
's O
no O
actual O
button O
, O
you O
just O
kind O
of O
pretend O
there O
is O
a O
button O
. O

They O
seem O
to O
work O
just O
fine O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
protection O
and O
the O
ability O
to O
camouflage O
my O
laptop O
and O
it O
does O
both O
very O
well O
. O

By O
far O
the O
biggest O
drawback O
is O
that O
Chrome O
OS O
does O
not O
support O
Java O
and O
never O
will O
. O

The O
power O
supply O
itself O
works O
very O
well O
on O
these O

Be O
aware O
that O
while O
the O
internal O
SSD O
is O
fast O
( O
700 O
MB O
/ O
s O
) O
, O
it O
's O
still O
miles O
slower O
than O
the O
RAM O
, O
and O
the O
system O
will O
tank O
if O
it O
has O
to O
page O
the O
swap O
file O
. O

It O
's O
the O
best O
sound O
I O
've O
heard O
in O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

I O
have O
agreed O
to O
provide O
a O
fair O
, O
honest O
, O
and O
true O
review O
of O
this O
product O
. O

You O
have O
very O
limited O
storage O
on O
the O
unit O
itself O
, O
so O
stock O
up O
on O
USBs O
. O

It O
is O
an O
Ultrabook O
, O
which O
means O
it O
is O
Windows O
- O
based O
computer O
that O
is O
thin O
, O
reasonably O
light O
, O
and O
has O
an O
Intel O
chipset O
inside O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
cable O
I O
purchased O
from O
this O
manufacturer O
and O
my O
Olympus O
PEN O
fails O
to O
connect O
. O

Ok O
ok O
I O
've O
been O
using O
regular O
old O
windows O
user O
for O
years O
and O
this O
is O
my O
first O
tile O
experience O
. O

Once O
you O
boot O
up O
this O
device O
you O
will O
notice O
right O
away O
the O
sharp O
images O
this O
laptop O
can O
display O
. O

The O
flat O
keyboard O
is O
not O
my O
favorite O
kind O
, O
so O
I O
use O
a O
separate O
keyboard O
with O
indented O
letters O
. O

Purchased O
this O
item O
to O
add O
additional O
fire O
wire O
ports O
in O
my O
CustoMAC O
. O

I O
am O
updating O
my O
review O
of O
these O
cables O
because O
at O
first O
I O
thought O
that O
they O
were O
some O
great O
cables O
. O

I O
'm O
completely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
case O
and O
if O
my O
friends O
or O
family O
ever O
get O
a O
new O
macbook O
, O
I O
'm O
gon O
na O
recommend O
this O
to O
them O

But O
, O
the O
interior O
padding O
compensates O
to O
protect O
the O
camera O
equipment O
. O

Will O
not O

ROCKS O

oh O
so O
lame O
soft O
sided O
plastic O
sleave O
for O
its O
2 O

Network O
10/100Mbps O
Ethernet O
Adapter O
gives O
you O
an O
Ethernet O
port O
( O
wired O
connection O
to O
the O
Internet O
) O
when O
your O
internal O
hardware O
dies O
, O
or O
the O
device O
you O
're O
using O
simply O
does O
n't O
have O
one O
. O

It O
fits O
and O
came O
charged O
to O
about O
80 O
% O

Buuuuut O
after O
a O
couple O
months O
of O
use O
, O
the O

up O

ripped O
off O

Update O
: O
I O
am O
surprised O
no O
one O
mentioned O
, O
that O
the O
Soundlink O
needs O
to O
be O
on O
, O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
before O
it O
sounds O
its O
best O
. O

A O
nice O
touch O
is O
that O
FN+Enter O
= O
CTRL+ALT+DEL O
. O

Can O
also O
fit O
other O
things O
too O
. O

AMAZINGLY O
small O
, O
light O
and O
thin O
- O
easily O
put O
in O
your O
laptop O
case O
and O
take O
with O
you O
everywhere O
. O

The O
Qosmio O
however O
has O
a O
nice O
sleek O
and O
elegant O
paint O
job O
, O
the O
red O
accents O
are O
shiny O
and O
chrome O
- O
like O
but O
not O
too O
shiny O
. O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
spending O
that O
much O
money O
on O
a O
backpack O
I O
bring O
to O
work O
. O

Trackpad O
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
had O
3 O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
as O
far O
as O
really O
keeping O
the O
computer O
cool O
. O

I O
only O
bought O
it O
because O
I O
was O
itching O
to O
get O
into O
the O
digital O
art O
world O
and O
can O
not O
as O
of O
yet O
afford O
what O
I O
really O
want O
, O
The O
Wacom O
Cintiq O
21 O
. O

I O
suggest O
buying O
from O
a O
seller O
shipping O
from O
California O
. O

so O
I O
use O
a O
Anycom O
Bluetooth O
CF O
card O
. O

But O
as O
all O
thing O
memory O
related O
, O
pricing O
will O
most O
likely O
even O
get O
better O
in O
a O
few O
months O
. O

I O
have O
used O
this O
memory O
card O
with O
my O
Canon O
Rebel O
for O
about O
two O
years O
. O

Given O
the O
proliferation O
of O
USB O
devices O
, O
one O
never O
has O
enough O
sockets O
on O
a O
laptop O
. O

One O
major O
con O
. O

The O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
cover O
has O
to O
be O
open O
to O
charge O
it O
. O

At O
various O
times O
, O
I O
stuffed O
a O
day O
planner O
, O
stuffed O
animal O
( O
our O
version O
of O
a O
traveling O
gnome O
) O
, O
and O
other O
items O
in O
there O
for O
quick O
storage O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
V7 O
backpack O
, O
I O
also O
have O
the O
16 O
inch O
top O
- O
loader O
case O
and O
the O
16 O
inch O
front O
loader O
case O
. O

The O
edges O
of O
the O
laptop O
are O
square O
while O
the O
edges O
of O
this O
sleeve O
are O
rounded O
. O

When O
I O
used O
the O
Cineplayer O
software O
, O
it O
updated O
itself O
, O
which O
meant O
it O
deleted O
the O
entire O
package O
from O
the O
machine O
, O
then O
quit O
. O

The O
multimedia O
control O
buttons O
light O
up O
, O
and O
so O
does O
the O
HP O
logo O
on O
the O
front O
. O

I O
got O
this O
to O
replace O
the O
original O
that O
finally O
went O
bad O
in O
my O
daughter O
's O
mid-2008 O
macbook O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
great O
when O
you O
're O
in O
Metro O
/ O
Modern O
, O
but O
in O
Desktop O
mode O
it O
drains O
pretty O
fast O
-- O
I O
rarely O
get O
more O
than O
3:00 O
out O
of O
it O
even O
with O
the O
display O
at O
25 O
% O
. O

I O
wanted O
a O
small O
bag O
for O
my O
iPad O
that O
would O
also O
hold O
various O
iPad O
accessories O
such O
as O
a O
charger O
, O
etc O
. O

Other O
have O
mentioned O
using O
an O
external O
adapter O
to O
provide O
power O
so O
that O
only O
one O
USB O
port O
is O
taken O
up O
on O
your O
computer O
which O
is O
perfectly O
acceptable O
too O
. O

I O
need O
a O
speaker O
that O
delivers O
great O
sound O
for O
music O
and O
one O
that O
I O
can O
follow O
True O
TV O
court O
cases O
on O
when O
they O
are O
streamed O
live O
. O

With O
free O
super O
saver O
shipping O
, O
I O
consider O
that O
to O
be O
amazing O
. O

The O
FE6 O
only O
improves O
your O
headphones O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
change O
/ O
enhance O
the O
audio O
source O
itself O
, O
so O
the O
FE6 O
is O
n't O
for O
any O
device O
that O
supports O
headphones O
. O

el O
uso O
que O
e O
le O
deberia O
dar O
a O
este O
equipo O
va O
muy O
bien O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
thing O
is O
the O
MagSafe O
power O
connector O
. O

I O
was O
sorely O
disappointed O
. O

After O
a O
couple O
months O
it O
started O
to O
buzz O
loudly O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
standout O
product O
in O
that O
space O
. O

I O
received O
the O
item O
on O
December O
30th O
. O

Asus O
should O
ship O
a O
screw O
driver O
with O
the O
unit O
. O

The O
headphones O
work O
well O
and O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
good O
for O
the O
price O
. O

The O
main O
innovative O
thought O
in O
its O
design O
is O
the O
small O
plastic O
tip O
attached O
to O
the O
stylus O
via O
a O
string O
near O
the O
pocket O
clip O
: O
it O
allows O
you O
to O
attach O
the O
stylus O
to O
your O
device O
by O
insertion O
into O
its O
headphone O
jack O
. O

+ O
I O
'm O
updating O
my O
rating O
to O
4-stars O
. O

It O
has O
a O
good O
CPU O
, O
a O
good O
GPU O
, O
and O
good O
RAM O
. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
here O
before O
buying O
. O

I O
m O
writing O
to O
you O
because O
I O
would O
like O
to O
save O
you O
from O
your O
own O
curiosity O
and O
hopes O
in O
making O
this O
laptop O
work O
for O
you O
only O
due O
to O
its O
attractive O
price O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
have O
any O
doubts O
or O
questions O
about O
the O
item O
, O
I O
will O
contact O
the O
company O
first O
. O

Great O

a O
great O
price O
with O
a O
very O
very O
fast O

The O
install O
from O
the O

was O
one O
of O
the O
usual O
drawn O
out O
creative O
affairs O
that O
I O
remember O
from O
times O
past O
. O

* O
really O

will O
not O
make O

The O

is O
clear O

which O
gives O
the O

a O
very O
classy O

distinct O

which O
sets O
it O
apart O

For O
that O

the O

really O
shined O

Wonder O
why O
that O
might O
be O
.... O

D O

Item O
is O
as O
described O
and O
works O
great O
. O

For O
a O
price O
of O
$ O
450 O

for O
this O

, O
one O
can O
buy O
a O

from O

such O
as O

We O
intentionally O

how O

On O
the O

# O
34;Con&#34 O
; O
side O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
upper O
compartment O
would O
have O
greatly O
benefited O
from O
some O
velcro O
material O
to O
be O
able O
to O
build O
some O
compartments O
for O
additional O
equipment O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
, O
it O
would O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
pull O
it O
out O
. O

; O
The O
advertised O
list O
price O
is O
excessively O
overpriced O
, O
but O
a O
good O
discount O
makes O
this O
more O
competitively O
priced O
with O
other O
competing O
laptop O
pads/ O

This O
is O
a O
real O
powerhouse O
with O
the O
top O
AMD O
processor O
, O
amazing O
clarity O
HD O
screen O
, O
and O
hyped O
- O
up O
HD O
audio O
. O

I O
love O
all O
of O
the O
features O
plus O
I O
walk O
down O
five O
sets O
of O
stairs O
where O
i O
go O
to O
school O
. O

One O
has O
a O
spring O
, O
which O
is O
gray O
, O
I O
guess O
to O
simulate O
a O
paint O
brush O
. O

I O
had O
n't O
used O
it O
on O
anything O
larger O
yet O
. O

To O
control O
the O
heat O
, O
the O
fans O
are O
kicking O
in O
quite O
frequently O
resulting O
in O
higher O
noise O
. O

I O
wasted O
a O
lot O
of O
hours O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
now O
they O
want O
me O
to O
ship O
laptop O
to O
them O
they O
say O
it O
may O
take O
2 O
weeks O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

Nothing O
a O
piece O
of O
duct O
tape O
wo O
n't O
fix O
, O
but O
it O
's O
still O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hassle O
. O

Most O
Bluetooth O
features O
do O
not O
work O
with O
the O
cable O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
uncommon O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
the O
most O
comfortable O
mouse O
for O
large O
hands O
. O

Sound O
is O
good O
, O
too O
. O

The O
comfort O
of O
this O
cooler O
while O
I O
hold O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
and O
work O
on O
my O
netbook O
is O
incomparable O
to O
the O
competition O
. O

They O
use O
this O
power O
supply O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
computers O
but O
it O
worked O
perfectly O
on O
my O
Alienware O
M14x O
R2 O
. O

The O
size O
it O
great O
for O
those O
who O
travel O
. O

It O
's O
an O
adaptor O
, O
it O
works O
as O
it O
should O
and O
best O
of O
all O

It O
's O
3 O
bucks O
people O
! O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
the O
padding O
inside O
is O
red O
and O
might O
stain O
a O
white O
computer O
. O

Worked O
perfect O
to O
transfer O
my O
laptops O

a O
new O
Crucial O

mSATA O
Internal O
Solid O
State O
Drive O
using O
Reflect O
software O
and O
replace O
the O
old O
, O
smaller O
SSD O
. O

For O
common O
uses O
it O
makes O
the O
job O
, O
but O
have O
in O
mind O
that O
even O
when O
they O
advertise O
30 O
ft O
range O
( O
not O
just O
this O
adapter O
, O
but O
all O
) O
it O
is O
really O
compromised O
on O
real O
life O
ambience O
. O

After O
reading O
so O
many O
negative O
recent O
reviews O
, O
I O
felt O
compelled O
to O
come O
back O
and O
update O
. O

Got O
the O

one O
, O
everything O
was O
perfect O

for O
a O
week O
or O
so O
. O

Performance O
wise O
, O
this O
works O
exactly O
as O
expected O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
connections O
would O
be O
completely O
unacceptable O
for O

form O

it O

which O
are O

so O
it O
does O
n't O
stick O
out O
when O
it O
's O
installed O
which O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
wanted O
. O

u O
( O
i O
never O
untied O
the O
cord O
from O
it O

twisty O
) O
. O

The O
sound O
does O
n't O
sound O
degraded O
at O
all O
and O
the O
wires O
are O
thicker O
than O
you O
would O
think O
for O
the O
price O
. O

It O
worked O
great O

Only O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
4 O
stars O
is O
because O
installing O
windows O
XP O
was O
not O
as O
problem O
free O
. O

Plus O
, O
needed O
a O
bag O
to O
hold O
the O
charger O
as O
the O
battery O
does O
n't O
last O
as O
long O
anymore O
as O
it O
used O
to O
. O

Received O
the O
new O
battery O
, O
thought O
at O
first O
it O
looked O
too O
small O
to O
fit O
my O
laptop O
, O
but O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O

Maybe O
my O
HP O
laptops O
just O
have O
poor O
battery O
life O
, O
but O
I O
am O
astounded O
everytime O

I O
have O
ordered O
another O
type O
and O
will O
be O
using O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
arrives O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
USB O
cable O
is O
longer O
and O
easily O
reaches O
any O
port O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

The O
keyboard O
was O
just O
too O
small O
and O
difficult O
to O
type O
on O
. O

It O
uncouples O
quite O
easy O
with O
some O
cell O
phones O
. O

At O
30 O
- O
60 O
dollars O
a O
dock O
it O
gets O
very O
expensive O
, O
especially O
with O
as O
many O
cell O
phones O
I O
go O
through O

I O
have O
a O
15 O
in O
laptop O
and O
got O
this O
size O
bag O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
my O

to O
be O
too O
fitted O
; O
i O
just O
wanted O
a O
little O
wiggle O

I O
needed O
a O
bag O
for O
carry O
on O
purposes O
that O
I O
could O
also O
use O
while O
doing O
day O
hikes O
, O
take O
to O
the O
office O
, O
etc O
. O

Bought O
several O
as O
needed O
them O
for O
the O
business O
and O
have O
used O
them O
in O
the O
past O
with O
great O
success O
. O

This O
item O
worked O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
, O
then O
issues O
. O

so O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
mouse O
separately O
. O

I O
must O
have O
owned O
dozens O
of O
wireless O
adapters O
and O
routers O
of O
all O
kinds O
since O
I O
got O
my O
first O
wifi O
equipment O
about O
1998 O
. O

Whatever O
type O
monitor O
connection O
you O
need O
, O
you O
'll O
find O
it O
included O
. O

from O
a O
price O
prospective O
it O
is O
a O
better O
option O
that O
buying O
one O
screw O
for O
$ O

$ O

I O
will O
always O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
Windows O
machines O
because O
they O
can O
not O
be O
used O
worry O
- O
free O
out O
of O
the O
box O
-- O
countermeasures O
are O
a O
MUST O

Definitely O
the O
perfect O
backpack O
for O
traveling O
with O
your O
pro O
DSLR O
. O

I O
was O
just O
playing O
around O
.......... O

There O
are O
only O
two O
things O
I O
do O
not O
like O
about O
it O
. O

It O
crashed O
within O
30 O
days O
and O
go O
figure O
; O
that O
is O
the O
length O
of O
time O
that O
it O
is O
covered O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
budget O
- O
friendly O
item O
that O
just O
works O
. O

For O
movies O
, O
etc O
, O
I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
landscape O
stand O
. O

Oh O
well O
. O

The O
outlets O
are O
moderately O
spaced O
, O
not O
too O
spacious O
nor O
congested O
. O

Well O
done O
sirs O
. O

The O
usb O
cord O
is O
serves O
both O
as O
power O
supply O
and O
data O
connection O
. O

I O
'm O
surprised O
anyone O
would O
buy O
the O
HA O
as O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
Bluetooth O
or O
b O
/ O
g O
/ O
n O
connectivity O
. O

Longer O
cable O
is O
great O
. O

I O
've O
used O
web O
- O
based O
video O
and O
GFX O
editors O
, O
and O
they O
are O
n't O
as O
good O
as O
stuff O
like O
iMovie O
, O
Windows O
Movie O
Maker O
, O
Photoshop O
, O
or O
Pixelmator O
. O

Chances O
are O
, O
if O
your O
laptop O
has O
3 O
audio O
jacks O
you O
should O
be O
ok O
, O
and O
if O
it O
only O
has O
2 O
then O
this O
might O
not O
work O
for O
you O
. O

its O
mobileIt O
sounds O
good O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
any O
artwork O
you O
may O
see O
with O
this O
product O
, O
the O
one O
I O
got O
is O
very O
small O
- O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
the O
correct O
size O

and O
it O
originally O
came O
with O
3 O
gb O
because O
I O
bought O
it O
refurbished O

Sometimes O
a O
reboot O
will O
be O
necessary O
. O

Works O
perfect O
for O
my O
Raspberry O
Pi O
. O

What O
a O
quality O
product O
- O
attention O
to O
detail O
, O
well O
padded O
, O
spacious O
& O
versatile O
... O
with O
a O
small O
footprint O
. O

And O
the O
second O
reason O
for O
the O
trouble O
is O
that O
the O
station O
's O
receptacle O
is O
almost O
always O
just O
a O
tad O
too O
low O
for O
it O
to O
snuggly O
fit O
into O
the O
hard O
drive O
's O
plug O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
buying O
Yamaha O
's O
UX16 O
and O
did O
n't O
experience O
any O
of O
the O
above O
issues O
. O

The O
LCD O
screen O
although O
small O
is O
very O
viewable O
with O
much O
less O
fading O
out O
from O
an O
angle O
than O
many O
other O
laptops O
. O

I O
will O
do O
video O
capture O
and O
processing O
on O
this O
and O
will O
like O
to O
see O
its O
performance O
then O
. O

I O
just O
cloned O
my O
laptop O
hard O
drive O
to O
this O
drive O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
WOW O
. O

I O
should O
not O
have O
to O
do O
a O
full O
restore O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
computer O
to O
make O
it O
work O
properly O
. O

Oh O
and O
by O
the O
way O
if O
this O
laptop O
shuts O
on O
you O
and O
black O
screens O
and O
never O
lets O
you O
on O
, O
there O
is O
a O
fix O
, O
just O
shut O
the O
computer O
down O
, O
take O
out O
the O
battery O
, O
hold O
down O
the O
power O
button O
for O
30 O
seconds O
and O
then O
release O

Obviously O
this O
is O
impossible O
to O
deal O
with O
while O
drawing O
because O
my O
line O
goes O
way O
past O
where O
I O
wanted O
to O
stop O
. O

The O
outside O
flap O
form O
- O
fits O
to O
close O
the O
top O
, O
which O
keeps O
stuff O
from O
sticking O
out O
though O
it O
also O
puts O
a O
hard O
stop O
on O
the O
maximum O
you O
can O
put O
into O
the O
bag O
. O

I O
purchased O
a O
Korean O
27&#34 O
; O
IPS O
monitor O
with O
2560x1440 O
resolution O
for O
about O
$ O
365 O
on O
eBay O
with O
2560x1440 O
resolution O
and O
was O
happy O
with O
it O
except O
that O
the O
power O
supply O
died O
after O
a O
year O
and O
the O
monitor O
started O
flickering O
after O
two O
years O
. O

It O
has O
made O
a O
world O
of O
difference O
and O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
me O
to O
use O
my O
computer O
again O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
netbook O
and O
works O
great O
. O

Piece O
of O
junk O
- O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
fiddle O
with O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
AC O
Adapter O
to O
use O
with O
my O
new O
HP O
M6 O
1225DX O
Laptop O
. O

I O
have O
not O
upgraded O
to O
Windows O
8 O
. O
1 O

I O
was O
n't O
expecting O
much O
when O
I O
ordered O
this O
card O
, O
but O
once O
I O
received O
it O

The O
2 O
year O
warranty O
is O
a O
+ O

Toshiba O
is O
not O
one O
of O
them O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
bag O
as O
a O
Father O
Day O
Gift O
for O
my O
husband O
. O

I O
'm O
running O
an O
AppleTV O
, O
HTPC O
, O
OUYA O
and O
Amazon O
TV O
with O
XBMC O
side O
loaded O
and O

The O
power O
adaptor O
outputs O
a O
non O
- O
standard O
voltage O
: O

The O
screen O
and O
speakers O
are O
not O
very O
high O
quality O
, O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Compare O
the O
products O
and O
see O
which O
ones O
suits O
your O
internet O
connection O
, O
your O
computer O
's O
software O
and O
hardware O
.. O
and O
your O
budget O
! O

The O
Intell O
SSD O
dramatically O
speeds O
up O
boot O
time O
. O

The O
unit O
was O
doa O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
close O
to O
be O
the O
solution O
for O
that O
. O

Just O
a O
week O
ago O
, O
I O
got O
a O
job O
with O
Eye O
- O
Fi O
Technical O
Support O
and O
was O
about O
ready O
to O
bring O
the O
Linksys O
G O
back O
up O
when O
I O
got O
the O
e O
- O
mail O
from O
Amazon O
that O
there O
were O
only O
2 O
of O
these O
babies O
left O
, O
so O
I O
snatched O
one O
up O
. O

It O
has O
a O
solid O
outer O
case O
and O
a O
dust O
cover O
for O
the O
ports O
, O
it O
works O
and O
is O
simple O
.... O

therefore O
it O
IS O
a O
pass O
through O
USB O
. O

I O
felt O
initially O
that O
I O
could O
keep O
it O
in O
my O
backpack O
which O
has O
a O
padded O
section O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

All O
metal O
design O
, O
sleek O
and O
light O
. O

You O
have O
to O
convert O
720p O
MKV O

Would O
buy O
again O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I O
have O
not O
totally O
switched O
over O
to O
Mac O
is O
, O
there O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
Mac O
version O
of O
MS O
Money O
or O
any O
nice O
financial O
software O
for O
the O
Mac O
. O

Because O
it O
comes O
with O
an O
AC O
adapter O

The O
bag O
itself O
is O
padded O
so O
thinly O
that O
I O
would O
never O
trust O
this O
bag O
to O
anything O
but O
graceful O
movements O
, O
as O
a O
simple O
bump O
riding O
the O
train O
seems O
like O
it O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
the O
bag O
to O
handle O
. O

This O
is O
the O
biggest O
laptop O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
was O
not O
expecting O
much O
due O
to O
the O
price O
, O
but O
was O
happy O
when O
it O
came O
as O
it O
was O
a O
good O
quality O
product O
. O

Bought O
one O
ArmorSuit O
MilitaryShield O
and O
one O
Zagg O
's O
screen O
protector O
( O
HD O
version O
) O
. O

There O
is O
not O
enough O
strength O
to O
keep O
the O
item O
in O
place O
. O

6 O
inch O
Dell O
Inspiron O
15 O
and O
wanted O
something O
padded O
and O
lightweight O
with O
handles O
. O

I O
am O
using O
this O
for O
the O
Canon O
EF O
85 O
mm O
f O
1 O
. O
8 O
that O
is O
attached O
to O
a O
T2i O

If O
this O
laptop O
came O
with O
Vista O
, O
I O
'd O
hate O
it O
even O
worse O
. O

If O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
typing O
, O
which O
for O
me O
, O
is O
12 O
to O
16 O
hours O
a O
day O
computer O
use O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
bought O
two O
MacBook O
Airs O
the O
other O
day O
, O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
ensure O
that O
they O
would O
n't O
get O
scratched O
, O
as O
well O
as O
being O
able O
to O
tell O
them O
apart O

again."And O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
happened O
. O

True O
, O
the O
graphics O
are O
not O
the O
best O
, O
but O
hardware O
1080p O
decoding O
is O
there O
, O
and O
since O
it O
has O
been O
the O
mainstream O
for O
larger O
notebooks O
, O
the O
drivers O
are O
mature O
and O
stable O
, O
good O
for O
running O
Windows O
or O
Linux O
, O
or O
even O
MacOS O
( O
? O
) O

This O
does O
have O
a O
strong O
aroma O
when O
it O
comes O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
it O
finally O
airs O
out O
. O

All O
things O
minor O
, O
but O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

However O
, O
I O
love O
the O
hardware O
Apple O
produces O
. O

Works O
very O
well O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
watched O
the O
service O
person O
working O
on O
my O
computer O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
all O
he O
did O
was O
run O
the O
necessary O
programs O
. O

Totally O
uncool O
! O

It O
is O
great O
case O
! O

And O
I O
wo O
n't O
even O
mention O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
machine O
itself O
or O
even O
the O
attention O
to O
details O
in O
the O
packaging O
of O
the O
unit O
. O

The O
external O
drives O
were O
recognized O
immediately O
and O
icons O
pop O
up O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
screen O
to O
inform O
you O
that O
an O
external O
hard O
drive O
has O
been O
plugged O
in O
. O

this O
is O
freakin O
awesome O
.... O
didnt O
have O
to O
do O
much O
but O
charge O
and O
cut O
on O
and O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
move O
my O
computer O
to O
plug O
in O
a O
USB O
. O

I O
have O
to O
remember O
Its O
not O
a O
stereo O
... O

but O
transaction O
speed O
and O
limit O
is O
very O
less O
, O
very O
slow O
transaction O
. O

The O
whole O
installation O
process O
takes O
under O
two O
minutes O
. O

so O
I O
decided O
to O
keep O
it O
instad O
of O
returning O
it O
after O
having O
it O
engraved O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
have O
to O
delete O
the O
device O
from O
the O
iPhone O
and O
allow O
it O
to O
pair O
as O
if O
initially O
. O

Video O
- O
Hulu O
seemed O
a O
little O
choppy O
, O
but O
YouTube O
was O
fine O
. O

This O
was O
ordered O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
a O
lost O
power O
supply O
. O

To O
be O
clear O
, O
my O
disappointment O
is O
all O
about O
the O
midrange O
and O
highs O
. O

Although O
you O
can O
use O
it O
with O
the O
this O
dock O
, O
you O
have O
no O
room O
for O
error O
, O
and O
makes O
assembly O
a O
bit O
difficult O
. O

This O
antenna O
does O
it O
quite O
well O
. O

For O
the O
past O
week O
I O
've O
used O
this O
speaker O
to O
play O
audiobooks O
during O
my O
2 O
hours O
of O
daily O
commute O
- O
the O
audio O
quality O
is O
plenty O
loud O
to O
hear O
quiet O
moments O
of O
dialogue O
even O
with O
highway O
road O
noise O
in O
the O
background O
and O
after O
5 O
days O
of O
usage O
( O
10 O
+ O
hours O
) O
finally O
gave O
it O
re O
- O
charge O
. O

The O
Velcro O
compartment O
dividers O
are O
hard O
to O
rip O
out O
and O
put O
back O
in O
. O

Originally O
it O
was O
on O
and O
off O
and O
on O
and O
off O
constantly O
, O

Wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
all O
worked O
. O

The O
Bluetooth O
is O
great O
but O
the O
sound O
of O
this O
speaker O
is O
just O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

You O
have O
tons O
of O
compartments O
to O
organize O
exactly O
how O
you O
want O
. O

It O
does O
come O
with O
a O
shoulder O
strap O
that O
is O
n't O
sown O
in O
the O
pictures O
and O
a O
short O
handle O
you O
can O
also O
use O
. O

It O
is O
portable O
and O
functional O
and O
will O
do O
the O
job O
! O

I O
had O
gotten O
tired O
of O
my O
shoulder O
strap O
laptop O
/ O
briefcase O
and O
searched O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
modestly O
priced O
wheeled O
/ O
roller O
model O
. O

It O
gives O
you O
all O
the O
connection O
options O
you O
need O
. O

( O

and O

If O
you O
use O

in O

it O
might O
be O
wise O
to O
use O

There O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
oversight O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
design O
of O
this O
product O
when O
trying O
to O
access O
equipment O
through O
the O
side O

while O
the O
pack O
is O
positioned O
as O
a O
sling O
in O

of O
the O
wearer O
as O
recommended O
by O
the O
manufacturer O
: O
the O
pack O
opening O
closes O
up O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
equipment O
because O
it O
in O
essence O
forms O
a O
hammock O
with O
all O
of O
the O
weight O
being O
supported O
by O
just O
two O
straps O
attached O
diagonally O

Overall O
, O
I O
got O
exactly O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
and O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

This O
is O
a O
well O
made O
, O
nicely O
designed O
NETBOOK O

. O

The O
product O
is O
shipped O
decently O
packaged O
but O
there O
's O
nothing O
in O
there O
that O
ca O
n't O
handle O
a O
little O
rough O
and O
tumble O
anyway O
. O

The O
160 O
GB O
SDD O
had O
twice O
the O
capacity O
, O
ran O
cooler O
and O
faster O
and O
gave O
my O
old O
laptop O
a O
new O
look O
on O
life O
. O

saver O
or O
when O
the O
monitor O
is O
first O
turned O
on O
. O

I O
work O
off O
of O
my O
bed O
a O
lot O
and O
because O
of O
that O
, O
my O
fan O
gets O
blocked O
. O

The O
LED O
screen O
is O
far O
more O
susceptible O
to O
what O

you O
are O
viewing O
it O
from O

This O
is O
an O
effortless O
laptop O
to O
operate O
. O

I O
had O
a O
battery O
that O
would O
n't O
charge O
any O
longer O
. O

Everything O
looked O
okay O
, O
except O
as O
I O
checked O
things O
out O
further O
, O
I O
discovered O
that O
I O
had O
lost O
all O
of O
my O
files O
! O

If O
you O
're O
serious O
about O
video O
creation O
, O
then O
you O
'll O
probably O
need O
to O
buy O
third O
- O
party O
software O
, O
though O
the O
stuff O
that O
comes O
with O
vista O
( O
movie O
maker O
) O
and O
a O
mac O
( O
imovie O
) O
are O
both O
supposed O
to O
be O
great O
for O
basic O
stuff O
. O

My O
son O
has O
an O
Asus O
netbook O
and O
the O
cat O
chewed O
the O
cord O
on O
his O
power O
adapter O
. O

This O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
for O
movies O
with O
a O
2 O
. O
35 O
aspect O
ratio O
. O

This O
means O
i O
would O
be O
paying O
two O
shipping O
charges O
for O
something O
that O
should O
've O
been O
working O
properly O
in O
the O

If O
my O
battery O
is O
getting O
low O
as O
I O
'm O
running O
out O
the O

, O
no O
problem O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
're O
using O
a O
2 O

1 O

device O
, O
or O
better O
, O
you O
definitely O
want O
this O
cable O
! O

( O

) O
. O

The O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
only O
4 O
stars O
& O
not O
5 O
. O

The O
build O
quality O
is O
tops O
. O

This O
keyboard O
was O
easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
actually O
was O
better O
than O
the O
original O
. O

Also O
, O
and O
this O
was O
very O
important O
to O
me O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
removable O
shoulder O
strap O
. O

It O
's O
more O
versatile O
than O
my O
professional O
laptop O
computer O
bag O
( O
which O
I O
pack O
in O
my O
suitcase O
) O
. O

that O
s O
because O
of O
new O
intel O
chip O
, O
if O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
bad O
screen O
, O
this O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
laptopI O
was O
surprised O
that O
i O
was O
able O
to O
play O
hight O
quality O
HD O
60fps O
video O
without O
any O
problemsmy O
4 O
years O
old O

It O
's O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
the O
extra O
2 O
. O
5 O
" O
drives O
I O
have O
lying O
around O
. O

Some O
complain O
about O
battery O
life O

, O
I O
like O
the O
form O
factor O
, O
the O
design O
is O
niceI O
will O
give O
it O
a O
4 O
star O
because O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
in O
guiding O
me O
to O
get O
it O
up O
and O
running O
from O
its O
directional O
manualI O

Works O
very O
well O
. O

; O
This O
bag O
is O
subtle O
and O
low O
key O
enough O
that O
people O
think O
nothing O
of O
it O

It O
had O
good O
range O
. O

I O
want O
to O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
Cinematographers O
, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
great O
for O
editing O
and O
postproduction O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
drive O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fantastic O
deal O
. O

Either O
it O
works O
or O
it O
does O
n't O
. O

There O
are O
TONS O
of O
picture O
tweaking O
options O
in O
the O
Menu O
, O
but O
the O
TV O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
box O
perfect O
. O

I O
got O
these O
so O
I O
could O
actually O
HEAR O
what O
's O
going O
on O
when O
I O
watch O
my O
shows O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
! O
! O
! O

( O
in O
the O
photos O
above O
) O
holds O
a O
external O
Hard O
Drive O
and O
the O
USB O
wire O
for O
it O
... O

The O
main O
issue O
I O
have O
is O
that O
the O
area O
where O
you O
can O
install O
msata O
ssd O
is O
not O
actively O
cooled O
. O

Back O
to O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for;Basically O
, O
I O
wanted O
a O
MacBook O
but O
only O
had O
about O
five O
hundred O
bucks O
to O
spend O
. O

That O
you O
can O
get O
X O
amount O
of O
hours O
on O
a O
60 O
GB O
HDD O
, O
whereas O
you O
only O
get O
X O
amount O
on O
a O
16 O
GB O
Flash O
. O

It O
ca O
n't O
even O
handle O
my O
keyboard O
/ O
mouse O
with O
two O
of O
the O
four O
slots O
open O
. O

If O
it O
helps O
, O
I O
bought O
it O
from O
the O
retailer O
named O
HDE O
. O

Very O
solid O
and O
perfectly O
assembled O
. O

This O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
Dell O
battery O
, O
and O
it O
's O
lasted O
less O
than O
4 O
months O
. O

and O
it O
did O
n't O
even O
work O
at O
all O
. O

In O
use O
I O
discovered O
the O
following O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
keyboard O
works O
because O
the O
wire O
to O
connect O
it O
with O
has O
a O
full O
sized O
USB O
end O
on O
it O
instead O
of O
a O
mini O
USB O
. O

Another O
bonus O
: O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
On O
Tour O
system O
made O
it O
easy O
to O
hang O
it O
off O
the O
side O
of O
my O
night O
stand O
, O

That O
would O
even O
work O
as O
a O
pillow!&#34 O
; O
My O
computer O
is O
going O
to O
be O
safe O
IN O
THERE O
. O

Keep O
doing O
this O
until O
all O
the O
software O
is O
updated O
and O
it O
is O
recommended O
to O
continue O
to O
check O
every O
month O
or O
so O
as O
well O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
just O
tried O
to O
edit O
some O
footage O
. O

Note O
, O
my O
laptop O
that O
has O
an O
integrated O
card O
connects O
to O
the O
wireless O
network O
just O
fine O
and O
does O
n't O
disconnect O
, O
so O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
adapter O
. O

i O
can O
hold O
my O
Inspiron O
laptop O
, O
iPad O
, O
a O
few O
notepads O
and O
books O
, O
as O
well O
as O
my O
wallet O
, O
phone O
, O
and O
other O
travel O
documents O
. O

So O
I O
read O
the O
fantastic O
reviews O
on O
this O
model O
and O
noticed O
it O
was O
using O
an O
upgraded O
APU O
processor O

I O
tend O
to O
use O
Vista O
for O
photo O
editing O
and O
Mac O
for O
video O
. O

Snug O
fit O
. O

No O
bells O
or O
whistles O
, O
just O
a O
good O
basic O
PCI O
card O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
with O
constantly O
" O
on O
" O
connecting O
to O
AC O
power O
. O

USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
is O
awesome O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
the O
unit O
would O
work O
in O
the O
basement O
, O
so O

Having O
a O
toddler O
, O
my O
husband O

So O
one O
day O
, O
I O
found O
out O
I O
needed O
a O
new O
bag O
. O

Really O
protects O
my O
prized O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Not O
a O
bad O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
but O
useless O

Very O
quiet O
with O
a O
low O
pleasant O
hum O
sound O
coming O
from O
the O
fans O
. O

I O
'll O
probably O
order O
another O
one O
as O
a O
back O
up O
if O
( O
or O
when O
likely O
) O
this O
first O
one O
does O
go O
out O
. O

Is O
it O
the O
SSD O
primarily O
? O

But O
I O
can O
imagine O
some O
folks O
would O
prefer O
this O
kind O
of O
layout O
( O
very O
similar O
to O
Macbook).Having O
the O
optical O
drive O
definitely O
came O
in O
handy O
for O
installing O
some O
software O
. O

The O
top O
clip O
, O
which O
is O
spring O
loaded O
, O
does O
not O
catch O
the O
top O
edge O
of O
the O
tablet O
. O

. O
. O
in O
a O
good O
way O
! O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
size O
to O
take O
to O
a O
meeting O
and O
holds O
everything O
I O
need O
. O

This O
one O
was O
a O
welcome O
improvement O
over O
it O
. O

I O
concur O
with O
all O
the O
other O
comments O
stating O
that O
the O
wifi O
on O
this O
thing O
is O
the O
most O
frustrating O
I O
've O
ever O
experienced O
on O
a O
notebook O
( O
and O
the O
Series O
9 O
was O
not O
good O
either O
, O
since O
it O
was O
encased O
in O
aluminum O
) O
. O

I O
just O
wish O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
them O
. O

Not O
at O
all O
what O
the O
description O
said O
. O

The O
monitor O
itself O
it O
huge O
. O

For O
under O
20 O
bucks O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
little O
device O
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
there O
simply O
is O
n't O
ANY O
reason O
to O
buy O
this O
older O
model O
, O
which O
runs O
a O
lot O
more O
sluggishly O
, O
unless O
you O
can O
get O
it O
for O
a O
song-- O

I O
bought O
the O
Brinks O
version O
at O
Walmart O
for O
less O
then O
$ O
7 O
. O

I O
am O
detailed O
about O
this O
because O
many O
seem O
to O
have O
complained O
the O
cord O
breaks O
. O

Sony O
loses O
points O
, O
though O
, O
on O
the O
way O
they O
package O
this O
nice O
( O
and O
expensive O
! O
) O

Now O
I O
have O
an O
ultrabook O
which O
rivals O
any O
$ O
1200 O
4th O
- O
gen O
ultrabooks O
out O
there O
except O
screen O
resolution O
. O

It O
's O
ergonomically O
pleasant O
so O
far O
. O

I O
have O
Verizon O
FIOS O
and O
my O
speedtest O
results O

I O
have O
a O
$ O
2000 O
desktop O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
another O
PC O
that O
is O
a O
headache O
to O
maintain O
with O
antivirus O
, O
updating O
, O
and O
installing O
programs O
. O

It O
goes O
away O

The O
main O
thing O
about O
this O
little O
computer O
is O
that O
it O
is O
truly O
portable O
. O

My O
ipad O
will O
be O
scratched O
up O
in O
no O
time O
. O

The O
zippers O
work O
fine O
and O
the O
handles O
are O
padded O
. O

I O
commute O
back O
and O
forth O
from O
work O
and O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
smaller O
sized O
pack O
that O
would O
also O
hold O
my O
iPad O
, O
other O
electronic O
items O
and O
my O
lunch O
. O

and O
unfortunately O
it O
did O
not O
make O
any O
difference O
. O

This O
thing O
installed O
quick O
and O
easy O
, O
It O
works O
from O
one O
side O
of O
the O
house O
and O
starts O
to O
cut O
out O
with O
my O
headphones O
at O
the O
front O
door O
at O
the O
other O
. O

This O
cord O
powers O
my O
laptop O
, O
but O
after O
extended O
use O
it O
becomes O
quite O
hot O
to O
the O
touch O
. O

Instead O
, O
it O
's O
one O
unit O
, O
with O
about O
8 O
drivers O
... O
a O
VGA O
driver O
, O
a O
USB O
driver O
, O
etc O
. O

Will O
see O
how O
long O
it O
lasts O
this O
time O
. O

Do O
nt O
relay O
on O
Amazon O
's O
3rd O
party O
sellers O

The O
richness O
of O
Wagner O
's O
Tannhauser O
, O
Rachmoninoff O
's O
Piano O
Con O
. O

They O
assigned O
a O
case O
manager O
since O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
ship O
the O
PC O
back O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
fan O
I O
never O
heard O
it O
and O
the O
SSD O
is O
quiet O
since O
it O
has O
no O
moving O
parts O
. O

Essentially O
, O
you O
can O
have O
both O
a O
portable O
hard O
drive O
and O
a O
power O
supply O
inside O
this O
while O
working O
on O
the O
laptop O
... O
this O
is O
a O
nifty O
design O
for O
both O
at O
home O
or O
office O
use O
to O
save O
desk O
space O
and O
for O
on O
the O
go O
use O
where O
you O
may O
have O
limited O
space O
or O
an O
uneven O
work O
area O
. O

This O
one O
looks O
extremely O
cheap O
. O

There O
is O
a O
slight O
magnet O
in O
the O
case O
which O
keeps O
it O
closed O
instead O
of O
flopping O
open O
( O
but O
I O
must O
note O
that O
the O
magnet O
does O
NOT O
turn O
the O
iPad O
on O
or O
off O
) O
. O

, O
first O
you O
can O
not O
sit O
at O
a O
table O
because O
you O
got O
yuppie O
mellenials O
sitting O
there O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
go O
outside O
and O
the O
signal O
sucks O
, O
but O
with O
this O
you O
can O
get O
to O
be O
& O
# O
34;first O
in O
line&#34 O
; O
on O
data O
signal O
, O
even O
if O
you O
are O
30 O
feet O
away O
and O
outside O
..... O
so O
it O
works O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
it O
could O
break O
on O
me O
if O
I O
was O
n't O
careful O
with O
it O
. O

The O
price O
is O
good O
, O
construction O
is O
good O
, O
however O
the O
layout O
could O
have O
been O
better O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
buy O
for O
the O
price O
. O

I O
have O
one O
of O
the O
starter O
batteries O
from O
my O
other O
Panny O
that O
fits O
the O
HCM O
40 O

OK O
now O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
despite O
the O
above O
list O
, O
I O
LOVE O
this O
laptop O
. O

However O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
smelling O
like O
it O
does O
. O

So O
I O
lose O
the O
optical O
drive O
for O
the O
same O
battery O
life O
. O

So O
I O
plugged O
it O
in O
and O
tested O
it O
with O
a O
dummy O
load O
and O
a O
multimeter O
and O
it O
gives O
5amps O
as O
rated O
. O

The O
laptop O
itself O
is O
very O
rugged O
and O
durable O
, O
but O
again O
a O
newer O
laptop O
running O
XP O
should O
perform O
alot O
better O
. O

So O
I O
now O
have O
2 O
identical O
monitors O
out O
of O
a O
set O
of O
3 O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
. O

I O
'm O
definitely O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
. O

but O
it O
does O
well O
otherwise O

The O
only O
media O
output O
peripheral O
is O
the O
new O
MiniDisplay O
port O
which O
with O
the O
right O
adapter O
can O
link O
with O
DVI O
, O
HDMI O
or O
digital O
VGA O
but O
not O
S O
- O
video O
. O

was O
that O
I O
needed O
a O
good O
mouse O
that O
worked O
with O
windows O
8 O
. O

Decided O
to O
try O
a O
recording O
so O
clicked O
EPG O
& O
# O
8211 O
; O
which O
is O
the O
ATSC O
Electronic O
Program O
Guide O
. O

I O
have O
since O
downloaded O
and O
installed O
Firefox O
and O
Safari O
. O

I O
took O
it O
with O
me O
when O
we O
went O
wake O
boarding O
on O
our O
270HP O
Yamaha O
jet O
boat O
, O
the O
boat O
engines O
only O
drown O
out O
the O
speaker O
when O
at O
full O
throttle O
. O

The O
FSP O
Aurum O
is O
a O
400 O
Watt O
power O
supply O
and O
supplies O
18 O
Amps O
on O
a O
single O
12v O
rail O
, O
but O
has O
two O
12v O
rails O
for O
a O
combined O
36 O
Amps O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
pad O
thinking O
that O
my O
laptop O
was O
overheating O
since O
it O
kept O
on O
rebooting O
and O
freezing O
randomly O
. O

Spray O
and O
towel O
dry O
( O
do O
nt O
need O
to O
be O
dry O
, O
just O
clean).2 O
) O
spray O
your O
fingers O
so O
you O
do O
nt O
leave O
finger O
prints O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

I O
can O
use O
the O
AUX O
on O
back O
and O
it O
plays O
fine O
, O
but O
it O
loses O
some O
of O
that O
power O

The O
bag O
was O
strong O
and O
stood O
up O
to O
some O
rough O
usage O
. O

I O
solved O
the O
problem O
quickly O
through O
some O
simple O
pre O
- O
ordered O
research O
and O
just O
reformatted O
the O
Hard O
- O
drive O
into O
one O
Partition O
and O
reloaded O
windows O
and O
then O
reload O
the O
Drivers O
and O
skipped O
the O
bloatware O
. O

This O
is O
unusual O
but O
potentially O
very O
useful O
for O
making O
stereo O
recordings O
direct O
to O
a O
laptop O
/ O
PC O
. O

Since O
it O
has O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
capability O
it O
gives O
me O
additional O
function O
that O
my O
old O
laptop O
does O
not O
have O
. O

Generic O
Docking O
stations O
for O
Windows O
7 O
notebooks O
are O
not O
the O
easiest O
to O
come O
by O
. O

I O
guess O
I O
will O
just O
start O
with O
the O
mouse O
pad O
( O
which O
has O
already O
messed O
me O
up O
about O
3 O
times O
since O
I O
started O
writing O
this O
review O
) O
. O

The O
back O
pocket O
easily O
fits O
an O
Ipad O
or O
notebook O
and O
magazines O
or O
other O
items O
. O

I O
do O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
pouch O
for O
the O
power O
adapter O
and O
my O
mouse O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
I O
probably O
would O
n't O
use O
it O
anyway O
since O
that O
would O
make O
it O
too O
bulky O
to O
put O
in O
my O
backpack O
. O

It O
might O
get O
little O
easier O
when O
used O
for O
a O
longer O
time O

3-dimensional O
masks O
or O
a O
hats O
on O
your O
head O
-- O
and O
they O
actually O
swivel O
in O
3-d O
space O
, O
too O
! O

I O
can O
fit O
a O
whole O
heck O
of O
a O
lot O
into O
this O
backpack O
, O
and O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
become O
my O
daily O
man O
- O
purse O
where O
I O
store O
all O
kinds O
of O
things O
: O
my O
laptop O
for O
work O
, O
a O
spare O
set O
of O
gym O
clothes O
and O
a O
rolled O
- O
up O
towel O
, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
extra O
pens O
, O
keys O
, O
and O
thing O
- O
a O
- O
ma O
- O
bobs O
that O
I O
seem O
to O
need O
all O
the O
darn O
time O
. O

It O
's O
very O
small O
and O
lightweight O
, O
battery O
powered O
, O
easy O
to O
operate O
, O
and O
has O
a O
two O
- O
position O
bass O
boost O
switch O
. O

This O
is O
also O
my O
4th O
HP O
and O
my O
previous O
ones O
had O
AMD O
chips O
also O
. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
battery O
at O
good O
price O
. O

It O
is O
engineered O
with O
great O
precision O
to O
allow O
no O
movement O
of O
the O
drive O
, O
has O
great O
padding O
, O
and O
is O
as O
tight O
as O
a O
drum O
against O
dust O
. O

mine O
broke O
after O
2 O
or O
3 O
months O
. O

It O
was O
hardly O
" O
plug O
and O
play O
" O
as O
is O
Apple O
's O
reputation O
- O
probably O
works O
better O
on O
a O
Mac O
( O
I O
kept O
getting O
a O
" O
-4 O
param O
error O
code O
" O
) O
. O

On O
the O
series O
7 O
I O
got O
horrible O
battery O
life O

this O
is O
4 O
- O
1 O
reader O
, O
I O
think O
which O
is O
enough.*Enough O
ports O
: O

I O
downloaded O
the O
full O
Logitech O
Webcam O
software O
package O
and O
the O
video O
quality O
within O
that O
application O
was O
very O
nice O
. O

The O
Bluetooth O
it O
self O
does O
n't O
look O
cheap O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O

Turns O
out O
the O
drive O
was O
n't O
seated O
properly O
in O
the O
enclosure O
. O

For O
anyone O
who O
does O
n't O
know O
this O
, O
this O
is O
normal O
, O
this O
is O
the O
way O
is O
suppose O
to O
be O
, O
double O
the O
cells O
, O
double O
the O
size O
. O

This O
one O
is O
fine O
. O

one O
day O
I O
opened O
it O
and O
the O
screen O
was O
shattered O
from O
the O
top O
- O
left O
corner O
. O

This O
product O
works O
great O
, O
and O
shipped O
very O
fast O
, O
it O
works O
great O
with O
my O
ipad O
and O
laptop O
for O
cleaning O
, O
highly O
recomment O
it O
for O
your O
electronics O
. O

Interestingly O
that O
one O
had O
a O
flawed O
keyboard O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
keys O
went O
dead O
after O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
use O
, O
and O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Apple O
store O
. O

I O
actually O
would O
have O
preferred O
them O
to O
be O
shorter O
than O
advertised O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
find O
anything O
shorter O
( O
except O
the O
adapters O
that O
involve O
no O
cord O
at O
all).The O
wire O
itself O
does O
n't O
inspire O
much O
confidence O
, O
since O
it O
looks O
almost O
exactly O
like O
a O
phone O
cord O
. O

Some O
have O
plastic O
ground O
/ O
earth O
plugs O
and O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
work O
with O
all O
gadgets O
. O

but O
not O
that O
fast O
either O
. O

Upgrading O
the O
ram O
yourself O
from O
2 O
gb O
to O
4 O
gb O
is O
a O
great O
idea O
. O

It O
fits O
like O
a O
dream O
. O

I O
've O
put O
in O
my O
old O
500 O
GB O
7200 O
RPM O
HDD O
and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
dream O
, O
it O
could O
be O
even O
better O
but O
it O
is O
only O
a O
SATA O
2 O
drive O
and O
as O
such O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
able O
to O
fully O
saturate O
the O
SATA O
3 O
interface O
it O
connects O
to O
in O
the O
Y580 O
. O

With O
it O

. O

That O
previous O
computer O
had O
an O
LG O
screen O
, O
so O
I O
can O
compare O
the O
two O
. O

This O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
a O
safety O
feature O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
. O

I O
just O
received O
the O
Maxxum O
backpack O
and O
have O
found O
it O
to O
be O
perfect O
for O
my O
needs O
. O

I O
ordered O
two O
of O
these O
bad O
boys O
, O
one O
for O
the O
bathroom O
and O
one O
for O
the O
kitchen O
. O

7200 O

and O
both O
have O
136mbps O
transfer O
speed O
as O
the O
box O
says O
but O
tested O
and O
gives O
125 O
and O
sometimes O
little O
up O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
guy O
is O
svelte O
alright O
. O

6-Inch O
fits O
snuggly O
and O
appears O
well O
protected O
from O
minor O
mishaps O
. O

Also O
says O
that O
is O
compatible O
with O
the O
TF700 O
series O
and O
TF201 O
pads O
. O

When O
I O
recently O
purchased O
a O
new O
computer O
, O
I O
had O
to O
make O
hard O
decisions O
concerning O
getting O
all O
the O
hardware O
and O
features O
I O
wanted O
. O

I O
have O
been O
listening O
to O
this O
player O
for O
about O
a O
month O
now O
and O
love O
it O
! O
! O

One O
complaint O
- O

Now O
the O
cool O
part O
: O
Tested O
a O
call O
on O
the O
droid O
while O
music O
was O
playing O
. O

I O
am O
running O
Windows O
8 O
and O
quickly O
found O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
leave O
it O
plugged O
in O
when O
not O
in O
use O
. O

To O
do O
this O
the O
laptop O
must O
be O
in O
video O
output O
mode O
to O
only O
output O
video O
via O
HDMI O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
use O
it O
on O
the O
road O
in O
my O
RV O
. O

The O
HP O
always O
made O
a O
funny O
cracking O
sound O
in O
the O
hinge O
when O
I O
closed O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
fast O
CPU O
, O
the O
12 O

of O

, O
the O

my O

bit O
is O
pre O

loaded O
. O

However O
, O
when O
i O
got O
it O
I O
paired O
it O
up O
with O
my O
Galaxy O
S O
III O
. O

The O
instructions O
are O
a O
little O
vague O
on O
how O
to O
change O
frequencies O
by O
holding O
down O
which O
buttons O
but O
you O
should O
get O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
quickly O
and O
then O
it O
all O
makes O
sense O
. O

Just O
plug O
in O
the O
Data O
U. O
S. O
B. O
Plays O
music O
and O
C. O
D. O
's O
. O

There O
's O
an O
updated O
synaptics O
driver O
that O
fixes O
all O
of O
this O

I O
have O
the O
Logitech O
Y O
- O
R0023 O
Keyboard O
Case O
that O
works O
perfectly O
for O
that O
scenario O
( O
I O
fabricated O
an O
adapter O
to O
hold O
non O
- O
iPad O
devices O
to O
get O
better O
viewing O
) O
. O

I O
like O
the O
design O
of O
last O
year O
's O
equivalent O
that O
has O
these O
plugs O
under O
the O
express O
card O
slot O
. O

My O
fianc&eacute O
; O
, O
after O
checking O
the O
bag O
out O
, O
was O
hoping O
I O
'd O
give O
it O
to O
him O
since O
it O
did O
n't O
fit O
my O
computer O
perfectly O
. O

I O
have O
great O
signal O
, O
although O
I O
'm O
not O
terribly O
far O
from O
my O
router O
, O
only O
two O
rooms O
away O
. O

This O
one O
does O
not O
get O
anywhere O
near O
as O
hot O
as O
my O
previous O
replacement O
charger O
which O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

My O
headset O
that O
is O
attached O
them O
continues O
to O
work O
fine O
yet O
these O
adapters O
all O
fail O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
, O
usually O
sooner O
. O

It O
fits O
adequately O
. O

As O
with O
the O
PC O
the O
Picture O
looked O
awesome O
( O
Was O
upconverted O
to O
1080i O
) O
however O
there O
was O
no O
sound O
through O
the O
HDMI O
plug O
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
large O
and O
feels O
a O
bit O
awkward O
to O
pick O
the O
whole O
thing O
up O
with O
the O
laptop O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
it O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
you O
could O
get O
around O
that O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
have O
somewhat O
lost O
their O
touch O
over O
the O
years O
since O
the O
Audigy O
days O
we O
all O
remember O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
. O

Hope O
this O
helps O
someone O
. O

The O
blue O
lighting O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
if O
you O
enjoy O
such O
things O
- O
I O
find O
it O
beautiful O
. O

Not O
unexpected O
for O
the O
distance O
. O

the O
december O
release O
date O
was O
postponed O
due O
to O
wifi O
issues O
. O

, O
it O
is O
durable O
and O
he O
did O
not O
have O
to O
alter O
it O
at O
all O
like O
he O
did O
the O
last O
one O
to O
fit O
the O
different O
ports O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Access O
is O
quick O
with O
dual O
zippers O
with O
adequate O
tabs O
. O

There O
's O
not O
much O
to O
distinguish O
it O
from O
, O
say O
, O
a O
standard O
canvas O
tote O
bag O
with O
handles O
, O
except O
for O
a O
few O
extra O
pockets O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
metal O
frame O
keeps O
it O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
lower O
speed O
of O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
supposed O
to O
help O
battery O
life O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
fair O
trade O
off O
. O

However O
, O
lots O
of O
needed O
drivers O
were O
missing O
causing O
numerous O
crashes O
, O
BSOD O
's O
( O
Blue O
Screen O
of O
Death O
) O
reboots O
, O
and O
other O
errors O
. O

I O
use O
these O
for O
primary O
boot O
drives O
in O
fast O
tower O
computers O
but O
it O
is O
also O
ideal O
for O
a O
laptop O
as O
it O
is O
a O
2 O
. O
5 O
inch O
SSD O
and O
it O
runs O
on O
low O
power O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
things O
you O
can O
do O
for O
your O
Aspire O
One O
... O
and O
yourself O
. O

Given O
how O
great O
this O
budget O
Lenovo O
unit O
is O
, O
I O
can O
only O
imagine O
how O
great O
the O
more O
expensive O
units O
are O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
some O
of O
the O
techno O
and O
metal O
I O
was O
listening O
to O
sounded O
distorted O
at O
lower O
volumes O
, O
I O
just O
was O
n't O
impressed O
. O

Works O
well O
does O
as O
should O
. O

So O
many O
monitors O
these O
days O
max O
out O
at O
1080P O
and O
are O
marketed O
as O
" O
HD O
" O
. O

This O
little O
fan O
keeps O
my O
laptop O
cooled O
down O
and O
helps O
it O
run O
smoother O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
recommend O
this O
for O
apple O
products O
. O

an O
put O
it O
in O
this O
external O
case O
. O

I O
tried O
plugging O
it O
into O
a O
few O
different O
USB O
ports O
and O
even O
tried O
it O
on O
two O
other O
laptops O
... O

I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
i O
get O
for O
what O
I O
paid O
. O

According O
to O
injection O
molds O
' O
footprint O
, O
this O
Perlian O
1085 O
was O
made O
on O
the O
second O
week O
of O
July O
2012 O
( O
marked O
as O
2012/07/01 O
) O
. O

The O
whole O
process O
took O
only O
a O
week O
from O
complaint O
to O
fix O
! O

11 O
g O
wireless O
card O
, O
which O
ran O
up O
to O
54Mbps O
, O
and O
occasionally O
suffered O
from O
loss O
of O
signal O
. O

And O
as O
others O
have O
said O
there O
is O
the O
search O
button O
where O
the O
caps O
lock O
key O
is O
but O

works O
wonderfully O
and O
does O
what O
it O
suppose O
to O
do O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Full O
size O
usb O
plug O
requires O
adapter O
for O
most O
tablets O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
unit O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
some O
functionalities O
did O
not O
work O
on O
Windows O
8 O
like O
they O
do O
on O
Windows O
7.- O
Drivers O
. O

and O
they O
asked O
like O
500 O
questions O
and O
wanted O
me O
to O
take O
it O
to O
a O
repair O
shop O
to O
have O
them O
test O
whether O
their O
battery O
caused O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
little O
front O
pocket O
gives O
me O
extra O
space O
to O
throw O
in O
a O
few O
extra O
things O
. O

so O
that O
is O
why O
I O
considered O
the O
SSHD O
or O
the O
10 O
, O
000 O
rpm O
drive O
. O

Oh O
boy O
! O

( O
I O
hope O
anyone O
who O
does O
and O
has O
tested O
the O
mCube O
90 O
with O
their O
Mac O
will O
post O
a O
comment O
here.)As O
far O
as O
my O
Fire O
is O
concerned O
, O
at O
first O
I O
thought O
I O
needed O
to O
get O
a O
custom O
tip O
, O
and O
Innergie O
responded O
quickly O
to O
let O
me O
know O
that O
one O
that O
small O
was O
not O
available O
. O

With O
the O
PoGo O
, O
picture O
quality O
is O
so O
- O
so O
( O
certainly O
better O
than O
any O
of O
the O
Polaroid O
instant O
cameras O
) O
. O

A O
wide O
- O
angle O
lens O
is O
a O
must O
. O

I O
planned O
to O
re O
- O
solder O
it O
but O
decided O
to O
see O
how O
hot O
my O
laptop O
would O
get O
without O
the O
fans O
. O

And O
it O
's O
also O
pretty O
good O
- O
looking O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
! O

I O
have O
an O
old O
desktop O
running O
windows O

This O
is O
truly O
a O
sleeve O
. O

Plus O
, O
the O
fans O
did O
n't O
work O
when O
I O
shut O
the O
computer O
lid O
even O
though O
my O
settings O
are O
such O
that O
the O
computer O
does O
n't O
shut O
down O
or O
hibernate O
with O
the O
lid O
closed O
. O

Fit O
and O
finish O
is O
excellent O
for O
the O
price O
but O
not O
really O
built O
like O
a O
tank O
which O
was O
standard O
for O
the O
Thinkpads O
. O

The O
Inspirons O
we O
run O
only O
require O
one O
connection O
to O
dock O
. O

Their O
customer O
service O
is O
amazing O
. O

I O
immediatelly O
like O
the O
new O
one O
as O
it O
weighed O
about O
1/2 O
of O
what O
the O
old O
case O
weighed O
. O

Difficult O
system O
to O
get O
your O
information O
off O
of O
it O
if O
the O
device O
is O
defective O
. O

Windows O
just O
feels O
old O
. O

I O
had O
him O
set O
to O
lowest O
setting O
which O
worked O
fine O
for O
my O
applications O
. O

Overall O
, O
aside O
from O
the O
flaws O
that O
can O
mostly O
be O
worked O
around O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
both O
fun O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
attractive O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
can O
perform O
most O
tasks O
one O
might O
need O
a O
computer O
for O
with O
little O
to O
no O
problems O
. O

The O
only O
way O
I O
can O
tell O
is O
the O
small O
opening O
for O
the O
webcam O
. O

Oh O
, O
as O
many O
of O
the O
reviewers O
have O
said O
, O
getting O
this O
thing O
to O
work O
with O
a O
Mac O
is O
VERY O
difficult O
. O

You O
MUST O
run O
the O
installation O
prorgam O
from O
the O
CD O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
. O

Came O
in O
retail O
package O
. O

Good O
laptop O
for O
good O
price O
. O

ca O
n't O
believe O
it O
works O
and O
is O
still O
workingholds O
a O
long O
charge O
like O
it O
should O
, O
but O
not O
as O
well O
as O
a O
factory O
battery O

The O
keypad O
is O
indeed O
a O
little O
hard O
, O
but O
pressing O
at O
the O
edges O
may O
help O
as O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
softer O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
I O
bought O
this O
speaker O
over O
others O
was O
for O
the O
AC O
option O
at O
an O
affordable O
price O
. O

The O
problem O
got O
worse O
but O
it O
appeared O
to O
me O
that O
is O
was O
more O
a O
BIOS O
or O
resource O
conflict O
issue O
and O
after O
seeing O
other O
people O
were O
having O
the O
same O
issue O
, O
I O
had O
hoped O
HP O
would O
resolve O
this O
and O
offer O
a O
fix O
through O
an O
update O
. O

Is O
exactly O
what O
I O
expect O
a O
netbook O
to O
be O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
has O
a O
very O
proprietary O
cord O
to O
charge O
it O

people O
in O
other O
reviews O
complained O
about O
being O
able O
to O
see O
the O
adapter O
ring O
in O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
shots O

even O
if O
you O
keep O
it O
plugged O
in O
, O
it O
will O
allow O
it O
to O
slowly O
drop O
below O
95%.That O
said O
, O
I O
've O
gotten O
up O
to O
14 O
hours O
of O
battery O
life O
with O
this O
netbook O
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
be O
functioning O
, O
i. O
e. O
, O
the O
fully O
charged O
light O
came O
on O
, O
but O
when O
you O
unplugged O
the O
charger O
the O
battery O
would O
not O
support O
the O
computer O
. O

Waste O
of O
money O
! O

Great O
monitor O
for O
the O
price O
. O

I O
went O
to O
YouTube O
to O
get O
reviews O
from O
owners O
& O
reviewers O
. O

It O
is O
not O
always O
quick O
to O
pull O
the O
MBA O
out O
( O
and O
the O
snugness O
accelerates O
fading O
of O
the O
sticker O
I O
have O
on O
it O
but O
not O
a O
big O
deal).2 O
) O

and O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

a O
Pentium O
B980 O
( O
Sandy O
Bridge O
) O
at O
2 O
. O

Made O
in O
China O
products O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
brand O
, O
seem O
to O
be O
inferior O
in O
their O
quality O
control O
compared O
to O
those O
that O
use O
to O
be O
manufactured O
in O
Japan O
or O
Korea O
. O

It O
does O
not O
get O
hot O
like O
my O
other O

I O
have O
taken O
over O
1200 O
photos O
and O
40 O
minutes O
of O
video O
with O
this O
card O
. O

last O
generation O
monochrome O
Kindle O
. O
) O

You O
get O
aural O
and O
visual O
confirmation O
of O
connectivity O
and O
set O
on O
and O
off O
. O

According O
to O
NuMark O
, O
that O
is O
because O
SanDisk O
has O
changed O
something O
in O
the O
low O
level O
architecture O
in O
a O
way O
that O
renders O
them O
incompatible O
with O
some O
devices O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
are O
better O
quality O
devices O
( O
name O
brands O
) O
available O

So O
I O
play O
computer O
games O
fairly O
regularly O
and O
figured O
the O
mouse O
that O
came O
with O
my O
computer O
was O
no O
longer O
cutting O
it O
. O

I O
paid O
300 O
dollars O
for O
it O
brand O
new O
, O
on O
sale O
. O

It O
works O
great O
and O
price O
was O
great O
too O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
those O
who O
criticized O
my O
review O
for O
my O
opinion O
on O
Firewire O
and O
the O
display O
. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
when O
I O
started O
to O
put O
my O
13 O
" O
MacBook O
into O
it O
; O
takes O
a O
tiny O
bit O
of O
stretching O
, O
however O
, O
the O
MacBook O
fits O
inside O
quite O
well O
. O

But O
at O
default O
, O
this O
model O
can O
be O
quite O
warm O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
a O
while O
and O
it O
has O
outperformed O
every O
other O
computer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

This O
was O
even O
after O
restarting O
the O
laptop O
. O

At O
the O
time O
I O
noticed O
that O
some O
input O
jacks O
were O
not O
functioning O
but O
did O
n't O
complain O
until O
I O
got O
my O
wife O
a O
Wii O
and O
needed O
tmore O
jacks O
. O

Also O
, O
this O
thing O
runs O
on O
6 O
AA O
batteries O

This O
cable O
, O
lock O
, O
and O
eyehole O
attachment O
set O
is O
a O
decent O
theft O
deterrent O
for O
any O
device O
that O
has O
a O
built O
- O
in O
security O
slot O
. O

Alongwith O
Universal O
International O
Travel O
Plug O
Adapter O
for O
all O
Countries O
, O
the O
package O
is O
all O
you O
need O
for O
all O
your O
charging O
needs O
in O
US O
and O
abroad O
. O

Great O
innovation O
. O

For O
places O
that O
do O
n't O
have O
Wi O
- O
Fi O
, O
I O
can O
use O
my O
Android O
Smartphone O
with O
a O
4 O
G O
signal O
and O
full O

their O
products).This O
Laptop O
is O
lightning O
fast O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
a O
joy O
to O
type O
on O
, O
speakers O
are O
great O
, O
webcam O
view O
is O
clear O
and O
the O
very O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
Ultra O
bay O
hot O
swap O
. O

a O
while O
you O
miss O
the O
keyboard O
, O
specially O
for O
working O
. O

M O
you O
see O
on O
most O
lower O
cost O
sandy O
bridge O
i5 O
laptops3 O
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
is O
that O
I O
'd O
like O
a O
few O
more O
options O
in O
loop O
size O
, O
especially O
on O
the O
larger O
version O
. O

so O
I O
can O
access O
it O
from O
anywhere O
remotely O
, O
that O
works O
really O
well O
. O

The O
lights O
on O
it O
let O
you O
see O
how O
much O
juice O
is O
left O
which O
is O
convenient O
as O
well O
. O

You O
spray O
the O
cloth O
that O
is O
included O
with O
it O
and O
then O
apply O
it O
to O
the O
screen O
. O

At O
most O
it O
should O
only O
stick O
out O
a O
quarter O
inch O
or O
so O
. O

At O
first O
it O
seemed O
like O
a O
great O
little O
hub O
, O
but O
then O
it O
started O
failing O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
were O
more O
just O
because O
I O
am O
very O
mobile O
with O
it O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
battery O
life O

The O
sound O
was O
n't O
great O
but O
what O
do O
expect O
at O
this O
price O
. O

Over O
all O
we O
are O
very O
pleased O
with O
our O
purchase O
. O

Apple O
previously O
offered O
two O
15-inch O
models O
: O
one O
, O
for O
approximately O
two O
- O
thousand O
dollars O
, O
and O
one O
for O
approximately O
three O
- O
hundred O
more O
. O

I O
hoped O
it O
would O
correct O
my O
problem O
and O
give O
me O
a O
stronger O
signal O
. O

I O
went O
out O
of O
my O
way O
to O
find O
a O
machine O
that O
did O
nt O
have O
the O
intel O
video O
card O
( O
like O
the O
15 O
" O
version O
of O
this O
same O
notebook O
) O
because O
intel O
3-d O
cards O
are O
not O
really O
3-d O
cards O
. O

Definately O
glad O
I O
purchased O
this O
. O

Both O
the O
HP2133 O
and O
this O
ACER O
have O
92 O
% O
sized O
keyboards O
. O

Only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
audio O
input O
requires O
use O
of O
headphone O
out O
on O
computer O
, O
which O
usually O
disables O
the O
built O
in O
speakers O
= O
less O
sound O
. O

If O
you O
have O
the O
same O
needs O
as O
I O
did O
, O
buy O
this O
product O
. O

And O
it O
can O
be O
used O
this O
way O
as O
an O
alarm O
clock O
if O
you O
want O
as O
well O
. O

The O
webcam O
itself O
takes O
very O
high O
- O
quality O
pictures O
and O
video O
. O

Easy O
to O
install O
, O
and O
at O
a O
great O
price O
too O
! O

so O
i O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
how O
this O
happen O
. O

4Ghz O
channelyou O
are O
broadcasting O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
find O
drivers O
for O
it O
anywhere O
either O
... O

How O
do O
I O
find O
out O
how O
to O
get O
that O
replaced O
? O

Once O
the O
case O
is O
snapped O
on O
. O

The O
adaptor O
does O
not O
fit O
into O
the O
socket O
. O

This O
case O
ads O
almost O
no O
additional O
thickness O
to O
the O
extremely O
then O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
tab O
10 O
. O

It O
lasts O
at O
least O
5 O
hours O
between O
charges O
now O
, O
it O
has O
better O
battery O
life O
than O
it O
did O
when O
it O
was O
new O
. O

to O
get O
the O
current O
drivers O
. O

Great O
to O
do O
online O
shopping O
. O

Nor O
is O
the O
cover O
marked O
to O
show O
which O
is O
the O
front O
vs O
back O
( O
top O
vs O
bottom O
is O
easy O
to O
figure O
out).However O
; O
the O
real O
kicker O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
its O
NOT O
designed O
for O
the O
new O
2013 O
Haswell O
Macbook O
Air O
as O
the O
new O
second O
mic O
hole O
is O
completely O
covered O
by O
the O
cover O
. O

First O
off O
, O
I O
want O
to O
mention O
that O
while O
the O
G74 O
is O
kind O
of O
marketed O
as O
good O
for O
games O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
that O
scare O
you O
off O
if O
you O
're O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
, O
high O
end O
notebook O
for O
other O
uses O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
registering O
with O
Dell O
, O
I O
tried O
updating O
to O
Windows O
8 O
. O

Wanted O
one O
not O
so O
bulky O
for O
myself O

I O
'm O
sure O
there O
are O
better O
graphics O
systems O
in O
more O
expensive O
laptops O
, O
but O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
game O
that O
It O
wo O
n't O
run O
on O
Max O
settings O
. O

I O
've O
used O
this O
on O
a O
WIndows O
PC O
and O
a O
Mac O
, O
and O
it O
apparently O
works O
on O
Linux O
and O
Android O
( O
per O
other O
reviewers O
) O
. O

The O
compact O
size O
and O
light O
weight O
make O
it O
very O
portable O
. O

Those O
cloths O
are O
fabulous O
! O

Like O
listening O
to O
music O
while O
in O
the O
shower O
? O

The O
bag O
is O
quite O
heavy O
though O
and O
if O
you O
add O
a O
laptop O
to O
the O
bag O
it O
will O
become O
even O
more O
heavier O
. O

It O
's O
just O
less O
likely O
to O
die O
and O
that O
is O
very O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

I O
've O
had O
it O
for O
a O
year O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
quit O
yet O
. O

It O
also O
includes O
a O
migration O
software O
for O
use O
with O
windows O
. O

The O
Microsoft O
Neoprene O
case O
is O
well O
made O
and O
the O
only O
laptop O
sleeve O
I O
could O
find O
with O
handles O
. O

The O
power O
adapter O
itself O
is O
quite O
small O
, O
and O
I O
've O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
either O
it O
or O
the O
computer O
itself O
getting O
hot O
while O
charging O
or O
in O
use O
. O

what O
else O
do O
you O
want O
? O

Electronics O
today O
are O
all O
produced O
by O
the O
lowest O
bidder O
. O

but O
then O
you O
want O
to O
use O
the O
pen O
, O
then O
it O
's O
right O
there O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
find O
a O
better O
1440p O
monitor O
for O
this O
price O
, O
and O
it O
probably O
wo O
n't O
be O
this O
cheap O
much O
longer O
. O

i O
got O
mine O
at O
walmart O
on O
sale O
for O
278 O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
both O
Toshiba O
and O
AMD O
have O
done O
a O
very O
nice O
job O
with O
their O
products O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
the O
stock O
software O
works O
, O
but O
flashing O
it O
with O
DD O
- O
WRT O
is O
easy O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

I O
TRIED O
TO O
USE O
THIS O

It O
works O
fine O
with O
iTunes O
, O
Internet O
Radio O
, O
Internet O
TV O
, O
and O
every O
other O
form O
of O
computer O
sound O
I O
've O
tried O
. O

The O
Apple O
AirPort O
Express O
has O
several O
drawbacks O
. O

It O
is O
designed O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
desk O
. O

Excellent O
quality O
for O
such O
a O
cheap O
netbook O
. O

I O
have O
my O
brothers O
old O
laptop O
which O
has O
a O
non O
functioning O
( O
dead O
) O

Decent O
bass O
even O
on O
low O
volume O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
I O
have O
with O
this O
machine O
is O
its O
screen O
being O
too O
bright O
. O

but O
I O
've O
since O
coped O
with O
free O
third O
party O
applications O
. O

/tabsCtrl O

Tab O

( O
Actually O
, O
I O
find O
a O
better O
way O
recently O
where O
you O
can O
use O
three O
fingers O
and O
swipe O
the O
mousepad O
left O
or O
right O
to O
actually O
select O
between O
different O

but O
eventually O
the O
cable O
softens O
over O
time O
and O
bends O
backwards O

Pretty O
simple O
.... O
does O
what O
it O
s O
supposed O
to O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
bought O
this O
! O

It O
's O
manufacturer O
is O
listed O
as O
ML O

In O
this O
way O
any O

using O
any O

can O
take O

of O
the O

The O

and O

. O

That O
fits O
with O
NO O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

remove O
my O
Blu O
- O
ray O
drive O
from O
my O
work O
computer O
, O
put O
it O
into O
this O
enclosure O
and O
now O
I O
have O
a O
Blu O
- O
ray O
drive O
for O
my O
home O
computer O
. O

She O
has O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
ve O
bought O
at O
least O
4 O
- O
5 O
HDMI O
to O
Thunderbolt O
cables O
off O
of O
Amazon O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
and O
its O
always O
the O
same O
. O

It O
really O
looks O
like O
a O
heavy O
duty O
industrial O
use O
cable O
( O
unsightly O
, O
heavy O
and O
hard O
to O
hide O
) O
but O
it O
works O
just O
fine O
. O

So O
go O
buy O
it O
, O

Lacking O
any O
guidance O
, O
I O
just O
plugged O
it O
in O
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
I O
needed O
to O
do O
; O
it O
installed O
its O
software O
with O
no O
intervention O
required O
. O

Starting O
testing O
the O
unit O
. O

There O
are O
properly O
aligned O
holes O
for O
the O
camera O
and O
microphone O
. O

It O
is O
wonderfully O
light O
. O

Then O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
DVI O
to O
HDMI O
adapter O
and O
decided O
to O
look O
for O
HDMI O
KVM O
switches O
instead O
, O
and O
found O
this O
one O
. O

Please O
add O
a O
DC O
power O
input O
to O
make O
it O
the O
best O
product O

However O
, O
after O
using O
the O
product O
decided O
to O
update O
it O
and O
give O
it O
one O
more O
star O
. O

I O
do O
notice O
that O
occasionally O
lint O
builds O
up O
in O
the O
bottom O

Like O
great O
icing O
on O
great O
cake O
. O

No O
hassle O
or O
driver O
issues O
. O

but O
when O
it O
did O
blow O
My O
Macbook O
shut O
off O
instantly O
. O

My O
computer O
is O
new O
and O
I O
really O
hope O
the O
legendary O
Asus O
quality O
( O
well O
known O
in O
making O
some O
of O
the O
best O
quality O
motherboards O
on O
the O
market O
) O
comes O
through O
with O
the O
reliability O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
any O
noise O
or O
humming O
sounds O
and O
it O
's O
far O
lighter O
than O
my O
original O
. O

Very O
smooth O
, O
open O
, O
and O
acoustic O
. O

So O
, O
for O
all O
the O
reasons O
above O
, O
I O
picked O
this O
laptop O
. O

Oddly O
enough O
, O
unplugging O
it O
and O
plugging O
it O
back O
in O
will O
bring O
it O
back O
to O
being O
centered O
, O
but O
who O
wants O
to O
unplug O
their O
monitor O
every O
single O
time O
they O
boot O
their O
workstation O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
easiest O
way O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
your O
new O
router O
is O
to O
look O
through O
all O
the O
headings O
and O
click O
through O
the O
tabs O
. O

Mine O
is O
full O
of O
streaks O
after O
washing O
it O
, O
and O
if O
this O
works O
better O
than O
Windex O
( O
which O
is O
what O
I O
used O
) O
, O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
. O

But O
, O
considering O
the O
price O
, O
the O
build O
quality O
is O
satisfactory O
. O

Too O
often O
the O
sacrifices O
manufacturers O
make O

I O
got O
the O
instructions O
from O
another O
reviewer O
, O
Joe6pack O
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
buttered O
popcorn O
while O
you O
're O
using O
it O
. O

It O
works O
great O
! O

I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
amplification O
of O
my O
laptop O
audio O
with O
these O
speakers O
. O

I O
'm O
an O
adult O
with O
fairly O
small O
hands O
and O
it O
seems O
comfortable O
for O
me O
to O
use O
also O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
if O
that O
is O
where O
you O
use O
your O
machine O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
here O
are O
a O
few O
things O
you O
might O
want O
to O
know.- O
The O
claim O
that O
this O
works O
for O
a O
17 O
inch O
machine O
is O
a O
little O
. O
. O
. O

I O
use O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
from O
work O
, O
and O
needed O
this O
for O
use O
at O
home O
, O
as O
I O
work O
most O
often O
from O
home O
. O

It O
's O
like O
a O
wormhole O
beware O
. O

However O
, O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
this O
simple O
issue O
got O
past O
Microsoft O
.. O

I O
wanted O
a O
small O
case O
that O
would O
1 O
) O
protect O
it O
2 O
) O
hold O
the O
cord O
and O
3 O
) O
stay O
compact O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
not O
made O
for O
those O
purposes O
. O

Battery O
charges O
devices O
very O
slowly O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
does O
what O
it O
was O
designed O
to O
do O
. O

We O
tried O
our O
car O
chargers O
, O
iHome O
stereos O
, O
etc O
but O
nothing O
would O
charge O
it O
except O
a O
PC O
with O
USB O
cable O
. O

Still O
, O
this O
was O
really O
intended O
for O
use O
with O
windows O
laptops O
( O
must O
support O
plug O
- O
n O
- O
play O
drivers O
) O
. O

Great O
for O
gaming O
, O
I O
use O
it O
better O
than O
my O
keyboard O
, O
great O
for O
wrist O
support O
which O
is O
main O
reason O
why O
i O
got O
it O
because O
keyboard O
angle O
was O
hurting O
me O
. O

glowing O
reviews O
. O

When O
I O
put O
items O
in O
the O
pockets O
( O
VGA O
adapter O
, O
ac O
adapter O
extension O
cord O
, O
usb O
drive O
, O
plug O
adapters O
for O
ac O
adapter O
; O
all O
fit O
at O
the O
same O
time O
) O
the O
case O
looks O
kinda O
silly O
and O
haters O
will O
hate O
, O
but O
it O
's O
functional O
so O
they O
can O
shove O
it O
. O

I O
suppose O
you O
could O
use O
it O
for O
that O
, O
but O
having O
used O
real O
deticated O
bike O
bags O
I O
'd O
stick O
with O
using O
this O
for O
the O
laptop O
. O

A O
rubberized O
base O
on O
the O
speaker O
helps O
to O
keep O
it O
in O
place O
on O
whatever O
surface O
you O
place O
it O
, O
a O
nice O
feature O
that O
also O
prevents O
scratching O
of O
your O
furniture O
. O

I O
have O
a O
GSII O
and O
a O
nexus O
7 O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
use O
to O
Cloud O
computing O
you O
need O
to O
take O
the O
time O
to O
learn O
! O

This O
part O
was O
really O
confusing O
the O
first O
couple O
times O
I O
tried O
it O

Speck O
does O
not O
make O
cases O
for O
this O
model O
! O

I O
even O
have O
the O
tiny O
USB O
connector O
sticking O
out O
and O
the O
zipper O
passes O
over O
top O
of O
that O
. O

the O
cooler O
itself O
so O
very O
very O
quiet O

Do O
n't O
recommend O
if O
you O
intend O
to O
use O
it O
very O
much O
. O

edit O
: O
I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
for O
about O
five O
weeks O
and O
it O
appears O
the O
hard O
drive O
suddenly O
died O
. O

I O
have O
purchased O
about O
7 O
or O
8 O
notebooks O
in O
the O
last O
5 O
years O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
something O
bricked O
in O
less O
than O
2 O
months O
of O
use O
. O

It O
feels O
great O
, O
just O
like O
leather O
on O
the O
outside O
with O
a O
soft O
material O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

I O
've O
notice O
while O
it O
is O
tablet O
mode O
, O
the O
processing O
power O
is O
restricted O
to O
only O
800mhz O
. O

No O
idea O
about O
Windoze O
or O
Apple O
, O
but O

The O
premise O
of O
Sonos O
is O
that O
you O
own O
a O
digital O
music O
collection O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
road O
warrior O
and O
do O
n't O
need O
a O
powerful O
laptop O
for O
work O
. O

Limited O
Pre O

and O

MS O
PowerPoint O
ReaderOverall O

The O
Toshiba O
video O
player O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

It O
works O
great O
. O

I O
attribute O
this O
to O
the O
SS O
cache O
drive O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

The O
cost O
can O
be O
only O
determined O
after O
a O
physical O
examination O
of O
the O
product O
by O
a O
service O
technician O
to O
isolate O
the O
issue O
. O

For O
$ O
25 O
, O
I O
would O
give O
it O
Five O
Stars O
, O
but O
at O
this O
price O
I O
can O
only O
give O
it O
three O
. O

You O
get O
the O
unit O
, O
a O
charger O
, O
a O
battery O
, O
a O
wrist O
strap O
( O
that O
also O
works O
as O
a O
handle O
, O
very O
clever O
) O
and O
a O
cheap O
( O
poor O
quality O
) O
case O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
, O
these O
adapters O
worked O
perfectly O
. O

I O
then O
listened O
to O
some O
rock O
music O
which O
it O
also O
handled O
very O
well O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
a O
standard O
resolution O
1366 O
x O
768 O
with O
10 O
point O
touchscreen O
, O
The O
processor O
an O
Haswell O
i7 O
Ultra O
Low O
Voltage O
processor O
, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
achieve O
those O
battery O
times O
. O

You O
also O
have O
to O
be O
extra O
careful O
when O
using O
the O
keys O
as O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
inadvertently O
touch O
the O
touchpad O
and O
send O
your O
typing O
an O
earlier O
part O
of O
your O
letter O
or O
project O
. O

The O
Everki O
backpack O
has O
more O
pockets O
and O
compartments O
and O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
so O
far O
! O

The O
laptops O
that O
meet O
these O
requirements O
are O
quite O
pricey O
right O
now O
, O
so O
I O
will O
stick O
with O
this O
" O
enhanced O
" O
netbook O
. O

My O
mom O
has O
back O
problems O
and O
her O
monitor O
was O
set O
too O
far O
back O
on O
the O
counter O
in O
the O
office O
so O
, O
it O
made O
her O
lean O
. O

When O
the O
computer O
gets O
a O
bit O
dirty O
, O
I O
wipe O
it O
with O
soapy O
water O
or O
Windex O
, O
and O
it O
is O
shining O
like O
new O
instantly O
. O

Plus O
the O
keys O
are O
much O
easier O
to O
read O
and O
have O
a O
better O
feel O
for O
typing O
. O

The O
battery O
fit O
perfectly O
into O
the O
battery O
compartment O
and O
is O
holding O
a O
charge O
. O

But O
an O
honest O
jump O
. O

It O
was O
much O
cheaper O
than O
the O
alternatives O
for O
my O
older O
laptop O
and O
is O
flush O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
laptop O
. O

First O
the O
obvious O
question O
, O
why O
choose O
this O
over O
a O
cheaper O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
dock O
? O

priced O
for O
what O
you O
getCons O

I O
do O
love O
the O
length O
of O
this O
cable O
though O
, O
it O
is O
perfect O
for O
charging O
my O
tablet O
and O
phone O
at O
my O
couch O
. O

The O
tip O
of O
this O
adapter O
and O
the O
original O
charger O
tip O
are O
the O
same O
size O
, O
so O
this O
adapter O
is O
not O
causing O
any O
issues O
. O

and O
now O
I O
can O
run O
4 O
USB O
drives O
from O
the O
one O
remaining O
working O
port O
on O
this O
laptop O
. O

The O
plug O
is O
also O
effective O
with O
my O
attachabel O
keyboard O
. O

Blue O
light O
on O
top O
could O
be O
annoying O
for O
some O

Had O
a O
problem O
with O
distortion O
on O
the O
mic O
when O
the O
dongle O
was O
plugged O
in O
to O
a O
USB O
hub O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
taking O
mine O
off O
and O
keep O
my O
screen O
naked O
until O
I O
find O
a O
similar O
screen O
to O
the O
Spigen O
film O
. O

It O
has O
to O
be O
installed O
AFTER O
the O
flash O
10 O
. O
2 O
installation O
in O
order O
to O
work O
. O

Since O
almost O
everyone O
in O
my O
family O
wears O
glasses O
, O
I O
purchased O
this O
pack O
to O
give O
a O
cloth O
to O
every O
member O
of O
my O
family O
who O
wear O
glasses O
. O

So O
many O
business O
travelers O
carry O
these O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
get O
them O
in O
the O
bag O
if O
you O
are O
carrying O
documents O
as O
well.*No O
water O
bottle O
holder O
. O

Came O
3 O
in O
a O
pack O
. O

The O
USB O
plug O
that O
powers O
the O
device O
is O
nice O
because O
it O
allows O
for O
something O
to O
be O
plugged O
in O
on O
top O
of O
it O
. O

Using O
the O
adapter O
after O
the O
drivers O
are O
installed O
is O
fairly O
straight O
forward O
, O
just O
plug O
in O
the O
adapter O
to O
a O
free O
USB O
port O

I O
mean O
when O
you O
try O
to O
bend O
the O
wire O
, O
it O
will O
rebound O
after O
some O
minutes O
. O

Two O
days O
ago O
it O
died O
. O

I O
returned O
it O
for O
a O
replacement O
. O

This O
is O
the O
mean O
reason O
I O
chose O
this O
product O
when O
I O
got O
my O
new O
laptop O
. O

I O
uploaded O
a O
picture O
to O
the O
product O
page O
, O
you O
can O
check O
it O
out O
to O
see O
the O
size O
... O
it O
really O
is O
as O
small O
as O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
default O
picture O
. O

The O
quality O
was O
n't O
clear O
as O
a O
720p O
camera O
could O
produce O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
exceptional O
. O

I O
say O
almost O
, O
because O
if O
you O
look O
close O
, O
it O
's O
like O
it O
's O
compressed O
somehow O
, O
but O
it O
's O
very O
clever O
and O
from O
the O
couch O
you O
can O
barely O
tell O
. O

I O
also O
did O
not O
like O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
case O
. O

Kudos O
to O
the O
seller O
! O

With O
the O
original O
HDD O
it O
took O
over O
a O
minute O
to O
reach O
login O
, O
with O
the O
samsung O
I O
'm O
prompted O
for O
a O
password O
within O
10sec O
of O
pushing O
the O
power O
button O
. O

Lasted O
longer O
than O
the O
computer O
. O

so O
I O
decided O
I O
wanted O
to O
take O
a O
step O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
tablet O
. O

So O
far O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
with O
this O
one O
as O
it O
is O
much O
larger O
and O
easier O
to O
view O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
highly O
unusual O
for O
a O
power O
supply O
and O
I O
have O
purchased O
many O
for O
different O
devices O
and O
purposes O
over O
the O
years O
. O

My O
reasons O
are O
that O
I O
m O
hard O
on O
my O
computers O
, O
they O
go O
everywhere O
with O
me O
. O

so O
I O
will O
assume O
the O
inverter O
could O
not O
handle O
the O
load O
from O
the O
laptop O
power O
supply O
. O

I O
opened O
up O
my O
FinalWire O
AIDA64 O
Extreme O
and O
it O
told O
me O
that O
the O
modules O
are O
really O

This O
paired O
immediately O
and O
easily O
with O
my O
Samsung O
Galaxy O
Note O
10 O
. O

I O
will O
put O
a O
nice O
laptop O
skin O
on O
it O
to O
cover O
both O
- O
but O
an O
$ O
1100 O
+ O
system O
should O
not O
have O
damage O
like O
this O
. O

My O
son O
is O
enjoying O
this O
and O
its O
ease O
of O
connection O

I O
thought O
this O
AE1000 O
would O
compliment O
my O
E3000 O
router O
nicely O
, O
but O
instead O
it O
has O
quite O
terrible O
antenna O
strength O
. O

It O
powers O
and O
charges O
and O
charges O
the O
laptop O
fine O
but O
the O
cord O
seems O
a O
bit O
flimsy O
an O
thinner O
than O
stock O
so O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
. O

I O
lose O
my O
Macbook O
adapters O
like O
crazy O
and O
I O
hate O
having O
to O
pay O
out O
the O
nose O
for O
these O
. O

I O
have O
not O
bothered O
to O
try O
it O
, O
but O
I O
've O
read O
that O
the O
software O
from O
Canon O
is O
n't O
any O
good O
. O

It O
may O
not O
have O
every O
single O
bell O
and O
whistle O
. O

Update O
: O
Three O
power O
cords O
, O
all O
genuine O
Apple O
products O
, O
have O
failed O
now O
. O

Item O
did O
not O
meet O
expectations O
. O

you O
may O
need O
to O
slow O
down O
the O
mouse O
in O
the O
controlpanel O
a O
bit O
. O

Remember O
the O
Apple O
TV O
commercial O
where O
the O
PC O
guy O
is O
saying O
" O
Its O
fixed O
this O
time O
, O
trust O
me O
" O
, O
once O
for O
each O
new O
Windows O
release O
? O

The O
downside O
: O
The O
apps O
and O
iPhone O
connectivity O
are O
inconsistent O
at O
best O
. O

I O
would O
suggest O
using O
the O
included O
CD O
to O
install O
the O
driver O
. O

Mine O
uses O
a O
AA O
battery O
. O

This O
keyboard O
/ O
case O
is O
of O
sturdy O
construction O
. O

The O
protection O
is O
unparalleled O
. O

A O
few O
reviewers O
here O
said O
their O
package O
came O
with O
a O
return O
label O
to O
recycle O
their O
old O
battery O
, O
but O
mine O
did O
n't O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
these O
speakers O
have O
been O
a O
great O
deal O
since O
day O
one O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
battery O
for O
several O
weeks O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

Do O
n't O
have O
a O
bunch O
to O
say O
about O
it O
. O

This O
this O
rocks O
especially O
with O
netbooks O
! O

I O
was O
able O
to O
connect O
this O
baby O
on O
my O
big O
screen O
TV O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
watch O
streaming O
movies O
for O
free O
on O
my O
big O
screen!. O

It O
self O
installs O
from O
there O
. O

and O
I O
really O
like O
Aperture O
2 O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
new O
charger O
to O
pair O
with O
the O
new O
battery O
. O

After O
installing O
Office O
2011 O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
simply O
trying O
to O
surf O
the O
web O
would O
result O
in O
delays O
and O
the O
" O
spinning O
rainbow O
ball O
of O
death O
" O
delaying O
page O
loadings O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
I O
hesitate O
between O
a O
one O
star O
( O
I O
hate O
it O
) O
and O
a O
two O
stars O
( O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
) O
rating O
because O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
interference O
with O
just O
about O
everything O
you O
do O
with O
the O
bag O
is O
THAT O
annoying O
. O

SandDisk O
Ultras O
are O
not O
on O
that O
list O
at O
all O
. O

Charges O
well O
, O
pretty O
decent O
length O
cord O
, O
and O
definitely O
a O
lot O
better O
quality O
than O
the O
original O
cord O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

This O
battery O
continues O
to O
perform O
well O
after O
all O
this O
time O
and O
repeated O
charges O
. O

The O
bendable O
neck O
is O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
support O
the O
light O
itself O
so O
anytime O
I O
've O
plugged O
it O
in O
the O
light O
will O
just O
fall O
over O
. O

I O
have O
a O
dell O
axim O
x51v O
and O
loaded O
it O
with O
slingmobile O

1 O
year O
of O
great O
service O
so O
far O
. O

I O
have O
only O
edited O
one O
small O
clip O
using O
Sony O
Vegas O
Movie O
Studio O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
feature O
and O
" O
shuts O
off O
" O
the O
mouse O
when O
it O
is O
stowed O
. O

After O
consulting O
with O
an O
online O
guide O
for O
replacing O
keys O
( O
and O
after O
3 O
hours O
of O
sweating O
over O
the O
tiny O
pieces O
) O
I O
got O
one O
key O
back O
on O
completely O
and O
the O
other O
back O
on O
most O
of O
the O
way O
. O

Note O
that O
this O
is O
a O
15 O
" O
laptop O
( O
I O
personally O
prefer O
smaller O
14 O
" O
laptops O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
purchased O
it O
likes O
the O
bigger O
ones O
) O
... O

Plugged O
it O
in O
and O
everything O
was O
good O
. O

but O
I O
felt O
it O
made O
the O
point O
that O
it O
was O
not O
the O
content O
at O
fault O
. O

I O
wish O
that O
the O
LG O
BD390 O
operated O
at O
5Ghz O
range O
, O
but O
that O
's O
another O
story O
. O

It O
worked O
for O
both O
, O
but O
I O
might O
have O
replaced O
the O
Asus O
charger O
with O
a O
stock O
charger O
instead O
if O
it O
was O
a O
laptop O
for O
daily O
use O
. O

works O
great O
, O
if O
it O
annoys O
you O
. O

good O
for O
word O
processing O
and O
web O
surfing O
. O

I O
would O
not O
waste O
your O
money O
on O
this O
product O
. O

For O
my O
future O
wireless O
plans O
, O
this O
was O
a O
good O
purchase O
, O
and O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

It O
did O
quit O
within O
the O
year O
warranty O
; O
the O
seller O
stood O
by O
the O
year O
warranty O
. O

I O
started O
with O
the O
wireless O
Mac O
mouse O
, O
which O
would O
take O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
be O
recognized O
by O
my O
iMac O
. O

I O
wanted O
them O
primarily O
to O
listen O
to O
my O
iTunes O
, O
view O
videos O
on O
YouTube O
, O
watch O
movies O
etc O
. O

After O
all O
that O
time O
, O
and O
near O
daily O
use O
, O
it O
's O
still O
in O
great O
shape O
except O
for O
one O
of O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
latches O
that O
occasionally O
slips O
open O
. O

If O
you O
're O
a O
student O
or O
a O
light O
traveler O
( O
I O
'm O
neither O
) O

Back O
in O
December O
I O
purchased O
this O
rooCase O
as O
pictured O
in O
the O
description O
for O
my O
ASUS O
TF101 O
. O

Also O
you O
can O
not O
beat O
the O
price O
on O
this O
battery O
! O
! O

I O
emailed O
LaptopMate O
, O
and O
would O
you O
believe O
not O
a O
few O
hours O
later O
an O
actual O
human O
replied O
and O
let O
me O
know O
they O
would O
be O
sending O
me O
a O
replacement O
? O

For O
something O
that O
looks O
like O
a O
toy O
, O
the O
sound O
is O
good O
. O

I O
downloaded O
the O
appropriate O
driver O
from O
the O
website[ O
... O
]and O

Consumer O
Reports O
rates O
these O
two O
brands O
as O
having O
the O
best O
performance O
and O
very O
good O
reliability O
-- O
same O
as O
Toshiba O
, O
second O
only O
, O
by O
a O
small O
margin O
, O
to O
Panasonic O
. O

the O
scales O
up O

from O

and O
text O
big O
and O
friendly O
.. O
subscription O
applies O
... O
with O

and O

this O
would O
be O
the O
best O
. O

( O
privately):if O
you O
have O
already O
download O
then O
connect O
that O
computer O
to O
the O
port O
# O

on O
the O
router O
, O
then O
reset O
the O
router O
for O
60 O
minutes O
using O
a O
paperclip O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
great O
. O

Intel O
HD O
4400 O

Also O
, O
the O
port O
for O
charging O
seems O
to O
be O
dented O
a O
little O
as O
well O
. O

Always O
reliable O
. O

The O
problem O
was O
simple O
: O

Advanced O
Tab O
. O

but O
this O
is O
the O
real O
deal O
and O
it O
works O
great O
. O

I O
use O
this O
with O
my O
Cisco O
7975 O
IP O
phone O
and O
it O
works O
very O
well O
. O

Beautiful O
looking O
! O

There O
is O
a O
small O
pocket O
that O
the O
charger O
could O
go O
in O
if O
needed O
. O

It O
is O
also O
not O
strong O
enoguh O
to O
charge O
my O
cell O
phone O
through O
the O
USB O
/ O
phone O
cord O
. O

Plus O
my O
new O
cabinets O
are O
not O
as O
big O
. O

, O
i O
wish O
they O
were O
more O
padded O
as O
the O
more O
weight O
i O
added O
the O
more O
the O
straps O
press O
into O
me O
. O

Previously O
I O
was O
always O
having O
to O
make O
house O
calls O
to O
fix O
his O
Windows O
laptop O
since O
there O
were O
so O
many O
random O
ways O
that O
he O
could O
change O
the O
settings O
, O
drag O
and O
drop O
things O
to O
the O
wrong O
place O
, O
have O
issues O
with O
the O
internet O
, O
etc O
. O

This O
USB O
adapter O
works O
great O
to O
plug O
my O
sd O
card O
reader O
into O
my O
nexus O
7 O
. O
means O
the O
laptop O
can O
stay O
home O
on O
the O
next O
vacation O
. O

She O
wanted O
a O
surge O
protector O
which O
did O
n't O
take O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
space O

I O
just O
got O
back O
from O
a O
series O
of O
hikes O
to O
Mt O
Rainier O
, O
Mt O
Baker O
etc O
... O
-- O
> O

Whether O
it O
affects O
the O
unit O
's O
long O
term O
reliability O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

but O
I O
always O
worried O
about O
its O
safety O
with O
my O
computer O
and O
did O
n't O
fit O
my O
iPad O
well O
at O
all O
. O

color1366x768 O
High O

definition O
display O
( O
I O
believe O
it O
's O
LED O
- O
backlit O
) O

I O
have O
played O
several O
Blu O
- O
Ray O
movies O
and O
it O
does O
a O
super O
job O
at O
that O
. O

Works O
great O
with O
things O
like O
Google O
voice O
calls O
and O
video O
conferencing O
. O

This O
USB O
wireless O
adapter O
seems O
to O
work O
with O
my O
Panasonic O
plasma O
TV O
, O
where O
a O
previously O
tested O
USB O
adapter O
did O
not O
. O

Not O
worth O
the O
risk O
for O
the O
few O
bucks O
saved O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
for O
4 O
stars O
is O
because O
I O
keep O
getting O
the O
X O
on O
my O
battery O
logo O
on O
the O
menu O
bar O
up O
top O
. O

so O
I O
was O
able O
to O
turn O
this O
speaker O
into O
an O
Airplay O
speaker O
by O
plugging O
it O
into O
the O
headphone O
jack O
on O
the O
Express O
. O

It O
's O
also O
easy O
to O
flip O
it O
open O
and O
start O
typing O
immediately O
. O

however O
I O
needed O
a O
little O
more O
boom O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
star O
system O
does O
n't O
allow O
me O
to O
give O
the O
charger O
5 O
stars O
for O
what O
it O
does O
and O
0 O
stars O
for O
the O
false O
advertising O
. O

even O
though O
it O
was O
priced O
well O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
mean O
it O
should O
break O
in O
a O
couple O
months O
. O

This O
is O
not O
possible O
in O
the O
Video O
in O
the O
iPad O
Air.&#9658 O
; O
Comes O
with O
Windows O
Office O
. O

The O
stand O
itself O
is O
made O
of O
sturdy O
aluminum O
( O
does O
not O
wobble O
or O
feel O
cheap O
, O
but O
is O
still O
very O
lightweight O
) O
with O
rubber O
strands O
that O
act O
as O
grips O
for O
the O
notebook O
. O

I O
've O
never O
seen O
a O
laptop O
cooler O
that O
is O
both O
so O
aesthetically O
pleasing O
and O
so O
effective O
. O

SO O
I O
knew O
I O
wanted O
one O
with O
Windows O
7 O
on O
it O
. O

I O
am O
excited.------------PS O
: O
I O
have O
now O
used O
it O
simultaneously O
MS O
Powerpoint O
, O
webex O
, O
a O
projector O
and O
a O
company O
application O
. O

The O
satellite O
speakers O
can O
handle O
very O
high O
volumes O
before O
they O
start O
buzzing O
. O

Problem O
solved O
! O

Love O
the O
Ultrabook O
form O
factor O
, O
keyboard O
is O
nice O
, O
screen O
is O
decent O
, O

any O
time O
later O
on).I O
was O
paranoid O
this O
computer O
would O
be O
unusable O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
link O
and O
recommend O
some O
products O
I O
've O
found O
essential O
when O
trying O
to O
shoot O
quality O
movies O
. O

I O
had O
problems O
with O
my O
ESATA O
enclosure O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
fix O
. O

I O
will O
be O
purchasing O
another O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
swap O
it O
between O
my O
two O
systems O
. O

For O
those O
that O
are O
worried O
about O
replacing O
an O
OEM O
battery O
with O
an O
aftermarket O
really O
should O
n't O
be O
. O

3 O
" O
MacBook O
Pro O
in O
was O
way O
less O
annoying O
, O
but O
that O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
extra O
size O
of O
the O
case O
somewhat O
. O

I O
'm O
off O
returning O
this O
item O
and O
hoping O
for O
something O
of O
the O
same O
price O
to O
do O
n't O
have O
these O
kinds O
of O
design O
flaws O
. O

I O
use O
this O
with O
an O
old O
powermac O
G4 O
and O
a O
new O
powerbook O
. O

The O
photos O
of O
the O
product O
online O
do O
n't O
tell O
the O
story O
. O

using O
it O
with O
my O
ipad O
air O
. O

So O
many O
of O
the O
apps O
that O
I O
have O
on O
both O
my O
iOS O
and O
Android O

that O
the O

they O
are O
quite O
correct O

I O
had O
the O

However O
, O
there O
is O
a O

in O

you O

I O
could O

this O

It O

not O

the O

it O
very O

my O
be O
a O

tight O

this O

so O
you O
only O
need O
to O
pull O
it O
a O

the O

is O

As O

no O

I O
really O
like O
the O
white O

and O
keyboard O
is O

too O
crappy O

I O
actually O
think O
a O
built O
- O
in O

no O

is O
the O
' O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
' O

The O
thing O
about O

you O
can O
not O
in O
anyway O
shield O
the O
cap O
with O
the O
antennas O

not O
expect O
a O

that O

Pros:- O
Looks O
awesome O
, O
high O
quality O

All O
- O
in O
- O
all O
a O
good O
purchase O
. O

It O
met O
my O
expectation O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
good O
. O

The O
description O
shows O
this O
as O
a O
5200mAh O
, O
but O
it O
's O
4400mAh O
, O
the O
same O
as O
the O
stock O
battery O
. O

Seriously O
, O
with O
lite O
usage O
and O
careful O
handling O
( O
as O
with O
all O
of O
my O
electronics O
) O
it O
stopped O
functioning O
at O
just O
over O
a O
year O
! O

It O
gets O
a O
little O
warm O
, O
but O
never O
hot O
. O

M O
really O
hit O
a O
home O
- O
run O
with O
this O
Gold O
version O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

OK O
, O
let O
's O
say O
the O
grab O
handle O
is O
n't O
a O
dealbreaker O
for O
you O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
that O
was O
large O
enough O
to O
fit O
all O
my O
accessories O
. O

In O
the O
picture O
this O
thing O
is O
a O
manly O
blood O
red O
. O

Just O
the O
right O
length O
and O
flexibility O
. O

It O
is O
also O
very O
portable O
, O
and O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
put O
SSD O
cards O
into O
an O
external O
3 O
. O
0 O
dock O
instead O
of O
inside O
my O
computer O
. O

& O
it O
's O
super O
solid O
. O

SO O
far O
it O
seems O
very O
durable O
. O

There O
could O
be O
unwanted O
applications O
running O
on O
your O
laptop O
that O
are O
utilizing O
the O
CPU O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
- O
to O
find O
out O
right O
click O
on O
the O
task O
bar O
and O
open O
the O
Task O
Manager O
, O
click O
on O
the O
CPU O
% O
column O
and O
find O
out O
if O
any O
process O
is O
consistently O
consuming O
more O
than O
3 O
- O
4 O
% O
of O
CPU O
- O
if O
yes O
, O
you O
may O
need O
to O
uninstall O
that O
app O
/ O
virus O
or O
whatever O
is O
causing O
it O
. O

The O
intous O
can O
be O
held O
in O
your O
lap O
as O
you O
recline O
back O
, O
while O
your O
head O
is O
up O
looking O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

If O
connected O
hard O
- O
drives O
are O
full O
- O
size O
, O
they O
need O
their O
own O
power O
supply O
. O

Important O
to O
note O
, O
this O
one O
does O
n't O
have O
DVI O
input O
and O
max O
res O

I O
find O
that O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
be O
minimalistic O
when O
hiking O
. O

Hopefully O
, O
you O
find O
this O
review O
helpful O
. O

The O
color O
is O
so O
rich O
( O
a O
bit O
darker O
than O
the O
picture O
though O
, O
but O
it O
hardly O
matters O
) O
and O
feels O
great O
to O
the O
touch O
; O
smooth O
matte O
feeling O
. O

It O
provides O
plenty O
for O
most O
people O

The O
slots O
accept O
two O
or O
three O
- O
prong O
plugs O
, O
and O
unlike O
some O
individual O
adapters O
I O
've O
had O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
slots O
stayed O
snug O
. O

And O
the O
detachment O
is O
so O
big O
it O
takes O
up O
the O
space O
of O
my O
only O
other O
usb O
port O
. O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
it O
. O

The O
Belkin O
is O
self O
powered O
and O
has O
a O
convenient O
long O
corded O
remote O
that O
sits O
on O
the O
table O
top O
. O

Most O
tablets O
with O
those O
functions O
were O
n't O
anywhere O
near O
my O
price O
point O
, O
and O
then O
you O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
keyboard O
dock O
on O
top O
of O
that O
. O

So O
this O
is O
overkill O
for O
me O
as O
a O
Home O
Theatre O
product O
. O

COM O
, O
look O
for O
coupons O
on O
the O
internet O
and O
you O
will O
probably O
get O
up O
to O
40 O
% O
off O
. O

I O
think O
the O
Sharkk O
has O
a O
much O
better O
design O
and O
overall O
look O
, O
but O
the O
real O
difference O
is O
the O
sound O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
get O
it O
all O
functional O
on O
his O
own O
, O
a O
plus O
, O
and O
actually O
uses O
it O
. O

, O
more O
like O
it O
has O
1 O
. O
5 O
" O
of O
slack O
on O
one O
end O
when O
its O
put O
inside O
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
replacement O
or O
spare O
battery O
. O

I O
had O
the O
original O
Chromebook O
that O
Google O
sent O
some O
people O
for O
free O
under O
the O
guise O
of O
mystery O
to O
see O
what O
it O
was O
and O
how O
it O
works O
. O

Rocks O
your O
tunes O
like O
nobodys O
business O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
use O
it O
to O
read O
the O
included O
software O
CD O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
when O
I O
see O
people O
complaining O
about O
how O
slow O
their O
computer O
is O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
realize O
that O
their O
daily O
use O
requires O
a O
faster O
processor O
and O
more O
memory O
. O

Not O
sure O
why O
you O
would O
want O
it O
to O
stand O
up O
anyway O
. O

I O
have O
a O
couple O
of O
minor O
comments O
on O
the O
down O
side O
that O
kept O
me O
from O
giving O
this O
five O
stars O
-- O
1 O
. O

Even O
my O
Magic O
Jack O
worked O
with O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
not O
trying O
to O
force O
a O
standard O
screw O
into O
the O
shallow O
VESA O
mount O
like O
a O
hyped O
- O
up O
gorilla O
will O
also O
save O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
grief O
. O

I O
feel O
this O
is O
important O
for O
you O
to O
know O
, O
since O
what O
I O
use O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
shows O
what O
I O
'm O
comfortable O
and O
familiar O
with O
. O

but O
I O
rarely O
use O
it O
. O

and O
of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
not O
backlit O
. O

It O
works O
well O
in O
most O
cases O
and O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
really O
amazing O
. O

After O
reading O
the O
reviews O
of O
this O
machine O
, O
I O
decided O
I O
would O
try O
it O
. O

Finally O
, O
there O
is O
an O
on O
/ O
off O
button O
on O
the O
underside O
of O
the O
mouse O
which O
you O
should O
use O
to O
save O
battery O
power O
when O
you O
are O
away O
from O
your O
computer O
. O

WASTE O
OF O
MONEY O
. O

This O
was O
an O
oversight O
on O
their O
part O
to O
make O
this O
a O
great O
business O
bag O
too O
. O

With O
adjustments O
it O
sounds O
good O
, O
but O
it O
really O
lacks O
good O
clarity O
and O
sounds O
a O
bit O
muffled O
with O
high O
end O
bass O
type O
songs O
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
, O
for O
$ O
329 O
this O
is O
an O
unbelievable O
value O
. O

Happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
. O

The O
Case O
Logic O
DSLR O
Photo O
Backpack O
is O
well O
made O
and O
has O
a O
well O
thought O
out O
design O
for O
your O
camera O
equipment O
and O
15 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

I O
think O
it O
will O
do O
what O
we O
expected O
it O
to O
do O
. O

My O
laptop O
weighs O
a O
few O
pounds O
, O
so O
this O
is O
my O
travel O
companion O
to O
do O
work O
while O
on O
the O
road O
. O

For O
under O
$ O
20 O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
these O
speakers O
. O

Once O
I O
got O
that O
far O
, O
they O
put O
me O
on O
hold O
. O

and O
it O
does O
38 O
- O
40 O
write O
when O
I O
copy O
files O
to O
my O
system O
. O

Pretty O
amazing O
. O

What O
I O
do O
believe O
though O
, O
is O
that O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

And O
takes O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
think O
to O
take O
only O
the O
necessary O
in O
sense O
of O
weight O
... O
no O
extra O
stuff O
... O

This O
means O
that O
you O
do O
not O
have O
much O
liberty O
with O
your O
laptop O
. O

Not O
a O
problem O
there O
either O
. O

One O
feature O
that O
I O
like O
a O
lot O
is O
the O
flash O
light O
. O

If O
you O
use O
a O
keyboard O
extensively O
ultrabooks O
are O
the O
way O
to O
go O
, O
but O
forget O
anything O
that O
offers O
a O
touchscreen O
feature O
it O
will O
just O
annoy O
you O
eventually O
... O

she O
just O
has O
to O
take O
or O
going O
places O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
are O
safe O
enough O
for O
my O
top O
of O
the O
line O
laptop O
. O

At O
least O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
, O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
yet O
travelled O
with O
it O
. O

About O
to O
hop O
back O
on O
FFXIV O
after O
two O
years O
and O
ran O
the O
benchmark O
test O
. O

Wires O
seem O
acceptable O
. O

Mac O
Book O
Pro O
's O
can O
get O
hot O
if O
you O
have O
one O
and O
know O
this O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
buying O
a O
spare O
power O
supply O
. O

This O
mini O
- O
powerstrip O
allows O
me O
to O
bring O
fewer O
outlet O
type O
adapters O
. O

This O
has O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
best O
products O
on O
the O
market O
. O

" O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

Only O
con O
is O
there O
is O
a O
little O
glare O
, O
but O
not O
bad O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
use O
to O
do O
her O
school O
work O
at O
home O
. O

great O
back O
pack O
for O
DSLR O
's O
and O
other O
cameras O
or O
even O
camcorders O
will O
fit O
into O
this O
bag O
. O

I O
have O
the O
wireless O
& O
wired O
version O
inone O
, O
and O
I O
can O
only O
get O
the O
wired O
configuration O
to O
work O
( O
though O
Ibought O
it O
to O
specifically O
use O
for O
wireless O
connectivity O
) O
. O

But O
these O
are O
minor O
quibbles O
and O
do O
not O
jeopardize O
the O
five O
star O
rating O
this O
very O
well O
- O
priced O
product O
deserves O
. O

I O
saved O
about O
$ O
300 O
from O
switching O
from O
paper O
textbook O
to O
eTextbook O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
I O
need O
a O
larger O
tablet O
to O
go O
with O
it O

And O
Roocase O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
respond O
when O
you O
try O
to O
get O
them O
to O
honor O
their O
warranty O
! O

Once O
installed O
you O
are O
up O
and O
running O
. O

It O
sometimes O
hangs O
in O
the O
fabric O
underneath O
and O
the O
zipper O
even O
& O
# O
34;derailed&#34 O
; O
and O
jammed O
once O
which O
took O
quite O
an O
effort O
to O
get O
back O
on O
track O
. O

totally O
a O
hidden O
gem O
. O

It O
's O
been O
several O
months O
now O
and O
the O
PC O
has O
not O
restarted O
itself O
EXCEPT O
one O
hot O
day O
during O
summer O
. O

While O
the O
chromebook O
is O
targeted O
at O
Google O
users O
it O
works O
just O
as O
well O
accessing O
Outlook O
. O

The O
only O
draw O
back O
to O
this O
model O
is O
the O
analog O
tuner O
. O

It O
's O
ultra O
light O
. O

I O
can O
fit O
my O
laptop O
, O
camcorder O
, O
digital O
camera O
, O
and O
all O
needed O
accessories O
in O
this O
bag O
and O
it O
is O
still O
a O
light O
load O
and O
comfortable O
when O
traveling O
through O
airports O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
gon O
na O
even O
gon O
na O
bother O
asking O
for O
it O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
for O
the O
pouch O
. O

So O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
the O
same O
but O
from O
my O
laptop O
, O
to O
do O
so O
, O
I O
come O
to O
amazaon O
again O
and O
I O
found O
this O
Kinivo O
bluetooth O
, O
and O
I O
decide O
to O
give O
a O
try O
. O

For O
anything O
not O
blu O
- O
ray O
, O
I O
use O
VLC O
( O
a O
free O
movie O
/ O
music O
player O
that O
will O
play O
basically O
anything O
) O
. O

will O
rate O
it O
higher O
when O
i O
have O
it O
a O
little O
longer O
, O
right O
now O
to O
early O
to O
tell O
, O
seems O
nice O
but O
will O
wait O

There O
is O
no O
compatibility O
concerns O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
compartments O
for O
storing O
items O
of O
all O
sizes O
, O
from O
the O
power O
brick O
to O
flash O
drives O
. O

Plastic O
melts O
... O

The O
screen O

up O

which O
I O
also O
liked O

It O
's O
just O
sort O
of O
a O
visual O

A O
big O
downside O
is O
no O
android O

I O
recently O
bought O
both O
this O
( O
the O
tx O
transmitter O
) O
and O
the O
RX O
( O
receiver O
) O
. O

Though O
not O
light O
when O
empty O
( O
3 O
pounds O
) O
, O
the O
bag O
is O
sized O
for O
airline O
carryon O
and O
travels O
well O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
contact O
Amazon O
about O
sending O
it O
back O
, O
but O
that O
would O
mean O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
a O
computer O
for O
days O
because O
I O
disposed O
of O
the O
old O
battery O
. O

I O
even O
ended O
up O
purchasing O
an O
additional O
power O
adapter O
for O
another O
hard O
drive O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
a O
new O
cable O
. O

I O
have O
a O
Dell O
Latitude O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
charger O
for O
and O
at O
first O
I O
had O
a O
charger O
that O
would O
not O
charge O
the O
battery O
up O
. O

Only O
a O
novice O
without O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
webcams O
would O
purchase O
this O
device O
. O

first O
the O
good O
. O

The O
selling O
point O
behind O
this O
Ultra O
Slim O
Aluminium O
series O

This O
keeps O
up O
with O
and O
even O
tops O
off O
my O
MBPR O
without O
killing O
my O
car O
battery O
. O

So O
I O
have O
a O
huge O
desktop O
at O
home O

With O
the O
13dbi O
antennas O
, O
this O
number O
went O
to O
over O
thirty O
wifi O
signals O
. O

On O
the O
17 O
" O
form O
factor O
, O
it O
's O
very O
nice O
on O
my O
old O
eyes O
. O

I O
like O
the O
early O
/ O
lengthy O
warning O
. O

So O
this O
squeezed O
the O
horizontal O
/ O
landscape O
view O
shots O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
an O
acceptable O
compromise O
. O

Yeah O
the O
trackball O
is O
n't O
fantastic O
, O
as O
other O
reviewers O
have O
said O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
25 O
$ O
mouse O
. O

It O
gets O
the O
job O
done O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
from O
a O
functionality O
standpoint O
! O

It O
also O
did O
n't O
take O
as O
long O
as O
estimated O
to O
get O
here O
( O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
take O
a O

only O
took O
about O
10 O

1/4th O
the O

a O

the O
first O
one O
I O
had O
suffered O
complete O
hardware O
failure O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

I O
chosed O
the O
4 O
and O
not O
the O
5 O
because O
, O
the O
5 O
, O
is O
almost O
twice O
as O
costly O
as O
the O
intuous O

is O
. O

Yes O
I O
like O
this O
better O
than O
the O
tablets O
I O
have O
. O

The O
sound O
playing O
off O
the O
card O
is O
great O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
getting O
a O
strange O
glitch O
between O
albums O
, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
being O
caused O
by O
invisible O
Mac O
files O
. O

It O
will O
actually O
burn O
you O
if O
you O
touch O
it O
while O
charging O
. O

I O
found O
connecting O
with O
the O
wireless O
network O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
buggy O
and O
not O
the O
instant O
connection O
I O
expected O
. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
carrying O
any O
really O
heavy O
loads O
, O
so O
the O
strap O
has O
worked O
fine O
, O
but O
I O
see O
in O
a O
couple O
other O
reviews O
people O
had O
the O
strap O
clips O
break O
on O
them O
. O

so O
i O
skipped O
that O
product O
and O
came O
upon O
this O
one O
. O

The O
base O
is O
wide O
yet O
the O
top O
is O
gently O
curved O
, O
supporting O
the O
hand O
in O
a O
totally O
comfortable O
position O
. O

The O
battery O
cover O
is O
flimsy O
, O
and O
the O
opening O
mechanism O
is O
poorly O
designed O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
my O
computer O
will O
read O
that O
it O
's O
charging O
and O
then O
dim O
because O
it O
says O
it O
's O
not O
charging O
even O
though O
it O
's O
still O
plugged O
in O
. O

They O
are O
not O
any O
high O
end O
, O
computer O
speakers O
by O
no O
means O
at O
38W O
of O
power O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
looks O
, O
but O
come O
on O
LaCie O
. O

I O
bought O
the O
same O
super O
capacity O
battery O
from O
another O
vendor O
last O
year O
and O
only O
got O
2 O
hours O
per O
charge O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
prefer O
the O
matte O
screen O
, O
especially O
photo O
buffs O
. O

So O
I O
just O
went O
wireless O
. O

Windows O

is O
like O
the O
Vista O
or O
ME O
dismal O
failures O
, O
hard O
to O
use O
and O
unstable O

It O
works O
fine O
, O
but O
now O
the O
capacity O
has O
decreased O
almost O
nearly O
1 O
. O
5 O
yrs O
after O
purchasing O
- O
still O
I O
get O
easily O
2 O
. O
5 O
hrs O

This O
cooling O

is O

to O
keep O

I O
am O
now O
looking O
at O
the O
X O
- O
Mini O
Max O
speakers O
for O
portablility O

First O
of O
all O
and O
perhaps O
most O
important O
to O
people O
with O

4 O
" O
laptops O

this O

fits O
my O
average O

sized O

To O
summarize O
, O
here O
is O
a O
list O
of O
my O
" O
Pros O
" O
& O
" O
Cons O
" O
for O
these O
Altec O
Lansing O
speakers O
: O
PROS O
> O

The O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
front O
facing O
camera O
is O
blocked O
. O

I O
wanted O
different O
colors O
so O
that O
I O
could O
tell O
the O
drives O
apart O
, O
but O
these O
are O
completely O
useless O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
you O
still O
have O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
storage O
space O
inside O
the O
case O
: O
you O
could O
probably O
hold O
your O
sunglasses O
, O
wallet O
, O
and O
cell O
phone O
in O
there O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
returned O
this O
item O
. O

but O
I O
would O
n't O
even O
have O
noticed O
if O
I O
had O
n't O
read O
that O
on O
others O
' O
posts O
. O

You O
should O
think O
about O
getting O
a O
longer O
USB O
and O
HDMI O
cord O
for O
use O
. O

Movie O
played O
clean O
and O
clear O
. O

This O
TV O
is O
great O
and O
it O
's O
even O
better O
because O
of O
the O
price O
, O
Sears O
is O
pricing O
this O
puppy O
for O
( O
... O
) O
. O

Would O
buy O
again O
. O

First O
product O
was O
delivered O
quick O
. O

The O
battery O
is O
very O
small O
, O
around O
3 O
hours O
of O
usage O
, O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
going O
to O
have O
it O
plugged O
in O
, O
if O
not O
, O
you O
may O
need O
to O
spend O
the O
extra O
$ O
50 O
and O
get O
the O
Samsung O
Chromebook O
which O
has O
a O
6 O
hour O
battery.- O

3GHz O
Built O
- O
To O
- O
Order O
machine O
( O
MacBookPro O
8 O
, O
2).In O
my O
machine O

and O
that O
's O
using O
six O
AA O
batteries O
. O

The O
battery O
life O
is O
pretty O
on O
the O
weak O
side O
, O
but O
as O
mentioned O
, O
it O
is O
a O
gaming O
laptop O
. O

Just O
a O
note O
.. O
the O
" O
mocha O
" O
color O
is O
barely O
noticeable O
, O
it O
actually O
looks O
dark O
gray O
. O

The O
delete O
key O
works O
intermittently O
. O

The O
neoprene O
bag O
has O
hardly O
any O
padding O
and O
seems O
like O
it O
would O
n't O
absorb O
any O
significant O
shocks O
. O

Overall O
though O
, O
a O
nice O
portable O
Bluetooth O
speaker O
set O
with O
good O
sound O
quality O
given O
the O
size O
, O
weight O
, O
and O
price O
. O

That O
is O
n't O
really O
bad O
, O
it O
just O
makes O
it O
a O
little O
bit O
awkward O
to O
hold O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
all O
the O
computers O
I O
've O
owned O
and O
used O
that O
I O
've O
had O
to O
calibrate O
a O
screen O
. O

The O
temp O
has O
dropped O
from O
around O
76C O
to O
around O
58C O
which O
is O
very O
impressive O
indeed O
. O

You O
need O
the O
RCA O
or O
HDMI O
cable O
to O
connect O
to O
your O
tv O

The O
product O
itself O
gets O
very O
hot O
. O

After O
a O
month O
it O
started O
making O
strange O
noises O
, O
I O
had O
to O
unmount O
it O
and O
unplug O
it O
. O

And O
by O
that O
I O
mean O
the O
build O
quality O
on O
this O
thing O
is O
outrageously O
good O
. O

I O
find O
that O
oddly O
appealing O
from O
an O
estetics O
point O
of O
view O
. O

With O
the O
volume O
all O
the O
way O
up O
on O
my O
IPAD2 O
, O
I O
could O
adjust O
the O
volume O
easily O
by O
just O
touching O
the O
right O
side O
earpiece O
softly O
. O

I O
contacted O
amazon O
and O
was O
told O
to O
contact O
customer O
support O
at O
Samsung O
. O

I O
broke O
my O
flex O
cable O
while O
replacing O
the O
screen O
and O
found O
this O
one O
at O
a O
great O
. O

Is O
it O
the O
$ O
999 O
64 O
GB O
model O
? O

I O
could O
not O
get O
it O
to O
work O
- O
NOTHING O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
I O
'm O
willing O
to O
put O
up O
with O
a O
little O
product O
placement O
. O

It O
's O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
Toyota O
problem O
( O
which O
I O
just O
had O
fixed O
at O
company O
expense O
) O
. O

Even O
when O
turned O
up O
much O
louder O
, O
the O
sound O
it O
still O
pretty O
good O
with O
very O
little O
to O
no O
noise O
or O
distortion O
from O
the O
speakers O
. O

It O
has O
n't O
failed O
yet O
though O
so O
that O
s O
good O
for O
the O
price O
we O
paid O
. O

I O
simply O
inserted O
the O
mini O
CD O
that O
came O
with O
the O
adapter O
and O
the O
dongle O
installed O
quickly O
from O
there O
. O

It O
has O
problems O
detecting O
the O
fan O
causing O
it O
to O
bluescreen O
and O
crash O
over O
this O
while O
running O
about O
3 O
times O
per O
week O
and O
still O
can O
not O
run O
the O
fingerprint O
reader O
. O

Toshiba O
wanted O
over O
100 O
dollars O
for O
a O
battery O
from O
them O
, O
I O
only O
paid O
a O
little O
over O
300 O
for O
the O
laptop O
which O
will O
last O
me O
a O
good O
long O
time O
for O
what O
I O
do O
on O
it O
that O
it O
seemed O
stupid O
to O
spend O
the O
100 O
+ O
dollars O
on O
it O
. O

and O
my O
4 O
lenses O
and O
a O
Mic O
in O
the O
lower O
compartment O
. O

The O
non O
- O
glare O
LCD O
is O
easy O
on O
the O
eyes O
, O
although O
dimmer O
than O
other O
non O
- O
glare O
LCD O
's O
I O
've O
seen O
( O
this O
is O
likely O
not O
due O
to O
age O
, O
since O
I O
read O
similar O
comments O
written O
back O
in O
2007 O
when O
the O
T61 O
was O
first O
released O
) O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
TV O
after O
my O
seven O
year O
old O
Toshiba O
HD O
projection O
TV O
died O
. O

; O
HP O
LT O
. O

It O
does O
what O
I O
need O
it O
to O
do O
, O
and O
for O
that O
I O
am O
happy O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
your O
video O
card O
does O
n't O
cover O
up O
your O
slot O
like O
mine O
did O
. O

After O
having O
preciously O
purchased O
one O
of O
these O
from O
another O
vendor O
and O
having O
to O
return O
it O
for O
lack O
of O
a O
driver O
, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
leery O
. O

increments O
yet O

It O
is O
too O
big O
for O
a O
13 O
inch O
and O
too O
small O
for O
a O
15 O
inch O

I O
'm O
a O
professional O
photographer O
and O
finally O
made O
the O
leap O
from O
using O
a O
desktop O
system O
to O
a O
single O
notebook O
for O
everything O
. O

This O
cable O
works O

" O

4 O

I O
've O
connected O
it O
to O
two O
brands O
of O

at O
home O
and O
wall O
mounted O
flat O

at O
work O
. O

Want O
to O
buy O
it O

battery O
i O

got O

I O
would O
highly O
commend O
it O
just O
for O
the O
comfort O
of O
the O
keyboard O
and O
the O
nice O
back O
lit O

. O

Granted O
, O
the O
NolaN O

does O
not O

any O

Worked O
good O
but O
heavy O
after O
a O
little O
while O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
pay O
enough O
attention O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
larger O
since O
it O
's O
a O
6 O
cell O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

Next O
, O
I O
found O
a O
single O
ZIP O
file O
at O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
website O
, O
containing O
only O
2 O
drivers O
( O
again O
, O
no O
easy O
instructions O
of O
which O
one O
should O
be O
used O
, O
however O
, O
it O
's O
easier O
to O
pick O
one O
between O
2 O
instead O
of O
between O
10 O
from O
the O
CD).After O
installing O
one O
of O
the O
drivers O
, O
I O
stopped O
getting O
blue O
- O
screen O
, O
but O
Windows O
reported O
issues O
on O
one O
of O
the O
USB O
ports O
. O

Very O
bad O
for O
trying O
to O
find O
buttons O
in O
the O
dark O
or O
through O
eyes O
that O
have O
n't O
adjusted O
to O
the O
morning O
light O
yet O
. O

Apps O
are O
always O
opened O
in O
a O
browser O
. O

So O
far O
2hrs O
of O
battery O
life O
& O
that O
s O
an O
improvement O
over O
my O
old O
batteryworth O
it O

But O
, O
you O
can O
play O
games O
on O
low O
, O
experience O
good O
video O
viewing O
, O
comfortable O
document O
processing O
, O
and O
fairly O
fast O
web O
surfing O
. O

Disregard O
the O
gamer O
look O
, O
it O
works O
perfectly O
in O
regular O
work O
situation O
( O
we O
do O
office O
documents O
, O
programming O
, O
design O
, O
video O
editing O
) O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
ordering O
them O
together O
again O
. O

Both O
ram O
( O
max O
12 O
gb O
) O
and O
2 O
. O
5 O
drive O
bay O
is O
accessible O
by O
unlocking O
a O
few O
screws O
. O

Great O
price O
. O

it O
's O
perfect O
for O
charging O
my O
GS3 O
in O
its O
Otterbox O
comuter O
using O
the O
Amazon O
brand O
2 O
. O

After O
having O
my O
laptop O
for O
2 O
years O
the O
battery O
totally O
went O
kapoot O
on O
me O
. O

Using O
a O
microSD O
card O
( O
I O
tested O
a O
16 O
GB O
one O
) O
filled O
with O
MP3s O
, O
you O
can O
playback O
music O
directly O
off O
the O
memory O
stick O
. O

This O
is O
what O
you O
need O
for O
your O
electronic O
devices O
to O
avoid O
a O
burnout O
or O
something O
getti O
fired O

It O
'll O
just O
stop O
working O
, O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
unplug O
it O
and O
plug O
back O
in O
, O
and O
then O
it O
'll O
work O
again O
for O
a O
little O
white O
. O

But O
the O
construction O
quality O
is O
quite O
poor O
for O
a O
brand O
- O
name O
product O
. O

I O
should O
have O
done O
this O
sooner O
. O

it O
's O
not O
made O
poorly O
) O
and O
it O
has O
lasted O
quite O
a O
while O
without O
& O
# O
34;going O
bad&#34 O
; O

It O
does O
have O
8 O
megapixels O
for O
a O
sharp O
clear O
image O
, O
though O
. O

I O
also O
tested O
it O
on O
video O
and O
gaming O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
say O
overall O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
average O

They O
were O
important O
keys O
( O
enter O
, O
backspace O
, O
escape O
, O
and O
more O
) O
so O
I O
had O
to O
do O
something O
. O

Must O
admit O
that O
I O
do O
revert O
to O
using O
a O
mouse O
when O
using O
the O
computer O
at O
home O
... O
call O
it O
years O
of O
conditioning O
. O

I O
also O
like O
that O
it O
's O
a O
homage O
to O
the O
original O
MBA O
unveiling O
. O

Loud O
speakers O
with O
great O
bass O
, O
mic O
works O
better O
than O
expected O
( O
noise O
canceling O
, O
only O
picks O
up O
voice O
and O
not O
typing/ O

This O
latter O
gesture O
was O
unnecessary O
on O
their O
part O
but O
very O
much O
appreciated O
. O

Boot O
time O
is O
less O
than O
10 O
seconds O
. O

So O
I O
called O
Apple O
to O
see O
what O
it O
would O
cost O
to O
repair O
, O
and O
after O
explaining O
the O
history O
the O
guy O
offered O
to O
repair O
it O
for O
free O
since O
they O
missed O
the O
problem O
when O
I O
sent O
it O
in O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
had O
Toshiba O
send O
me O
a O
replacement O
( O
they O
even O
shipped O
it O
overnight O
) O
and O
the O
new O
one O
does O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Edited O
to O
update O
: O
This O
mouse O
has O
held O
up O
well O
under O
a O
few O
years O
of O
constant O
use O
and O
abuse O
, O
and O
shows O
no O
signs O
of O
slowing O
down O
or O
wearing O
out O
. O

Still O
though O
, O
as O
a O
package O
deal O
, O
the O
speaker O
is O
bumping O
! O

The O
HF20 O
is O
a O
pretty O
great O
AVCHD O
camcorder O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
, O
and O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
share O
a O
couple O
things O
I O
noticed O
as O
well O
as O
a O
couple O
of O
add O
- O
ons O
that O
I O
've O
tested O
myself O
that O
greatly O
enhance O
the O
experience O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
though O
the O
company O
is O
based O
in O
France O
, O
they O
were O
very O
responsive O
to O
my O
e O
- O
mails O
and O
even O
offered O
to O
send O
me O
a O
new O
unit O
free O
of O
charge O
, O
including O
free O
return O
shipping O
, O
from O
one O
of O
their O
US O
distributors O
. O

( O
I O
know O
, O
who O
reads O
the O
manual O
these O
days O
? O

Actually O
, O
no O
shipping O
charge O
and O
fast O
, O
too O
. O

The O
key O
thing O
with O
any O
hub O
especially O
a O
usb O
3 O
hub O
is O
speed O
which O
I O
must O
say O
is O
amazing O
with O
this O
hub O
. O

I O
had O
to O
study O
the O
listings O
for O
this O
adapter O
carefully O
to O
determine O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
get O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
this O
to O
put O
in O
my O
Polaroid O
250 O
Land O
Camera O
, O
and O
it O
works O
wonderfully O
. O

I O
'm O
the O
type O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
couch O
and O
use O
the O
computer O
. O

Overall O
, O
has O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
cheap O
feel O
to O
it O
. O

Installed O
this O
in O
a O
system O
that O
dual O
boots O
Ubuntu O
12 O
. O
04 O
and O
Win O
XP O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
need O
a O
long O
VGA O
with O
audio O
to O
VGA O
then O
this O
item O
is O
perfectly O
acceptable O
and O
at O
a O
good O
price O
. O

, O
JUST O
fits O
in O
my O
bag O
. O

Or O
stop O
producing O
this O
adapter O
because O
it O
is O
just O
not O
working O
. O

Some O
issues O
if O
you O
use O
it O
unplugged O
. O

Poor O
battery O
life O
. O

As O
long O
as O
your O
expectations O
are O
n't O
too O
high O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
perfectly O
happy O
with O
this O
. O

On O
such O
an O
awesome O
laptop O
, O
Win O
8 O
is O
really O
a O
waste O
( O
Its O
good O
for O
touch O
screen O
laptops O
but O
not O
for O
non O
- O
touch O
one O
's O
) O
. O

It O
's O
good O
- O
looking O
. O

Works O
just O
fine O
, O
and O
I O
like O
the O
angled O
tip O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
straight O
one O
of O
the O
OEM O
charger O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
loaded O
with O
features O
: O
fancy O
touch O
buttons O
, O
a O
built O
in O
webcam O
, O
a O
fingerprint O
reader O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
've O
made O
the O
switch O
to O
this O
Toshiba O
Satellite O
for O
the O
bargain O
price O
of O
$ O
749 O
and O
I O
do O
not O
regret O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

My O
first O
try O
to O
buy O
a O
battery O
for O
a O
laptop O
( O
my O
wifes O
) O
and O
instead O
of O
ordering O
from O
Dell O
where O
i O
purchased O
my O
computer O
& O
laptop O
! O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
get O
what O
makes O
it O
a O
" O
magic O
" O
fiber O
, O
and O
why O
two O
pieces O
of O
cloth O
should O
cost O
$ O
6 O
. O

They O
must O
be O
of O
the O
7 O
mm O
variety O
. O

The O
whole O
idea O
of O
this O
" O
Rugged O
" O
drive O
is O
the O
protection O
from O
getting O
banged O
up O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
windows O
8 O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
starting O
to O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

and O
now O
it O
sits O
snuggly O
on O
the O
side O
of O
my O
computer O
tower.\Kinda O
wish O
they O
made O
this O
wire O
in O
various O
sizes O
cause O
for O
some O
of O
us O
, O
longer O
wire O
would O
actually O
be O
better O
. O

The O
zippers O
are O
heavy O
duty O
and O
work O
smoothly O
. O

I O
do O
still O
like O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
though O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
this O
amp O
with O
three O
headphones O
now O
( O
Etymotic O
ER4P-27 O
Ohm O
, O
Sennheiser O

so O
quiet O
you O
would O
never O
know O

This O
model O
only O
allows O
for O
one O
signal O
source O
. O

These O
just O
give O
the O
impression O
that O
they O
were O
put O
together O
by O
a O
company O
that O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
doing O
and O
cheaped O
out O
anyway O
. O

Also O
with O
USB O
port O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
will O
be O
enough O
power O
for O
cooling O
fan O
. O

Has O
been O
a O
wonderful O
replacement O
battery O
for O
my O
laptop O
. O

My O
photography O
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
sometimes O
, O
but O
the O
pictures O
all O
transfer O
to O
the O
computer O
without O
problems O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
good O
or O
bad O
the O
photographs O
are O
. O

The O
screen O
is O
bright O

clear O

But O
the O
Xboom O
, O
when O
folded O
, O
is O
a O
bit O
smaller O
and O
more O
compact O
, O
and O
it O
's O
On O

Off O
and O
Volume O

are O
easier O
to O

for O
most O
of O
my O
day O
to O
day O
computer O
work O
. O

It O
effectively O
acts O
as O
a O
tint O
over O
the O
light O
and O
makes O
it O
much O
less O
bright O
. O

when O
I O
first O
purchased O
this O
charger O
/ O
adapter O
, O
I O
would O
have O
given O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

The O
ergonomic O
design O
helps O
pulling O
this O
bag O
easily O
even O
with O
loads O
of O
stuff O
in O
it O
. O

You O
can O
zip O
the O
iPod O
inside O
the O
unit O
and O
control O
the O
volume O
, O
skip O
backward O
or O
forward O
through O
tracks O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
hide O
- O
away O
tripod O
holder O
works O
well O
when O
you O
need O
it O
, O
and O
is O
out O
of O
the O
way O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
currently O
use O
it O
for O
my O
flash O
drives O
and O
my O
over O
sized O
laptop O
charger O
and O
there O
is O
still O
plenty O
of O
room O
left O
to O
be O
used O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
. O

Great O
Price O
and O
an O
awesome O
monitor O
, O
thin O
, O
light O
and O
good O
colors O
, O
works O
for O
office O
or O
games O
well O
. O

So O
far O
everything O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
fine O
. O

This O
item O
was O
ordered O
on O
my O
account O
unbeknownst O
to O
me O

I O
might O
consider O
something O
like O
this O
for O
a O
user O
like O
my O
mother O
- O
someone O
who O
uses O
a O
computer O
only O
as O
a O
basic O

and O
little O
else O
. O

Toshiba O
Made O
it O

but O
I O
do O
like O
Itunes O
. O

There O
is O
no O
convenient O
place O
to O

the O
charger O
. O

This O
cover O
is O
ok O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
an O
incredibly O
tech O
savvy O
computer O
whiz O
, O
so O
stuff O
has O
to O
be O
easy O
or O
I O
do O
n't O
always O
get O
it O
. O

I O
have O
three O
desktops O
using O
quad O
core O
AMD O
processors O
for O
my O
animation O
hobby O
and O
boinc O

( O
which O
also O
sounds O
awesome O
btw O
and O
may O
be O
the O
actual O
best O
setting O
depending O
on O
the O
individual O
) O
and O
the O
purple O
setting O
which O
is O
like O
power O

had O
to O
return O
the O
product O
. O

VERY O
easy O

i O
am O
at O

that O
my O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
could O
be O

is O
if O
there O
was O
some O
additional O

WITH O
this O

I O

This O
is O
how O
many O
batteries O
go O
bad O
and O
may O
lead O
to O
poor O
reviews O
. O

The O
buttons O
are O
smallish O
and O
stiff O
so O
that O
might O
be O
part O
of O
the O
issue O
people O
had O
. O

We O
have O
this O
plugged O
into O
our O
laptop O
utilizing O
one O
of O
our O
laptop O
USB O
ports O
to O
power O
it O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
( O
and O
its O
really O
not O
bad O
) O
is O
that O
it O
gets O
quite O
warm O
. O

The O
installation O
instructions O
contained O
a O
few O
drawings O
and O
virtually O
no O
words O
. O

This O
is O
superior O
to O
the O
cheapest O
similar O
speakers O
I O
tried O
, O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
as O
good O
as O
the O
more O
premium O
ones O
. O

This O
netbook O

has O
some O
nice O
features O
over O
the O
one O
that O
I O
have O
been O
using O
from O
Amazon O
Basics O
. O

short O
, O
but O
works O
perfectly O
fine O
, O
seller O
was O
great O
, O
shipping O
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
I O
was O
n't O
in O
a O
hurry O
anyway O

Hopefully O
the O
next O
Xbox O
or O
PS4 O
will O
have O
better O
support O
for O
monitors O
. O

As O
long O
it O
's O
clear O
and O
not O
lagging O
, O
I O
'm O
happy O
. O

After O
a O
week O
with O
this O
laptop O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
I O
will O
be O
keeping O
it O
. O

If O
I O
stop O
watching O
a O
movie O
, O
it O
will O
go O
even O
faster O
. O

I O
'm O
using O
it O
to O

my O
Galaxy O

A O
few O
years O

I O
discovered O

The O
internet O
ever O
decides O
to O
not O
work O
on O
your O
chromebook O
, O
you O
could O
be O
in O
a O
tight O
spot O
of O
you O
need O
something O
from O
your O
docs O
in O
the O
one O
of O
the O
apps O
that O
is O
web O

I O
built O
a O

For O

other O
items O
you O
have O
that O
require O
less O
than O
100mA O
, O
or O
have O
their O
own O
power O
supply O
, O
you O
will O
not O
need O
to O
use O
the O

It O
plays O
great O
on O
my O

If O
I O
take O
a O
long O

I O
'll O
just O
buy O
a O
handful O
of O
SD O
chips O
, O
along O
with O
the O
two O
batteries O
I O
already O
own O
, O
and O
shoot O
away O

I O
found O
that O
I O
was O
often O
connecting O
USB O
connnectors O
to O
my O
laptop O
to O
perform O
these O
I O

O O

Easy O

Definitely O
the O
best O
value O
for O
your O
money O
for O
any O
purpose O
. O

My O
only O
real O
complaint O
is O
the O
CPU O
. O

So O
far O
no O
complaints O
! O

In O
fact O
my O
original O
review O
was O
already O
wary O
of O
wifi O
issues O

Most O
netbook O

feel O
so O

that O
I O
ca O
n't O

that O

increased O
for O
a O

but O
it O
did O
that O
before O
the O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
belkins O
does O
n't O
provide O
any O
firmware O
upgrade O
on O
this O
device O
. O

When O
I O
see O
that O
, O
I O
expect O
the O
item O
to O
come O
from O
Apple O
. O

You O
can O
double O
click O
the O
button O
to O
skip O
a O

I O
m O
curious O
if O
anyone O
else O
did O
the O
same O
thing O

Despite O
these O
minor O
shortcomings O
I O
find O
that O
I O
can O
take O
this O
on O
trips O

I O
used O
Dropbox O

of O
hard O
copy O

I O

When O
I O
double O
tap O
and O
drag O
the O

goes O
whereever O
it O
wants O
too O
. O

there O
also O
do O
n't O
work O
keyboard O
shortcuts O
for O
windows O
. O

The O
product O
absolutely O
does O
what O
I O
purchased O
it O
to O
do O
. O

so O
I O
can O
move O
the O
Xbox O
upstairs O
and O
stream O
from O
another O
DirecTV O
box O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
we O
have O
any O
service O
centers O
in O
your O
region O
. O

The O
box O
to O
start O
with O
, O
is O
a O
nice O
clear O
plastic O
box O
that O
can O
be O
reused O
for O
odds O
and O
ends O
. O

My O
machine O
detected O
it O
and O
installed O
the O

with O
out O
any O
extra O
work O
from O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
no O

guru O

HIGHLY O
recommend O
this O
- O
I O
bought O
2 O
and O
plan O
on O
buying O
a O
few O
more O
! O

I O
love O
the O
night O
light O
on O
the O
remote O
. O

These O
work O
pretty O
well O
with O
my O
Galaxy O
10 O
. O
1 O
tab O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
4 O
GB O
of O
RAM O
and O
the O
Haswell O
processor O
give O
the O
C720 O
enough O
horsepower O
to O
handle O
this O
load O
. O

While O
it O
takes O
the O
input O
from O
the O
102 O
buttons O
just O
fine O
, O
if O
you O
strum O
, O
the O
adapter O
dies O
. O

The O
velcro O
attachments O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
move O
equipment O
around O
to O
suit O
sizes O
, O
especially O
for O
lenses.- O

So O
far O
it O
has O
been O
working O
as O
expected O
for O
a O
great O
price O
. O

The O
bag O
is O
so O
well O
padded O
, O
however O
, O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
needed O
. O

The O
slickness O
on O
the O
bare O
screen O
makes O
my O
writing O
even O
messier O
than O
it O
already O
is O
. O

And O
did O
I O
say O
its O
fast O
, O

Though O
my O
daughter O
did O
n't O
believe O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
opened O
- O
she O
wanted O
to O
take O
a O
kitchen O
knife O
to O
it O
- O
and O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
burglar O
try O
to O
break O
into O
it O
- O
I'm O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
. O

80-Plus O
certification O
means O
the O
power O
supply O
runs O
efficiently O
, O
doing O
the O
best O
it O
can O
to O
use O
as O
little O
power O
as O
necessary O
so O
your O
utility O
bills O
do O
n't O
skyrocket O
. O

But O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
tall O
( O
about O
2 O
inches O
) O
so O
that O
might O
be O
an O
issue O
for O
some O
computer O
bags O
. O

I O
did O
a O
youtube O
look O
up O
on O
hdd O
v. O
s O

The O
cable O
lasted O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
then O
quit O
working O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
card O
for O
nearly O
a O
year O
now O

But O
it O
works O
perfect O
otherwise O
. O

So O
slow O
, O
you O
almost O
think O
it O
quit O
working O
. O

I O
wait O
3 O
months O
. O

So O
, O
in O
that O
spirit O
I O
will O
say O
: O
As O
much O
as O
I O
dislike O
Windows O
8 O
, O
the O
Dell O
Inspiron O
with O
its O
touchscreen O
seems O
to O
be O
exactly O
what O
Microsoft O
was O
hoping O
someone O
would O
build O
. O

99 O
computing O
device O
. O

however O
my O
wife O
and O
stepdaughter O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
the O
power O
that O
I O
get O
from O
this O
system O
especially O
when O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
sleep O
. O

So O
it O
appears O
to O
me O
that O
incorporating O
a O
small O
battery O
is O
a O
simple O
solution O
. O

I O
wanted O
one O
for O
my O
Surface O
as O
well O
, O
it O
's O
the O
new O
Surface O
2 O
- O
not O
& O
# O
34;officially&#34 O

supported O

Linux O
was O
a O

allows O
you O
to O

size O

I O
game O
a O

and O
if O
your O
on O
the O
fence O
trying O
to O
determine O
if O
I O
should O
upgrade O
memory O
or O
not O
, O
upgrade O
. O

yeah O
can&#34;t O
wait O
till O
I O
get O
it O

The O
laptop O
has O
32 O
GM O
maximum O
memory O
installation O
slots O
, O
and O
2 O
hard O
drive O
bay O
, O
this O
is O
really O
cool.(3 O
) O

This O
was O
a O
lot O
cheaper O
than O
ones O
sold O
by O
Apple O
. O

There O
are O
three O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
ports O
, O
which O
is O
a O
lot O
for O
an O
ultrabook O
. O

It O
works O
on O
all O
three O
, O
and O
they O
've O
been O
working O
for O
a O
month O
. O

I O
have O
a O
few O
graphic O
intense O
layouts O
to O
get O
to O

this O
is O
a O
bright O
LED O
light O
. O

The O
mid O
- O
range O
and O
high O
- O
range O
sounds O
are O
acceptable O
, O
but O
the O
lower O
range O
of O
the O
sub O
- O
woofer O
is O
boomy O
, O
not O
acceptable O
to O
persons O
who O
are O
used O
to O
listening O
to O
good O
speakers O
' O
sound O
. O

Would O
not O
buy O
again O
. O

I O
definitely O
recommend O
for O
psp O
gamers O
as O
well O
as O
for O
phones O
, O
pda O
's O
, O
laptops O
, O
etc O
. O

Mind O
you O
, O
I O
rarely O
used O
my O
laptop O
off O
AC O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
I O
returned O
the O
Rii O
mini O
i13 O
is O
that O
the O
battery O
simply O
does O
n't O
hold O
a O
charge O
. O

I O
have O
decided O
to O
keep O
it O
. O

And O
if O
you O
need O
more O
buttons O
than O
the O
22 O
provided O
, O
assign O
a O
button O
on O
your O
mouse O
to O
ctrl O
or O
alt O
for O
a O
modifier O
. O

High O
quality O
. O

The O
color O
is O
true O
to O
the O
picture O
, O
which O
I O
got O
purple O
and O
it O
's O
more O
of O
a O
lavender O
( O
as O
shown O
) O
. O

The O
charger O
is O
working O
fine O
and O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

so O
it O
was O
an O
ok O
investment O

I O
turned O
on O
all O
the O
equipments O
simultanously O
and O
worked O
for O
more O
than O
a O
few O
hours O
daily O
for O
2 O
weeks O
. O

It O
was O
dead O
on O
arrival O
. O

We O
have O
had O
the O
printer O
for O
about O
a O
month O
with O
very O
moderate O
printing O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
black O
cartridges O
is O
already O
drained O
. O

If O
you O
leave O
it O
attached O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
when O
not O
in O
use O
it O
does O
get O
very O
hot O
. O

Could O
go O
either O
way O
on O
this O
one O
. O

This O
has O
turend O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
reliable O
computer O
. O

So O
for O
$ O
1299 O
and O
an O
extra O
hundred O
, O
I O
have O
a O
macbook O
that O
rivals O
my O
desktop O
. O

But O
that O
s O
a O
small O
price O
to O
pay O
. O

Hope O
I O
helped O
! O

Very O
fine O
threads O
take O
extreem O
care O
to O
screw O
together O
, O
but O
when O
done O
correctly O
you O
have O
a O
tight O
sealed O
fit O
. O

the O
images O
of O
the O
various O
VMs O
I O
run O
on O
the O
laptop).All O
said O
, O
this O
was O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

Its O
pretty O
loud O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
with O
it O
so O
far O
and O
for O
my O
purposes O
the O
cable O
is O
long O
enough O
too O
with O
room O
to O
spare O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
device O
that O
is O
a O
laptop O
and O
are O
n't O
wanting O
to O
waste O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
! O

This O
rating O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
dealer O
. O

I O
like O
the O
design O
, O
and O
it O
fits O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
my O
case O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
bag O
. O

The O
first O
i O
had O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
before O
the O
drive O
failed O

Avoid O
this O
product O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
shut O
the O
machine O
down O
before O
pulling O
the O
USB O
cable O
just O
to O
be O
safe O
. O

but O
it O
is O
a O
good O
addition O
to O
my O
stuff O
& O
# O

; O

Setting O
up O
the O
shares O
were O
pretty O
easy O
, O
but O
do O
require O
testing O
so O
go O
easy O
if O
you O
have O
secured O
data O
. O

So O
I O
needed O
to O
put O
it O
next O
to O
the O
window O
more O
than O
1 O
week O
. O

Keep O
shopping O
! O

Therefore O
I O
am O
changing O
the O
rating O
to O
5 O
stars O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
competing O
brand O
of O
cooling O
pad O
and O
while O
it O
worked O
okay O
, O
the O
fan O
still O
ran O
continuously O
and O
eventually O
the O
cord O
that O
plugs O
into O
the O
USB O
frayed O
and O
broke O
. O

Since O
I O
have O
Amazon O
Prime O

Good O
for O
the O
money O
although O
it O
could O
have O
used O
a O
little O
more O
padding O
on O
the O
inside O

Antonline O
, O
the O
seller O
of O
this O
product O
, O
has O
so O
far O
only O
replied O
to O
my O
refund O
request O
with O
an O
auto O
- O
generated O
" O
send O
it O
back O
to O
the O
manufacturer O
for O
warranty O

Only O
problem O
I O
had O
was O
when O
I O
watched O
a O
movie O
. O

Sadly O
I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
who O
require O
a O
performance O
notebook O
cooler O
, O
but O
besides O
that O
fact O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
notebook O
coolers O
ever O
created O
. O

Although O
some O
feel O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
real O
leather O
look O
I O
think O
it O
has O
a O
very O
professional O
look O
. O

It O
is O
poorly O
built O
, O
so O
even O
though O
it O
fits O
, O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
keys O
go O
slightly O
up O
, O
which O
makes O
typing O
a O
pain O
because O
it O
really O
slows O
you O
down O
. O

No O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
sound O
like O
a O
stereo O
system O
but O
the O
sound O
is O
much O
better O
than O
you O
might O
expect O
. O

I O
pulled O
off O
the O
back O
cover O
and O
tightened O
a O
screw O
that O
held O
it O
in O
place O
. O

The O
corners O
of O
this O
case O
is O
more O
rounded O
than O
the O
Transformer O
, O
so O
although O
there O
's O
1/2 O
" O
extra O
on O
both O
of O
the O
sides O
, O
the O
corner O
just O
fits O
. O

Our O

Did O

what O
everyone O
was O

My O
original O
review O
of O
this O
product O
had O
indicated O
it O
would O
work O
... O
but O
we O
quickly O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
giving O
us O
problems O
. O

Even O
better O
, O
it O
activates O
with O
a O
simple O
button O
press O
on O
front O
of O
the O
tablet O
to O
switch O
between O
pen O

lightweight O

great O

I O
like O

not O

I O
am O

Those O

back O
here O

If O
things O
go O
bad O
I O
will O
add O
that O
to O
this O
review O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
them O
for O
all O
your O
notebook O
replacement O
needs O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
device O
that O
functions O
well O
in O
either O
tablet O
or O
laptop O
mode O
. O

They O
really O
had O
three O
different O
drivers O
( O
Sides O
, O
Rear O
, O
and O
fronts O
) O
and O
sub O
that O
convinced O
me O
pretty O
well O
where O
things O
were O
at O
and O
bumped O
as O
well O
. O

I O
can O
also O
see O
myself O
using O
this O
on O
stateside O
trips O
though O
, O
because O
I O
never O
can O
find O
enough O
outlets O
in O
a O
hotel O
room O
. O

This O
was O
cheap O
enough O
that O
I O
could O
buy O
this O
and O
use O
it O
as O
a O
second O
BT O
keyboard O
if O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
out O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
to O
see O
that O
new O
touchscreen O
laptops O
are O
coming O
out O
. O

ASUS O
absolutely O
would O
not O
mail O
me O
the O
replacement O
clip O
, O
they O
would O
only O
accept O
a O
return O
for O
repair O
. O

This O
cable O
is O
nice O
quality O
, O
and O
is O
nicely O
priced O
. O

If O
you O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
smaller O
laptop O
like O
a O
13 O
" O
one O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
getting O
the O
small O
. O

But O
due O
to O
the O
size O
, O
I O
keep O
this O
on O
a O
table O
. O

I O
've O
been O
using O
this O
& O
# O
34;hybrid&#34 O
; O
drive O
for O
almost O
two O
months O
. O

I O
just O
had O
to O
press O
where O
the O
clips O
were O
to O
make O
it O
stay O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
experience O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
battery O
is O
adequate O
my O
Tripps O

its O
not O
super O
tight O
the O
cord O
falls O
out O
frequently.*Pros O

all O
- O
in O
- O
one O
PC O
that O
did O
n't O
have O
bluetooth O

I O
was O
really O
suprised O
about O
how O
hefty O
the O
design O
is O
. O

The O
hard O
drive O
is O
not O
very O
secure O
once O
inserted O

somewhat O
floppy O
, O
but O
as O
long O
as O
you O
wo O
n't O
tounch O
it O
during O

, O
it O
should O
be O
fine O

( O
You O

to O
start O
, O
well O
the O
13&#34 O
; O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O

but O
that O
's O
not O
why O
I O
bought O
the O
Chromebook O
. O

I O
was O
expecting O
more O
but O
ca O
n't O
complaint O

You O
can O
inset O
an O
sd O
card O
easily O
by O
lifting O
the O
docked O
macbook O
and O
going O
from O
under O
to O
slip O
in O
the O
memory O
card O
, O
however O
there O
is O
a O
shape O
cut O
out O
to O
fit O
the O
sd O
card O
and O
comes O
down O
inches O
so O
while O
you O
can O
push O
a O
card O
in O
while O
docked O
, O
it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
remove O
it O
unles O
your O
using O
tweezers O
. O

Contrary O
to O
what O
I O
had O
read O
in O
Windows O
7 O
reviews O
, O
it O
's O
much O
more O
resource O
- O
intensive O
than O
XP O
. O

This O
model O
does O
NOT O
have O
Bluetooth O
. O

Overall O
, O
even O
with O
just O
connecting O
to O
my O
& O
# O
34;N&#34 O
; O
network O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
performance O
and O
reception O
... O

Maybe O
the O
price O
is O
so O
low O
here O
because O
they O
are O
discontinuing O
it O
. O

This O
is O
concerning O
seeing O
as O
it O
will O
most O
likely O
get O
sat O
on O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

I O
've O
had O
problems O
with O
my O
Google O
password O
in O
the O
past O

I O
now O
get O
over O
2 O
hours O
of O
power O
, O
which O
is O
as O
good O
as O
when O
I O
first O
got O
my O
laptop O
. O

Massive O
CFM O
but O
quiet O
flow O
. O

I O
have O
had O
monster O
cable O
ipod O
versions O
of O
this O
product O
and O
there O
was O
always O
a O
high O
pitch O

. O

The O
G13 O
handles O
like O
a O

of O

with O
a O
palm O
rest O
and O
odd O
key O

The O

Now O
they O

until O
I O
heard O
a O

Sparse O
instructions O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
intended O
purpose O
for O
some O
straps O
& O
pockets O
. O

This O
item O
has O
worked O
exactly O
as O
expected O
without O
a O
hitch O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
about O
6 O

is O

a O

further O
prevents O

If O
it O

I O
will O
try O

I O
keep O

Getting O
rid O
of O
the O
extra O

requires O
additional O

is O
a O
chore O
. O

It O
's O
thin O
enough O

light O
enough O
to O
take O
with O
you O
if O
you O
have O
a O
decent O
size O

out O

Finding O
the O
name O
and O
type O
of O
the O
mini O
- O
port O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
machine O
is O
similarly O
impossible O
: O
although O
the O
user O
guide O
shows O
the O
front O
, O
left O
, O
and O
rights O
sides O
of O
the O
computer O
with O
the O
names O
of O
all O
the O
ports O
, O
they O
completely O
forgot O
to O
show O
the O
rear O
view O
, O
which O
is O
where O
the O
port O
in O
question O
is O
located O
! O

It O
worked O
for O
me O
but O
USB O
connector O
was O
loose O
and O
had O
to O
adjust O
few O
times O
before O
it O
started O
working O
. O

She O
had O
left O
1/2 O
of O
this O
2-piece O
unit O
at O
home O
( O
the O
cord O
from O
the O
adapter O
to O
the O
wall O
outlet O
) O
, O
and O
nothing O
I O
had O
would O
fit O
. O

so O
it O
's O
just O
a O
minor O
issue O
as O
mentioned O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
prefer O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
thin O
and O
lightweight O
. O

So O
sorry O
, O
30 O
day O
return O
policy O
. O

Works O
just O
as O
good O
, O
if O
not O
better O

the O

The O

, O
have O
been O

I O
'm O

that O

but O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
with O
both O
my O

so O
far O
without O
issue O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
NOT O
worth O
$ O
25 O
. O

The O
sound O
was O
somewhat O
weak O
and O
had O
a O
rattling O
sound O
( O
with O
one O
or O
both O
speakers O
working).For O
the O
price O
, O
I O
expected O
much O
more O
, O
especially O
considering O
what O
I O
had O
paid O
for O
my O
first O
speakers O
- O
AND O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
first O
set O
lasted O
so O
long O
, O
I O
was O
disappointed O
that O
this O
set O
did O
n't O
even O
last O
ONE O
HOUR O
! O

It O
is O
very O
well O
made O
and O
fits O

perfectly O

it O

, O
I O
do O
n't O
find O
that O
this O

works O
any O
better O

Laptops O
were O
easily O
to O

overheated O
with O

, O
this O

has O
2 O
fans O
just O
enough O

to O
cool O
your O

even O

although O
did O

just O
playing O

on O

it O

It O
is O
so O
wonderful O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
have O
any O
additional O
wiring O
in O
my O
projects O
. O

Have O
n't O
tried O
the O
Apple O
drivers O

Hanging O
wire O
is O
bit O
annoying O

This O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
at O
first O
. O

Most O
laptop O
coolers O
are O
simply O
plastic O
and O
quite O
uncomfortable O
for O
lap O
use O
, O
but O
the O
N200 O
delivers O
here O
in O
spades O
. O

However O
I O
have O
many O
other O
woven O
covers O
that O
do O
not O
have O
this O
problem O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
a O
bunch O
of O
cases O
for O
this O
tablet O
and O
most O
have O
been O
a O
complete O
fail O
. O

She O
was O
told O
the O
battery O
was O
going O
to O
be O
over O
$ O
100 O
for O
the O
replacement O
. O

Four O
days O
ago O
Google O
decided O
to O
& O
# O
34;upgrade&#34 O
; O
Chrome O
and O
now O
external O
monitors O
have O
stopped O
working O
. O

The O
only O
information O
different O
in O
its O
description O
here O
is O
" O
87Wh O
" O
instead O
of O
" O
8000mah O

I O
solved O
this O
by O
going O
online O
to O
find O
a O
picture O
and O
downloading O
it O
for O
future O
use O
. O

if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
buy O
this O
, O
you O
must O
get O
the O
high O
res O
& O
anti O
- O
glare O
for O
$ O
150 O
extra O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
travel O
adapter O
for O
my O
HPDV6 O
- O
6110us O
laptop O
. O

i O
did O
order O
a O
wireless O
mouse O
( O
amazon O
has O
one O
on O
sale O
for O
% O
55 O
off O
right O
now O
, O
so O
right O
at O
$ O
12 O
with O
free O
shipping O
) O
and O
an O
external O
usb O
speaker O
that O
clamps O
onto O
the O
top O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

They O
always O
point O
at O
the O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
or O
the O
keyboard O
with O
num O
pad O
, O
I O
had O
both O

so O
I O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
battery O
. O

For O
travel O
to O
, O
say O
, O
Japan O
, O
which O
has O
two O
- O
pronged O
outlets O
, O
you O
will O
need O
some O
kind O
of O
adapter O

I O
would O
still O
recomend O
this O
Little O
work O
horse O
for O
is O
Price O
design O
and O
very O
minor O
problems O
. O

These O
are O
amazing O
little O
locks O
. O

Also O
the O
straps O
on O
the O
inside O
are O
nice O
to O
keep O
things O
from O
moving O
around O
. O

I O
use O
a O

and O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
decent O
well O
built O
case O
in O
which O
to O
transport O
it O
. O

The O
hardware O
is O
quite O
usable O
. O

I O
'm O
used O
to O
carrying O
a O
backpack O
- O
so O

I O
just O
received O
this O
item O
, O
and O
when O
I O
plugged O
it O
into O
my O
laptop O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
work O
. O

4"for O
about O
25 O
percent O

I O

I O
always O
keep O
it O

I O
have O

There O
was O
a O

A O
big O
bump O
in O

also O
noted O
when O

there O

, O
this O
may O
prove O
ideal O
, O
but O
I O
think O
I O
will O
return O
the O
device O
, O
and O
make O
do O
with O
a O
regular O

to O
plug O
one O
additional O
thing O
in O
every O
time O
( O
the O
HDMI O
port O
on O
my O

. O

Just O
needed O
to O
buy O
a O
cable O
to O
connect O
the O

the O

. O

The O
power O

is O
huge O

I O
have O
tried O
other O
brands O
of O
batteries O
but O
always O
come O
back O
to O
the O
Energizer O

I O
actually O
tested O

but O
I O
like O
having O
a O
mouse O

It O
also O
has O
a O
dedicated O
Tablet O
& O
Phone O

. O

As O
usual O
with O
any O
new O
computer O
you O
always O
want O
to O
get O
it O
updated O

the O

4 O
inch O
laptop O
... O
fits O
in O
perfectly O
, O
and O
has O
space O
for O
a O
few O
books O
/ O
notebooks O
as O
well O
.... O
good O
product O
, O
and O
awesome O
price O
too O
.... O

As O
many O
others O
have O
stated O
, O
I O
wanted O
a O
cordless O
headset O
to O
use O
with O
my O
iPhone O
4 O
since O
I O
am O
tired O
of O
having O
wired O
headsets O
yanked O
from O
my O
ears O
. O

The O
single O
USB O
1 O
. O

works O
but O
does O
n't O
cut O
it O
for O
big O
files O
. O

You O
really O
have O
to O
play O
around O
with O
the O
setting O
to O
get O
a O
good O
recording O
, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
just O
using O
it O
for O
normal O
conferencing O
I O
think O
you O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

Only O
issue O
remaining O
now O
is O
capacity O
after O
multiple O
cycles O
. O

It O
has O
a O
strong O
chemical O
smell O
. O

It O
is O
an O
ordinary O
micro O
usb O
cable O
, O
not O
much O
to O
say O
other O
than O
it O
works O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
ultrabook O
. O

and O
I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
impressed O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
for O
an O
all O
- O
in O
- O
one O
printer O

This O
laptop O
cooler O
pad O
is O
exactly O
like O
it O
was O
described O
. O

I O
got O
this O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
my O
girlfriend O

, O
but O
it O
started O
to O
come O
apart O
already O

the O
weight O
of O
my O

I O
have O
had O
these O
speakers O
since O
May O
2012 O
and O
they O
work O
great O
with O
the O
ipad O
, O
however O
when O
I O
try O
to O
use O
them O
with O
my O
MacBook O

The O
design O
of O
it O
prevents O
it O
from O
opening O
as O
wide O
as O
I O
'd O
like O
it O
when O
I O
'm O
holding O
it O
on O
my O

should O
I O
ever O
need O
it O
. O

This O
plug O
- O
n O
- O
play O
unit O
looks O
good O
and O
the O
price O
was O
not O
that O
bad O
. O

like O
the O
size O
of O
the O
fan O
. O

worth O
the O
value O
. O

The O
last O
thing O
you O
want O
to O
do O
is O
photograph O
a O
wedding O
and O
lose O
half O
of O
your O
shots O
. O

But O
this O
is O
a O
review O
for O
the O
laptop O
, O
not O
Windows O
8 O
! O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
needing O
more O
connections O
than O
are O
available O
here O
. O

Excellent O
price O
, O
this O
product O
is O
a O
winner O
! O

so O
we O
have O
a O
security O
friendly O
screening O
laptop O
area O
- O
but O
we O
have O
to O
yank O
out O
the O
iPad O
. O

This O
is O
happening O
time O
after O
time O
. O

When O
I O
ask O
them O
to O
play O
music O
, O
it O
is O
musical O
, O
full O
rich O
and O
satisfying O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
very O
well O
made O
. O

When O
I O
remove O
the O
adapter O
, O
I O
know O
it O
's O
impossible O
for O
my O
laptop O
to O
perform O
Bluetooth O
operations O
. O

I O
love O
this O
flash O
drive O
. O

This O
definitely O
helped O
out O
my O
situation O
. O

It O
fits O
my O
Envy O
14 O
like O
a O
glove O
and O
once O
I O
pick O
up O
a O
tablet O
, O
I O
really O
look O
forward O
to O
storing O
it O
in O
the O
faux O
- O
velvet O
lined O
dedicated O
tablet O
compartment O
on O
this O
backpack O
. O

To O
help O
me O
make O
evaluate O
and O
compare O
different O
speakers O
I O
always O
use O
the O
same O
pieces O
of O
music O
to O
test O
the O
speakers O
. O

Cable O
is O
exactly O
has O
pictured O
and O
works O
perfectly O
. O

BIG O
MISTAKE O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
for O
someone O
who O
wants O
a O
stylish O
laptop O
that O
is O
not O
branded O
by O
Apple O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
this O
is O
what O
you O
have O
to O
use O
to O
use O
the O
LightScribe O
technology O
( O
burning O
labels O
directly O
onto O
LightScribe O
discs O
) O
, O
because O
there O
is O
no O
printer O
driver O
to O
print O
to O
LightScribe O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
better O
fit O
, O
however O
I O
look O
at O
the O
unused O
space O
and O
see O
it O
as O
being O
wasted O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
small O
Ultrabook O
this O
laptop O
has O
some O
size O
and O
heft O
. O

The O
charge O
holds O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

This O
product O
fits O
the O
bill O
. O

but O
I O
was O
saving O
up O
for O
a O
MBA O
, O

The O
white O
glove O
delivery O
was O
outstanding O
... O
the O
guys O
who O
delivered O
it O
were O
quick O
, O
professional O
, O
and O
very O
knowledgeable O
. O

, O
after O
a O
months O
use O
I O
am O
in O
love O
with O
this O
very O
useful O
companion O
. O

With O
proper O
charging O
maintenance O
, O
I O
hope O
to O
get O
many O
years O
out O
this O
battery O
. O

If O
you O
could O
send O
me O
directions O
on O
how O
to O
set O
up O
the O
program O
for O
Windows O
7 O
ultimate O
, O
I O
would O
appreciate O
it O
. O

I O
tried O
changing O
the O
batteries O
but O
it O
would O
work O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
and O
then O
become O
unresponsive O
. O

at O
least O
5 O
minutes O
before O
it O
's O
usable O
after O
startup O
( O
and O
no O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
startup O
items O
and O
garbage O
starting O
on O
boot O
on O
either O
machine O
) O
. O

I O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
this O
SDHC O
card O
, O
high O
capacity O
, O
works O
well O
, O
good O
price O
, O
very O
fast O
and O
reliable O

What O
the O
IEraser O
is O
nice O
for O
is O
a O
computer O
screen O
, O
especially O
a O
large O
monitor O
. O

I O
use O
mine O
daily O
at O
my O

In O
short O
, O
it O

from O

this O

I O
tried O
another O

wow O
it O
is O
FAST O
now O
. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
solution O
. O

The O
only O
real O
problem O
that O
I O
had O
was O
that O
the O

I O
tried O
to O

flaws O
that O
came O
with O
it O
I O
would O
go O
ahead O
and O
put O
another O
20 O
$ O
to O
the O
already O
10 O
$ O
with O
this O
cable O
and O
get O
either O
an O
Apple O
or O
startech O
adapter O
. O

I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
send O
them O
back O
since O
they O
still O
worked O
. O

Skip O
this O

get O
something O
else O

Most O
users O
will O
not O
use O
more O

The O
noise O
level O
will O
vary O
between O
models O
and O
perhaps O
even O
between O
specific O
items.&#34;Makes O
no O
sense O
to O
me O
why O
you O
'd O
issue O
an O
RMA O
for O
a O
noise O
problem O
then O
refuse O
to O
replace O
it O
because O
they O
know O
it O
makes O
noise O
. O

so O
I O
'm O
used O
to O
dealing O
with O
faulty O

If O
you O
sit O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
meetings O
, O
and O
dislike O
taking O
detailed O
notes O
, O
this O
device O
will O
make O
you O
a O
lot O
more O
productive O
and O
a O
lot O
happier O
as O
well O
. O

I O
Ieave O
the O
keyboard O
on O
24x7 O
. O

if O
you O
want O
great O
sound O
then O
you O
are O
going O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
. O

I O
even O
placed O
the O
USB O
receiver O
right O
next O
to O
my O
Linksys O
wireless O
router O
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
cause O
any O
interference O
. O

I O
think O
that O
anything O
plugged O
into O
this O
amp O
sounds O
better O
. O

the O
machine O
getting O
so O
slow O
now O
and O
the O
hard O
drive O
is O
can O
not O
be O
upgraded O
. O

A O
little O
tricky O
and O
sticky O
business O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
waiting O
for O
my O
refund O
on O
the O
laptop O
as O
well O
. O

Shipment O
and O
packing O
were O
all O
acceptable O
. O

I O
got O
this O
for O
my O
ipad O
mini O
in O
order O
to O
take O
notes O
in O
class O
instead O
of O
lugging O
around O
my O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
. O

charging O
is O
normal O
- O
about O
2 O
- O
3 O
hrs O
( O
and O
it O
will O
play O
while O
charging O
) O
. O

But- O
for O
30 O
bux O
plus O
shipping O
, O
from O
Electronics O
Expo O
, O
Boston O
Acoustic O
MM O
220 O
's O
broke O
the O
needle O
on O
the O
Awesomeness O
scale O
. O

Even O
when O
the O
speaker O
worked O
with O
a O
single O
cable O
, O
I O
rarely O
bothered O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
just O
one O
, O
I O
bought O
4 O
and O
know O
I O
could O
use O
more O
. O

i O
would O
suggest O
to O
buy O
a O
warranty O
with O
it O
, O
just O
in O
case O
. O

Just O
check O
out O
all O
the O
positive O
reviews O
for O
this O
one O
. O

I O
'm O
torn O
on O
a O
recommendation O
either O
way O
. O

If O
you O
just O
want O
to O
use O
this O
drive O
on O
your O
home O
network O
, O
you O
can O
do O
that O
with O
Windows O
' O
built O
- O
in O
networking O
capability O
. O

At O
best O
we O
usually O
have O
to O
manipulate O
our O
laptop O
to O
just O
the O
right O
position O
to O
find O
a O
sporadic O
at O
best O
connection O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
got O
this O
case O
over O
one O
of O
the O
soft O
side O
cases O
. O

once O
he O
learns O
to O
integrate O
the O
keyboard O
and O
touchscreen O
, O
I O
think O
he O
'll O
love O
it O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
BIOS O
settings O
and O
switch O
the O
OS O
setting O
to O
" O
Legacy O
" O
, O
so O
that O
Windows O
7 O
would O
read O
. O

LCD O
HDTVand O
decided O
to O
go O
with O
the O
Samsung O
because O
it O
was O
cheaper O
and O
offered O
similar O
features O
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
laptop O
cooler O
for O
cheap O
, O
that O
will O
severely O
cool O
your O
laptop O
down O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
Cooler O
Master O
X O
Pad O
Slim O
. O

Anyone O
can O
adjust O
to O
this O
skin O
cover O
in O
less O
than O
a O
day O
. O

But O
as O
someone O
else O
who O
had O
both O
the O
11 O
and O
13 O
said O
, O
they O
found O
that O
they O
took O
the O
11 O
" O
with O
them O
more O
often O
than O
they O
took O
the O
13 O
" O
, O
so O
even O
small O
differences O
in O
weight O
matter O
. O

Just O
Corel O
Sketch O
Pad O
costs O
$ O
120 O
and O
Photoshop O
Elements O
7 O
costs O
$ O
70 O
+ O
if O
I O
were O
to O
buy O
it O
as O
a O
standalone O

It O
's O
fast O
enough O
to O
play O
games O
like O

I O
am O
a O
college O
student O
, O
and O
at O
home O
my O
parents O
have O
a O
Windows O
desktop O
. O

This O
carrying O
bag O
is O
a O
very O
well O
made O
bag O
. O

There O
's O
an O
elegant O
looking O
capsule O
shaped O
zippered O
side O
pocket O
accentuated O
by O
a O
gray O
embroidered O
surround O
and O
similarly O
shaped O
green O
zip O
pull O
. O

Every O
time O
he O
comes O
to O
visit O
, O
he O
has O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
10 O
minutes O
searching O
the O
house O
looking O
for O
his O
car O
keys O
. O

Works O
like O
a O
charm O
, O
it O
is O
of O
durable O
material O
which O
makes O
me O
very O
happy O
. O

Great O
instructions O
. O

I O
've O
never O
tried O
one O
before O
, O
but O
I O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
seem O
to O
like O
them O
. O

I O
have O
also O
used O
it O
to O
tote O
tools O
, O
flashlights O
, O
and O
supplies O
when O
I O
was O
running O
cables O
in O
the O
attic O
. O

I O
remove O
the O
power O
supply O
( O
now O
on O
battery O
) O
and O
the O
computer O
does O
n't O
even O
blink O
when O
I O
hit O
the O
power O
button O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I O
use O
the O
included O
shoulder O
strap O
90 O
% O
of O
the O
time O
. O

I O
think O
it O
works O
quite O
well O
, O
although O
I O
wish O
the O
battery O
would O
stay O
charged O
longer O
. O

and O
I O
have O
to O
constantly O
worry O
about O
what O
I O
'm O
watching O
. O

so O
I O
ordered O
3 O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
. O

Another O
company O
repaired O
it O
by O
flashing O
the O
bios O
. O

only O
con O
i O
have O
is O
that O
the O
smart O
gesture O
center O
sometimes O
does O
nt O
work O
when O
you O
close O
the O
laptop O
and O
reopen O
it O
so O
you O
ca O
nt O
scroll O
with O
the O
touchpad O
, O
but O
when O
you O
restart O
it O
, O
it O
works O
again O
! O

( O
And O
the O
design O
and O
the O
angle O
of O
the O
top O
of O
the O
main O
compartment O
actually O
make O
it O
even O
more O
difficult O
than O
it O
should O
be!)Since O
my O
lapop O

So O
far O
working O
okay O
to O
me O
.. O

I O
have O
bags O
under O
my O
eyes O

I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
local O
Apple O
store O
and O
get O
them O
both O
serviced O
. O

Would O
definitely O
buy O
another O
if O
the O
need O
arose O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O

However O
it O
is O
within O
acceptable O
limits O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
overall O
a O
good O
value O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
extend O
the O
life O
of O
your O
old O
Macbook O
without O
breaking O
the O
bank O
. O

Even O
though O
my O
desktop O
which O
uses O
this O
wireless O
adapter O
is O
across O
the O
house O
from O
FIOS O
' O
802 O
. O

Even O
if O
they O
were O
the O
same O
price O
, O
I O
would O
have O
bought O
them O
in O
place O
of O
the O
ER6-I O
's O
. O

Fast O
Ship O
just O
as O
described O
. O

Picked O
it O
up O
during O
the O
BF O
sales O
and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
2 O
for O
10 O
bucks O
each O
. O

it O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
how O
to O
plug O
it O
on O
i O
use O
it O
for O
a O
Ad255e O
Acer O
Aspire O
one O
it O
works O
! O

Well O
, O
bad O
news O
: O
it O
failed O
! O

Product O
was O
so O
smooth O
to O
the O
touch O
, O
looks O
well O
- O
made O
( O
will O
update O
if O
begin O
to O
see O
any O
wear O
and O
tear O
) O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
professional O
. O

It O
looks O
and O
feels O
exactly O
like O
the O
original O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
primarily O
due O
to O
its O
thin O
profile O
and O
Blackberry O
" O
Pearl"-like O
roller O
ball O
, O
hoping O
it O
would O
fit O
more O
easily O
in O
my O
notebook O
PC O
's O
carrying O
sleeve O
than O
a O
traditional O
mouse O
, O
and O
work O
well O
as O
both O
a O
mouse O
and O
a O
trackball O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
ever O
bought O
it O
is O
so O
handy O
to O
use O
a O
backpack O
and O
not O
a O
bag O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
someone O
who O
is O
a O
night O
owl O
like O
me O

Having O
bought O
into O
the O
Sandisk O
hype O
for O
years O
, O
I O
decided O
the O
substantially O
lower O
cost O
of O
the O
Transcend O
made O
it O
worth O
a O
try O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
like O
about O
APC O
batteries O
is O
that O
you O
can O
print O
postage O
return O
labels O
from O
APC O
to O
send O
the O
battery O
back O
for O
recycling O
. O

Love O
the O
slide O
off O

design O
. O

Someone O
posted O
a O
fix O
for O
the O
Linux O
version O
, O
I O
have O
not O
found O
an O

fix O
yet O

The O

. O

I O
have O

I O
want O
to O
check O
this O
out O
vs. O
Windows O
Office O
. O

* O
other O
uses O
for O
this O
laptop O
are O
only O
limited O
by O
screen O
size O
. O

Tried O
a O
few O
other O
distros O
and O
a O
few O
bridge O
setups O

But O
overall O
great O
machine O
. O

I O
've O
red O
poor O
reviews O
on O
this O
battery O
so O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
it O
does O
over O
time O
, O
but O
so O
far O
so O
good O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
price O
! O

C. O
U. O
K. O
was O
great O
though O
. O

The O
laptop O
fits O
well O
, O
and O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
room O
in O
the O
outside O
pouch O
for O
the O
power O
brick O
and O
cord O
and O
a O
mouse O
. O

The O
battery O

never O
goes O
above O
85 O
% O
even O
though O
I O
have O
" O
conditioned O
" O
it O
to O
the O
laptop O
. O

The O
cable O
that O
came O
with O
my O
WD O
MyBook O
has O
a O
solid O
metal O
connection O
and O
mounts O
firmly O
in O
the O

Slot O
. O

One O
end O
looked O
a O
little O
bent O
from O
plastic O
molding O
to O
metal O
end O
. O

As O
some O
have O
said O
, O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
this O
netbook O
to O
have O
come O
with O
2Gs O
of O
ram O
rather O
than O
1G. O

It O
has O
no O
& O
# O
34;brand O
name&#34 O

to O
drawn O
attention O
to O
it O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
the O
need O
to O
use O
the O
mouse O
further O
than O
a O
few O
feet O
from O
the O
receiver O
either O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
becuase O
I O
foolishly O
broke O
the O
display O
port O
adapter O
that O
I O
had O
with O
my O
Del O
Optiplex O
computer O
. O

A O
really O
easy O
way O
to O
double O
the O
memory O
on O
my O
flash O
camcorder O
. O

Received O
a O
defective O
unit O
. O

, O
the O
screen O
is O
very O
nice O
( O
small O
of O
course O
) O
. O

Comes O
with O
zero O
permanent O
cords O
. O

but O
the O
fan O
is O
loud O
... O

You O
can O
get O
other O
units O
for O
a O
third O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Loved O
it O
so O
much O
and O
still O
has O
it O
after O
8 O
years O
.. O

I O
then O
need O
it O
plugged O
in O

That O
's O
why O
it O
was O
delayed O
while O
they O
tried O
to O
remedy O
the O
weak O
WIFI O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
gave O
it O
4 O
stars O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
again O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
for O
everybody O
considering O
the O
additional O
care O
that O
the O
( O
* O
real O
* O
) O
leather O
warrants O
and O
the O
additional O
weight O

as O
well O
as O
the O
aesthetic O
design O
. O

Professional O
packaging O
, O
quick O
delivery O
, O
and O
performance O
as O
expected O
. O

I O
love O
this O
bag O
. O

If O
you O
are O
on O
the O
fence O
of O
purchasing O
a O
laptop O
, O
and O
comparing O
this O
to O
something O
else O
I O
would O
suggest O
this O
one O
. O

To O
protect O
my O
screen O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
use O
anything O
else O
. O

Half O

Right O
off O
the O

the O

on O
the O

incredible O

It O
holds O
up O
to O
everything O
I O
throw O
at O
it O
and O
then O
asks O
for O
more O
! O

Case O
in O
point O
, O
it O
would O
not O
reveice O
any O
of O
the O
weaker O
stations O
, O
but O
the O
telescopic O
antenna O
brought O
them O
in O
clearly O
. O

The O
Aerb O
keyboard O
worked O
okay O
, O
including O
the O
touch O
pad O
and O
mouse O
keys O
, O
but O
using O
it O
was O
awkward O
for O
me O
, O
due O
largely O
to O
its O
small O
size O
( O
about O
6&#34 O
; O

The O
fabric O
has O
stretched O
slightly O
in O
general O
since O
I O
purchased O
it O
but O
it O
has O
only O
made O
my O
netbook O
fit O
better O
and O
seems O
to O
have O
stopped O
. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
with O
shipping O
which O
was O
fast O
, O
but O
the O
product O
was O
missing O
something O
. O

This O
is O
the O
place O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

It O
was O
recognized O
but O
extremely O
slow O
. O

It O
is O
very O
rare O
they O
may O
not O
have O
them O

They O
have O
a O

The O

I O
wanted O
it O
to O

That O

I O
took O
it O
home O

it O

the O
battery O
was O
not O
taking O

after O
all O

it O

just O

sure O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
reasonably O
priced O
bag O
for O
a O
netbook O
( O
up O
to O
13 O
" O
) O
, O
you O
should O
seriously O
consider O
this O
one O
. O

It O
fits O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
perfectly O
and O
protects O
the O
aluminum O
case O
of O
the O
machine O
from O
nicks O
and O
scrapes O
. O

And O
it O
will O
happen O
at O
the O
worst O
possible O
time O
, O
when O
your O
most O
cherished O
music O
and O
photos O
are O
lost O
. O

- O
It O
came O
with O
Windows O

which O
is O
an O
abomination O
on O
a O
non O
touchscreen O
device O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
sucks O
on O
any O
device O
. O

It O
states O
that O
this O
charger O
fits O
the O
L6500 O
series O
. O

Just O
improving O
the O
brief O
manual O
would O
go O
a O
long O
way O
to O
bumping O
this O
up O
to O
a O
five O
star O
review O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sophisticated O
, O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
computers O
, O
but O
this O
keyboard O
is O
so O
intuitive O
, O
it O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Then O
the O

and O
I O
was O
not O
happy O
with O
the O
small O
screen O
real O
estate O
as O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
hurt O
my O
vision O
with O
small O

The O
slightly O
ribbed O

is O
very O

friendly O

there O

a O
dedicated O

Not O
to O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
for O
their O
mac O
or O
apple O
device O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
backpack O
. O

I O
like O
that O
the O
ports O
on O
this O
hub O
are O
well O
spaced O
out O
. O

With O
the O
extension O
the O
reach O
is O
approx O
3 O
feet O
! O

With O
a O
messenger O
bag O
, O
I O
just O
swivel O
it O
around O
to O
the O
front O
; O
much O
easier O
and O
safer O
. O

For O
setup O
, O
just O
plug O
it O
in O
. O

I O
travel O
a O
lot O
for O
work O
, O
and O
this O
bad O
has O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
clothes O
and O
laptop O
, O
will O
all O
the O
power O
cords O
. O

Other O
reviewers O
rated O
the O

8 O
GB O
pack O
as O
a O
better O
alternative O
but O
the O
specs O
only O
list O
MAC O
as O
the O
platform O

Given O
the O
price O
I O
would O
have O
been O
okay O
with O
that O
. O

Does O
what O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
do O
and O
that O
is O
to O
protect O
my O
Tablet O
. O

Is O
very O
smooth O
and O
thin O
... O

Get O
the O
largest O
size O
you O
can O
afford O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
're O
not O
diligent O
about O
removing O
content O
from O
your O
camera.- O

Continuous O
mode O
for O
taking O
photos O
is O
very O
fast O
( O
though O
the O
shutter O
lag O
is O
n't O
nearly O
as O
good O
as O
DSLR O
cameras O
) O
13 O
. O

The O
price O
is O
great O
. O

It O
would O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
one O
, O
so O
no O
reason O
to O
repeat O
. O

This O
little O
disc O
surprised O
me O
. O

It O
bright O
enough O
to O
be O
annoying O
at O
night O
, O
but O
too O
small O
and O
harsh O
to O
be O
useful O
as O
a O
night O
light O
. O

And O
even O
though O
it O
's O
huge O
, O
I O
can O
adjust O
the O
screen O
so O
that O
I O
can O
reasonably O
, O
if O
a O
bit O
uncomfortably O
, O
use O
it O
to O
get O
work O
done O
in O
coach O
on O
AirTran O
( O
which O
is O
really O
, O
really O
tight).The O
absolute O
best O
part O
is O
the O
battery O
. O

I O
would O
buy O
another O
cable O
from O
this O
company O
! O

The O
Samsung O
has O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
believing O
this O
would O
fit O
most O
17inch O
screen O
laptops O
, O
but O
it O
works O
great O
for O
what O
I O
ordered O
it O
for O
. O

Original O
( O
Sep O
7 O
, O
2014):Really O
like O
this O
speaker O
, O
it O
has O
good O
quality O
sound O
for O
being O
so O
small O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

But O
1 O
star O
off O
: O
I O
bought O
this O
for O
a O
Lenovo O
S210 O
11 O
. O

so O
I O
left O
it O
on O
the O
pc O
as O
an O
extra O
drive O
. O

( O
USB O
2 O
is O
capable O
of O
480Mbps O
that O
is O
shared O
with O
all O
of O
your O
USB O
devices O
) O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
this O
problem O
with O
my O
Logitech O
mouse O
. O

What O
they O
should O
have O
disclosed O
is O
that O
your O
ipad O
will O
get O
wet O
and O
you O
could O
run O
the O
danger O
of O
shorting O
out O
the O
electronics O
if O
water O
gets O
into O
the O
speakers O
or O
the O
holes O
surrounding O
the O
buttons O
. O

While O
the O
setup O
works O
as O
designed O
, O
the O
pocket O
is O
perhaps O
wider O
than O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
. O

The O
quality O
is O
great O
and O
for O
$ O
416 O
bucks O

This O
bag O
is O
fine O
for O
the O
XT O
and O
some O
smaller O
lenses O

I O
recommend O
buying O
this O
machine O
directly O
from O
Amazon O
, O
and O
to O
use O
it O
thoroughly O
in O
the O
first O
month O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
there O
are O
no O
problems O
. O

I O
used O
it O
on O
Windows O
7 O
application O
. O

The O
one O
draw O
back O
is O
although O
the O
two O
speakers O
fit O
nicely O
anywhere O
, O
the O
sub O
- O
woofer O
is O
larger O
and O
requires O
more O
room O
than O
my O
desk O
can O
accommodate O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
ship O
you O
a O
Displayport O
to O
VGA O
cable O
. O

Have O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
what O
so O
ever O
thus O
far O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
you O
wo O
n't O
even O
notice O
that O
it O
's O
there O

I O
am O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
the O
quality O
in O
manufacturing O
went O
down O
on O
this O
product O
. O

Even O
with O
its O
thin O
dimensions O
, O
my O
Ultrabook O
fastened O
securely O
leaving O
me O
without O
worries O
of O
it O
bouncing O
around O
when O
being O
transported O
. O

The O
Kata O
3N1 O
- O
35 O
is O
still O
not O
perfect O
( O
could O
use O
a O
few O
more O
pockets O
for O
small O
items O
) O
, O
but O
its O
the O
best O
backpack O
I O
've O
owned O
so O
far O
. O

I&#8217;ve O
seen O
people O
complaining O
about O
the O
touch O
pad O
, O
but O
I O
can&#8217;t O
say O
I O
have O
. O

But O
once O
you O
give O
it O
the O
power O
it O
needs O
, O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

Video O
quality O
is O
- O
amazingly O
- O
rather O
bad O
: O
the O
colors O
are O
off O

At O
the O
title O
says O
my O
pro O
( O
which O
I O
had O
running O
wonderfully O
with O
Windows O
7 O
as O
primary O
OS O
as O
OSX O
was O
way O
to O
limited O
) O
fell O
off O
my O
bed O
( O
the O
cat O
rubbed O
against O
it O
and O
pushed O
it O
off O
) O
and O
it O
landed O
on O
the O
carpet O
. O

I O
installed O
it O
without O
loading O
the O
CD O
in O
about O
3 O
minutes O
. O

I O
saw O
this O
hybrid O
drive O
and O
thought O
maybe O
I O
could O
get O
the O
benifit O
of O
a O
SSD O
plus O
the O
storage O
capacity O
of O
a O
standard O
drive O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
'd O
be O
putting O
the O
dock O
on O
a O
bookshelf O
or O
on O
a O
desk O
, O
but O
no O
, O
I O
had O
to O
find O
somewhere O
attractive O
to O
place O
it O
( O
it O
's O
on O
top O
the O
piano O
) O
. O

Two O
off O
the O
screen O
cushions O
fell O
of O
early O
on O
, O
before O
any O
drop O
. O

UPDATE O
12/22/2009:One O
other O
thing O
which O
is O
n't O
the O
fault O
of O
Samsung O
but O
might O
help O
you O
determine O
if O
this O
is O
the O
TV O
for O
you O
. O

There O
are O
few O
sharp O
edges O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
would O
expect O
that O
at O
all O
. O

Saturday O
, O
March O
9 O
, O
2013 O
: O
The O
vendor O
sent O
me O
an O
e O
- O
mail O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
keyboard O
and O
to O
offer O
their O
help O
with O
any O
problems O
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
that O
this O
system O
was O
just O
going O
to O
be O
loud O
and O
very O
heavily O
waited O
to O
reproducing O
low O
end O
frequencies O
. O

So O
only O
the O
four O
ports O
on O
the O
base O
are O
particularly O
useful O
. O

Even O
at O
higher O
volume O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
hear O
the O
true O
sounds O
as O
the O
producer O
made O
them O
. O

After O
owning O
and O
trying O
out O
several O
large O
USB O
hubs O
over O
the O
years O
, O
I O
suppose O
I O
just O
expected O
to O
see O
a O
small O
brick O
when O
I O
opened O
the O
box O
. O

They O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
x220 O
is O
equally O
appealing O
to O
consumers O
looking O
for O
a O
machine O
capable O
of O
handling O
the O
most O
intensive O
creative O
tasks O
, O
like O
video O
editing O
, O

, O

has O
a O
clasp O
that O
holds O
the O
iPad O
securely O
and O
wo O
n't O
let O
it O
fall O

. O

I O
ordered O
my O
Acer O
Aspire O
One O
10 O
. O

/returned O
- O
for O
a O
super O
bargain O
on O
this O
item O
. O

I O
can O
recommend O
this O
model O
just O
watch O
out O
for O
weird O
motherboard O
issues O
. O

I O
plugged O
it O
in O
, O
installed O
the O
software O
, O
plugged O
in O
the O
network O
wire O
and O
was O
surfing O
at O
1 O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
most O
AC O
inverters O
are O
going O
to O
use O
up O
to O
12 O
. O

What O
is O
so O
nice O
about O
is O
that O
the O
reciever O
which O
plugs O
into O
the O
USB O
port O
is O
small O
enough O
that O
it O
can O
be O
left O
in O
without O
to O
much O
fear O
of O
damage O
when O
when O
moving O
the O
computer O
around O
. O

It O
works O
well O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
devices O
, O
that O
's O
probably O

Arrived O
in O
good O
shape O
, O
looks O
functional O
, O
and O
fits O
inside O
my O
Pelican O
case O
for O
emergency O
use O
. O

Small O

When O
I O
start O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O

and O
get O
started O

The O
technical O

are O
available O
for O
all O
to O
read O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
for O
me O
to O
repeat O
them O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
think O
the O
bigger O
you O
go O
, O
the O
more O
awkward O
it O
may O
become O
. O

Summery O

that O
I O
have O

with O
it O

All O
the O

my O

The O
cable O
is O
heavy O
duty O

obviously O
well O
made O

It O
has O
yet O
to O
drop O
a O

like O
i O
had O
with O
other O
similar O
items O
before O
. O

( O
I O
am O
SO O
glad O
I O
had O
the O
prescience O
to O
realize O
a O
year O

that O
I O
definitely O
wanted O
to O
shift O
to O
a O

, O
a O
word O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
monitor O
. O

The O
drive O
is O
1/2 O
inch O
thick O
and O
runs O
right O
off O

from O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
the O
only O
real O
thing O
that O
annoys O
me O
, O
and O
its O
more O
of O
a O
" O
why O
do O
that O
when O
you O
can O
just O
do O
this O
" O
thing O
. O

After O
a O
week O
, O
the O
battery O
began O
to O
fail O
. O

My O
laptop O
only O
has O
2 O
ports O
. O

I O
've O
had O
other O
Griffin O
products O
before O

I O
noticed O
the O
mic O
picks O
up O
better O
if O
you O
remove O
the O
fuzzball O
/ O
muffler O
thing O
. O

The O
tabs O
that O
hold O
it O
on O
are O
small O
and O
wear O
out O
. O

Battery O
life O
is O
poor O
, O
so O
this O
computer O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
much O
better O
and O
suited O
for O
those O
who O
have O
access O
to O
a O
wall O
outlet O
. O

If O
you O
have O
complicated O
applications O
which O
require O
certain O
windows O
settings O
untouched O
, O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
that O
you O
inform O
the O
support O
team O
upfront O
so O
they O
do O
not O
perform O
upgrades O
/ O
changes O
in O
those O
areas O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
buying O
this O
laptop O
for O
99 O
$ O
in O
a O
group O
on O
sale O
and O
I O
would O
consider O
it O
a O
hundred O
well O
spent O
. O

This O
battery O
fit O
perfectly O
and O
performs O
just O
like O
the O
OEM O
battery O
. O

I O
was O
so O
happy O
to O
find O
one O
for O
the O
latest O
generation O
. O

I O
've O
used O
this O
drive O
for O
a O
week O
and O
I O
am O
very O
satisified O
with O
its O
performace O
so O
far O
. O

Shipping O
was O
a O
bit O
high O
( O
$ O
8 O
+ O
) O
, O
but O
was O
fairly O
quick O
once O
it O
got O
shipped O
. O

I O
added O
16 O
GB O
ram O
and O
a O
7200 O
WD O
Scorpio O
Hdd O
and O
its O
a O
devouring O
monster O
for O
less O
than O
a O
thousand O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
an O
external O
drive O
dock O
for O
hot O
- O
swapping O
and O
easy O
management O
of O
bare O
drives O
rather O
than O
piles O
of O
external O
drives O
, O
cables O
and O
enclosures O
seems O
nothing O
short O
of O
brilliant O
to O
me O
. O

I O
had O
to O
give O
permission O
for O
" O
other O
computer O
" O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
Internet O
network O
connection O
with O
the O
code O
even O
though O
I O
was O
on O
the O
same O
computer O
on O
the O
same O
Internet O
connection O
, O
but O
just O
via O
WiFi O
. O

I O
also O
reinstalled O
Windows O
but O
no O
change O
. O

The O
Docking O
Station O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
power O
indicator O
, O
and O
it O
makes O
the O
device O
look O
very O
slick O
. O

+ O
Spotify O
frontend O
, O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
TV O
and O
audio O
system O
. O

For O
such O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
equipment O
it O
truly O
puts O
out O
a O
decent O
quality O
sound O
and O
can O
get O
quite O
loud O
. O

Those O
were O
pretty O
good O
machines O
but O
without O
advanced O
off O
board O
gaming O
GPU O
's O
you O
ca O
n't O
play O
any O
really O
good O
games O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
possible O
to O
have O
good O
quality O
low O
light O
filming O
on O
a O
consumer O
level O
camcorder O
. O

I O
said O
CYA O
! O

Its O
great O
waking O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
find O
my O
computer O
cool O
and O
work O
complete O
without O
shutting O
down O
. O

The O
use O
of O
the O
printer O
port O
has O
been O
convenient O
. O

When O
I O
'd O
push O
the O
windows O
button O
I O
could O
feel O
a O
slight O
vibrate O

I O
know O
this O
product O
got O
high O
ratings O
, O
but O
either O
Amazon O
is O
full O
of O
counterfeit O
products O
or O
I O
always O
get O
a O
lemon O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
small O
and O
easy O
to O
carry O
around O
but O
falls O
short O
of O
the O
quality O
I O
've O
come O
to O
expect O
from O
Canon O
products O
. O

Product O
was O
just O
as O
described O
. O

This O
means O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
damaging O
the O
hard O
drive O
if O
the O
computer O
is O
dropped O
. O

Excellent O
light O
output O
and O
small O
enough O
to O
carry O
in O
laptop O
bag O
. O

So O
far O
all O
seems O
ok O
will O
let O
you O
know O
after O
my O
next O
tour.*****UP O

I O
have O
now O
used O
this O
little O
guy O
over O
a O
year O
and O
have O
up O
graded O
memory O
to O
2gig O
and O
up O
graded O
to O
Windows O
7 O
Home O
Premium O

I O
m O
pretty O
tech O
savy O
and O
could O
not O
get O
it O
to O
install O
. O

I O
really O
love O
it O
and O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
in O
the O
market O
. O

1/2013 O
: O
The O
manufacturer O
did O
honor O
the O
warranty O
and O
replace O
my O
battery O
, O
though O
it O
took O
some O
doing O
to O
contact O
them O
and O
arrange O
it O
all O
. O

Plastic O
lenses O
are O
cheap O
and O
light O
for O
a O
reason O
. O

wow O
, O
big O
! O

I O
read O
thru O
all O
the O
reviews O
before O
clicking O
buy O
. O

To O
replace O
the O
battery O
or O
upgrade O
memory O
it O
looks O
like O
about O
16 O
screws O
need O
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
case O
. O

These O
have O
worked O
great O
. O

So O
all O
of O
you O
that O
had O
it O
fail O
before O
that O
one O
year O
mark O
, O
call O
Dell O
and O
get O
a O
new O
one O
. O

Brought O
an O
old O
Powerbook O
back O
to O
usefulness O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
cable O
for O
anyone O
who O
needs O
to O
transfer O
data O
from O
their O
phone O
to O
their O
computer O
and O
vise O
- O
versa O
. O

So O
needless O
to O
say O
.... O

I O
think O
Nokia O
has O
it O
right O
in O
no O
tmaking O
it O
a O
phone O
too O
( O
and O
locked O
down O
) O
. O

I O
use O
it O
on O
my O
gaming O
setup O
. O

Bright O

My O
mistake O
( O
in O
retrospect O
) O
was O
buying O
HP O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

I O
was O
willing O
to O
take O
the O
risk O
despite O
all O
those O
negative O
reviews O
, O
because O
of O
the O
full O
version O
windows O
. O

( O
Why O
would O
anyone O
buy O
an O
i3 O
is O
beyond O
me O
) O
. O

I O
used O
my O
iPhone O
wall O
charger O
because O
it O
's O
also O
5v O
, O
and O
it O
worked O
great O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
have O
purchased O
to O
date O
. O

It O
's O
basically O
a O
neoprene O
bag O
, O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
do O
n't O
buy O
one O
that O
's O
too O
big O
for O
your O
computer O
or O
tablet O
or O
it O
will O
flop O
around O
. O

If O
you O
want O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
the O
graphics O
run O
, O
it O
can O
run O
WoW O
at O
good O
graphics O
at O
around O
25 O
fps O
. O

The O
Inspiron O
15R O
has O
a O
total O
of O
4 O
USB O
ports O
( O
two O
USB O
2 O
. O
0 O
, O
and O
two O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
) O
. O

I O
have O
been O
truly O
amazed O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
video O
that O
this O
thing O
puts O
out O
! O

But O
I O
have O
a O
laptop O
and O
an O
iPad O
and O
the O
battery O
lasts O
for O
10 O
hours O
in O
the O
latter O
, O
4 O
hours O
in O
the O
former O
. O

Now O
this O
is O
n't O
about O
the O
Air O
or O
Lion O
, O
but O
the O
comments O
above O
relate O
to O
how O
I O
( O
and O
why O
I O
do O
n't O
much O
) O
use O
my O
Chromebook O
. O

Not O
deal O
- O
breaking O
for O
me O
, O
but O
some O
people O
may O
find O
this O
annoying O
. O

( O
well O
I O
got O
mine O
on O
sale O
during O
the O
Staples O
deal O
of O
$ O
349).Build O
quality O
is O
good O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
some O
of O
the O
ASUS O
routers O
are O
a O
good O
value O
and O
highly O
customizable O
. O

For O
that O
price O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
! O

Both O
installed O
easily O
and O
other O
Bluetooth O
source O
devices O
talk O
to O
them O
as O
advertised O
by O
the O
seller O
. O

This O
card O
is O
( O
was O
) O
used O
in O
a O
Linux O
based O
home O
router O
/ O
server O
. O

I O
got O
it O
to O
bike O
to O
/ O
from O
work O
and O
have O
my O
work O
laptop O
in O
a O
padded O
case O
, O
and O
for O
that O
it O
fits O
the O
bill O
. O

75 O
megabytes O
per O
second O
) O
, O
and O
I O
never O
get O
any O
downloads O
faster O
than O
like O
2 O
megabytes O
per O
second O
anyway O
. O

Most O
people O
do O
the O
same O
with O
their O
music O

The O
only O
drawback O
I O
could O
find O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
easy O
way O
to O
store O
the O
battery O
cord O
and O
line O
cord O
with O
the O
unit O
. O

So O
many O
compartments O
on O
this O
bag O
, O
including O
2 O
on O
the O
flap O
. O

If O
not O
, O
I O
wo O
nt O
get O
another O
. O

Download O
and O
install O
the O
latest O
version O
of O
iTunes O
. O

up.- O
Flexible O
with O
OS O
. O

This O
was O
the O
best O
choice O
for O
my O
family O
room O
environment O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
some O
lenovo O
/ O
mac O
screens O
that O
put O
this O
screen O
to O
shame O
. O

This O
backpack O
is O
just O
awesome O
so O
big O
, O
fancy O
, O
tough O
, O
beautiful O
and O
very O
good O
design O
, O
for O
the O
price O
that O
I O
pay O
for O
this O
, O
it O
really O
worth O
it O
at O
100 O
% O
. O

Given O
how O
tiny O
the O
LCD O
screen O
is O
, O
I O
'm O
somewhat O
surprised O
Logitech O
could O
n't O
have O
gotten O
the O
screen O
to O
work O
with O
USB O
power O
. O

But O
they O
gave O
me O
instructions O
on O
how O
to O
use O
their O
included O
utility O
to O
back O
up O
my O
user O
data O
to O
an O
SD O
card O
before O
sending O
the O
tablet O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

Good O
product O
for O
a O
great O
price O
. O

Solid O
case O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
this O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
misuse O
, O
as O
it O
is O
only O
used O
for O
word O
processing O
, O
no O
internet O
downloads O
. O

This O
unit O
is O
a O
really O
nice O
blend O
of O
low O
price O
without O
sacrificing O
quality O
. O

I O
mention O
this O
because O
I O
've O
accidentally O
left O
it O
on O
a O
few O
times O
by O
not O
holding O
the O
button O
in O
long O
enough O
- O
but O
it O
's O
never O
been O
a O
problem O
. O

It O
fits O
in O
my O
2011 O
MacBook O
Pro O
but O
there O
was O
a O
little O
free O
space O
left O
. O

you O
can O
zoom O
in O
and O
out O
, O
rotate O
your O
photos O
, O
whatever O
! O

This O
mouse O
cost O
$ O
5 O
with O
free O
shipping O
. O

So O
far O
I O
've O
had O
2 O
. O
5 O
hour O
cycles O
, O
so O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
OK O
. O

By O
far O
the O
lightest O
PC O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
carry O
around O
, O
though O
it O
might O
be O
more O
of O
a O
challenge O
finding O
a O
case O
to O
your O
liking O
that O
fits O
it O
. O

Terribly O
bummed O
about O
this O
purchase O
. O

2nd O
UPDATE O
: O
I O
recently O
found O
two O
reviews O
, O
one O
for O
this O
model O
and O
one O
for O
the O
RM650 O
, O
in O
which O
the O
reviewers O
tested O
the O
cables O
and O
take O
the O
cover O
off O
( O
which O
I O
wo O
n't O
do O
as O
it O
voids O
the O
warranty O
) O
and O
both O
found O
problems O
with O
less O
- O
than O
- O
great O
capacitor O
choices O
and O
in O
one O
case O
broken O
wires O
to O
the O
motherboard O
. O

These O
guys O
are O
rock O
solid O
and O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
making O
any O
major O
purchase O
without O
them O
. O

THis O
bag O
accomplishes O
both O
and O
then O
some O
. O

The O
keys O
have O
some O
space O
between O
them O
and O
they O
are O
raised O
- O
think O
Scrabble O
pieces O
laying O
on O
a O
table O
. O

So O
no O
drivers O
are O
needed O
for O
Windows O
XP O
. O

Got O
sick O
of O
replacing O
batteries O
. O

but O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
to O
trust O
a O
teenager O
. O

The O
keyboard O
has O
dedicated O
multimedia O
buttons O
on O
the O
top O
. O

After O
a O
bit O
of O
use O
with O
Windows O
I O
decided O
to O
format O
the O
drive O
to O
make O
a O
triple O
boot O
and O
install O
Mac O
OS O
X O
Lion O
, O
Windows O
7 O
, O
and O
Ubuntu O
on O
the O
same O
drive O
, O
and O
to O
my O
surprise O
it O
works O
quite O
well O
without O
having O
to O
do O
much O
to O
it O
. O

slight O
upward O
pressure O
. O

I O
am O
using O
it O
for O
business O
travel O
significantly O
and O
it O
easily O
accommodates O
everything O
I O
need O
, O
including O
my O
large O
Dell O

they O
said O
it O
was O
plug O
- O
n O
- O
play O
. O

N O
it O
is O
much O
faster O
. O

The O
great O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
it O
added O
another O
USB O
port O
to O
my O
laptop O
in O
an O
ExpressCard O
slot O
that O
was O
n't O
doing O
anything O
before O
but O
holding O
a O
blank O
piece O
of O
plastic O
. O

Thanks O
for O
this O
product O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
a O
little O
over O
a O
month O
ago O
from O
Amazon O
. O

I O
assume O
it O
is O
an O
OEM O
part O
. O

this O
may O
be O
because O
the O
vents O
are O
on O
the O
bottom O
which O
is O
being O
' O
protect O
' O
by O
a O
stiff O
felt O
- O
like O
materialIn O
the O
end O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
travel O
with O
your O
macbook O

The O
key O
surface O
is O
not O
matt O
finish O
, O
so O
if O
your O
fingers O
are O
oily O
, O
the O
keyboard O
would O
look O
soiled O
. O

Then O
I O
left O
it O
to O
charge O
for O
24 O
- O
30 O
full O
hours O
( O
as O
per O
most O
batteries O
) O
and O
NOTHING O
! O
! O

No O
upgrades O
, O
everything O
except O
RAM O
slot O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
reach O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
computer O
primarily O
for O
photo O
and O
video O
editing O
and O
so O
far O
, O
my O
results O
have O
been O
excellent O
. O

No O
problems O
encountered O
so O
far O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

Checked O
it O
out O
and O
thought O
I O
'd O
get O
one O
. O

Cue O
the O
Belkin O
hub O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
squeeze O
the O
cables O
through O
it O
and O
mount O
the O
base O
plate O
under O
the O
desk O
. O

The O
remote O
is O
horrible O
. O

And O
for O
the O
USB O
N600 O
, O
it O
's O
300 O
on O
G O
or O
300 O
on O
A. O
Bottom O
line O
: O
the O
higher O
number O
is O
n't O
as O
sexy O
as O
I O
had O
originally O
thought O
, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
other O
variables O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
Firewire O
or O
HDMI O
. O

So O

I O
think O
it O
is O
great O
quality O
and O
value O
versus O
other O
brands O
. O

I O
generally O
do O
n't O
like O
these O
kinds O
of O

because O
they O
tend O
to O
lack O
good O
touch O

but O
this O
one O
is O
actually O
excellent O

My O
laptops O
are O
currently O
useless O
, O
plan O
on O
returning O
the O
router O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
set O
of O
these O
units O
I O
have O
purchased O
. O

Yet O
( O
Cloning O
) O

I O
noticed O
that O
I O
made O
more O
mistakes O
on O
this O
laptop O

I O
love O
this O
backpack O

, O
due O
to O
weight O
or O
balance O
causing O
damage O
to O
both O
devices O
. O

It O
's O
not O
often O
I O
need O
this O
, O
but O
so O
far O
over O
the O
months O
I O
've O
had O
it O
this O
plug O
has O
worked O
perfectly O
every O
time O
. O

The O
volume O
is O
actually O
pretty O
good O
, O
not O
great O
. O

connected O
to O
the O

) O
, O
because O
I O
can O
type O
much O
faster O
on O
it O
. O

The O
second O
thing O
I O
noticed O
is O
the O
size O
of O
the O
keys O
and O
trackpad O
are O
incredibly O
small O
. O

The O
idea O
that O
the O
company O
tries O
to O
pawn O
this O
off O
as O
a O
sleeve O
designed O
for O
the O
MBA O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

; O
laptop O
perfectly O
... O
really O
good O
basic O
protection O
for O
the O
laptop O
, O
... O
and O
a O
fair O
/ O
good O
price O
. O

What O
first O
attracted O
me O
to O
this O
case O
was O
the O
color O
and O

I O
did O
n't O
buy O
this O
machine O
on O
Amazon O
but O
found O
myself O
here O
looking O
for O
mobo O
specs O
regarding O
RAM O
slots O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
because O
I O
had O
a O
set O
of O
5 O
. O

Consequently O
, O
there O
's O
camera O
noise O
in O
every O
video O
, O
which O
is O
surprisingly O
loud O
considering O

Good O
buy O
. O

Even O
though O
this O
Chill O
Pad O
has O
amazing O
potentials O
, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
NON O
- O
CARCINOGENIC O
notebook O
coolers O
out O
there O
that O
can O
perform O
just O
as O
well O
with O
a O
longer O
width O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
neoprene O
cushion O
sleeve O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
one O
extra O
strike O
against O
it O
, O
I O
could O
find O
no O
way O
to O
single O
or O
dual O
boot O
Linux O
, O
not O
Ubuntu O
or O
Mint O
, O
properly O
on O
the O
machine O
, O
even O
using O
a O
USB O

flash O
drive O
like O
a O
hard O
drive O
. O

The O
power O
brick O
can O
get O
pretty O
warm O
, O
which O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
cheap O
after O
market O
chargers O

I O
purchased O
this O
unit O
from O
Amazon O
from O
the O
Warehouse O
Deals O
section O
which O
is O
generally O
used O
equipment O

works O
very O
well O

Only O

Aside O
from O
that O

I O
've O
ordered O
a O

do O
not O
expect O
this O

to O
last O
me O
more O
than O
1 O
- O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
ordered O
these O
thinking O
the O
sound O
and O
fit O
would O
be O
great O
. O

I O
used O
this O
pack O
for O
a O
photo O

and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
all O
my O
gear O
-- O
DSRL O

three O

and O
lots O

I O
scroll O

then O
I O
scroll O
back O
up O

find O
I O
have O
to O

some O

The O

has O
a O
very O
clean O
look O

and O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
finally O
embrace O
the O
new O
age O
of O
personal O
computing O
with O
a O

The O

really O

THAT O

I O
am O

Most O
likely O
, O
the O
battery O
will O
be O
the O
first O
component O
to O
give O
up O

The O
side O

are O
small O
for O

not O
super O
helpful O
, O
but O
better O
than O
nothing O
. O

For O
this O
basic O
5-Series O
set O
, O
it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
bells O
and O
whistles O
in O
its O
menu O
. O

but O
I O
can O
tell O
a O
large O
difference O
when O
its O
in O
operation O
. O

The O
battery O
last O
just O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
time O
as O
any O
other O
laptop O
and O
was O
much O
needed O
also O
took O
about O
a O
week O
to O
get O
here O

I O
stopped O
doing O
short O
4min O
clips O
at O
a O
time O
of O
recording O
on O
my O
gopro O
and O
now O
just O
hit O
record O
and O
let O
it O
go O
usually O
ending O
up O
with O
now O
a O
huge O
file O
I O
have O
to O
convert O
( O
2 O
. O
5GB++ O
at O
a O
time O
) O
but O
that O
same O
file O
is O
a O
breeze O
for O
this O
Ultrabook O
, O
that O
huge O
file O
maybe O
20 O
- O
30minutes O
only O
takes O
about O
5 O
minutes O
to O
process O
. O

It O
is O
not O
perfectly O
snug O
in O
the O
socket O
, O
but O
so O
far O
it O
has O
not O
popped O
out O
, O
not O
even O
when O
I O
intentionally O
bumped O
it O
around O
some O
. O

found O
that O
although O
this O
docking O
station O
has O
two O
monitor O

( O

- O

) O
, O
you O
can O
only O
use O
one O

it O

a O
time O

It O
's O
a O
great O

even O
at O

you O
can O
close O
it O

and O
just O
like O
a O

it O
will O

This O
paean O
to O

is O
n't O
without O
some O

BUT O
, O
I O
have O
never O
found O
a O

EDITED O
NOTE O
: O

First O
, O
know O
that O
this O
review O
applies O
to O
a O
unit O
I O
bought O
USED O
. O

This O
device O
makes O
a O
high O
pitched O
squeal O
because O
of O
the O
usb O
plugs O
. O

For O
a O
few O
bucks O
more O
than O
theblackororangeversions O
, O
why O
not O
? O

Overall O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
good O
computer O
briefcase O
for O
business O
travel O
. O

The O
cord O
can O
be O
lengthened O
or O
go O
shorter O
by O
pulling O
the O
mouse O
out O
away O
from O
the O
USB O
connection O
. O

There O
are O
countless O
USB O
devices O
out O
there O
and O
many O
of O
them O
are O
compatible O
with O
the O
Transformer O
. O

The O
AC O
adapter O
and O
3 O
. O
5 O
mini O
jack O
cords O
are O
included O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
buy O
them O
after O
- O
the O
- O
fact O
. O

The O
main O
center O
compartment O
is O
big O
enough O
for O
a O
laptop O
but O
there O
is O
no O
cushioning O
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

It O
worked O
flawlessly O
. O

I O
got O
used O
to O
it O
pretty O
quickly O
though O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
issues O
now O
. O

Pros O
-- O
Runs O
quiet O
and O
cool O
. O
Used O
in O
on O
my O
lap O
for O
several O
hours O
and O
it O
barely O
gets O
warmer O
than O
a O
Time O
magazine O
. O

It O
may O
not O
seem O
like O
much O
, O
but O
a O
MacBook O
Pro O
weighs O
about O
5 O
. O

Update O
, O
after O
trying O
a O
second O
supply O
I O
had O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

its O
not O
as O
user O
friendly O
as O
previous O
versions O
of O
windows O

Has O
great O
sound O
that O
is O
more O
dynamic O
than O
if O
you O
only O
listen O
to O
one O
earbud O
that O
is O
normally O
2 O
. O

I O
go O
and O
this O
bag O
works O
really O
well O
. O

I O
used O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
this O
past O
week O
on O
the O
road O
and O
it O
performed O
like O
a O
champ O
! O

The O
bottom O

this O
is O

fantastic O

I O
ca O

If O
you O
have O
run O
out O
of O

ports O
on O
your O
computer O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
USB O
octopus O
. O

The O
old O
keyboard O
had O
seen O
too O
many O
miles O
, O
and O
finally O
started O
producing O
wrong O
characters O
or O
no O
characters O
when O
I O
pressed O
certain O
keys O
. O

I O
have O
ordered O
the O
upgrades O
and O
will O
update O
this O
post O
when O
I O
do O
so O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O

I O
hope O
my O
satisfaction O
continues O
, O
the O
first O
three O
weeks O
were O
good O
! O

The O
new O
banner O
bars O
at O
the O
top O
/ O
bottom O
of O
the O
screen O
keep O
you O
from O
having O
to O
search O
for O
basic O
program O
information O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
anyone O
looking O
to O
extend O
the O
life O
of O
a O
VGA O
monitor O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
of O
the O
battery O
life O
holds O
up O
to O
the O
description O
because O
I O
only O
use O
it O
for O
2 O
- O
4 O
hours O
at O
a O
time O
. O

I O
have O
relatively O
small O
hands O
for O
a O
big O
guy O
, O
and O
the O
act O
of O
typing O
across O
the O
touch O
pad O
made O
it O
somewhat O
awkward O
. O

Much O
better O
than O
a O
neoprene O
version O
that O
I O
checked O
out O
in O
terms O
of O
bulk O
and O
protective O
function O
. O

The O
display O
is O
is O
winner O
too O
! O

There O
are O
just O
a O
few O
things O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
crazy O
about O
with O
the O
VivoBook O
. O

Bottom O
line O
' O
do O
n't O
buy O
it O
' O

Seems O
quite O
sturdy O
as O
well O
. O

It O
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
college O
student O
like O
me O
and O
maybe O
for O
business O
workers O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
glad O
they O
have O
the O
conversion O

Based O
on O
my O
experience O
with O
the O

I O
purchased O
both O

Being O

quality O
, O
strong O
volume O
. O

Since O
the O
speakers O
are O
made O
out O
of O
leather O
material O
and O
can O
fit O
around O
your O
whole O
ear O
( O
depending O
on O
your O
ear O
size O
) O
, O
it O
gets O
warm O
fast O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
this O
adapter O
has O
a O
very O
, O
very O
short O
range O
and O
does O
n't O
work O
very O
well O
a O
wall O
or O
two O
in O
between O
the O
routers O
. O

That O
means O
if O
you O
are O
watching O
a O
movie O
and O
accidentally O
press O
stop O
instead O
of O
pause O
, O
it O
's O
best O
to O
watch O
the O
rest O
on O
a O
computer O
. O

Works O
well O
with O
my O
additional O
7 O
' O
Samsung O
tablet O
also O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
you O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
hook O
into O
your O
USB O
port O
and O
that O
's O
it O
. O

Both O
ends O
bridge O
the O
two O
media O
types O
( O
powerline O
and O
Ethernet O
) O
and O
allow O
the O
network O
traffic O
to O
flow O
across O
both O
media O
types O
. O

I O
have O
encountered O
no O
problems O
with O
rips O
or O
tears O
in O
the O
year O
that O
I O
have O
been O
using O
it O
, O
and O
I O
always O
have O
about O
10 O
lbs O
of O
equipment O
in O
it O
. O

This O
laptop O
takes O
quite O
some O
time O
to O
fully O
charge O
. O

That O
is O
great O
protection O
for O
important O
files O
and O
priceless O
photographs O
. O

So O
I O
bought O
this O
Chromebook O
from O
Amazon O
and O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

If O
you O
are O
n't O
looking O
for O
one O
that O
will O
fit O
over O
both O
the O
screen O
and O
keyboard O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
considerIVSO O
Slim O
Smart O
Cover O
Case O
. O

It O
is O
working O
well O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
on O
sale O
, O
and O
the O
list O
price O
was O
more O
than O
$ O
150 O
. O

Added O
a O
128 O
GB O
USB3 O
thumbdrive O
to O
the O
purchase O

You O
use O
it O
to O
grab O
the O
pen O
nib O
to O
pull O
it O
out O
to O
replace O
the O
pen O
tips O
. O

This O
is O
nice O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anybody O
, O
but O
the O
build O
quality O
of O
it O
is O
not O
quite O
what O
I O
expected O
. O

I O
am O
half O
way O
across O
the O
house O
from O
the O
wireless O
router O
( O
about O
50 O
feet O
away O
) O
, O
and O
my O
internet O
connection O
is O
super O
fast O
with O
no O
dropouts O
or O
disconnects O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
very O
fast O
with O
an O
Intel O
I5 O
in O
it O
and O
decent O
amount O
of O
RAM O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
you O
can O
easily O
unscrew O
it O
for O
cleaning O
. O

I O
really O
debated O
back O
and O
forth O
for O
a O
while O
before O
purchasing O
the O
Expedition O
5 O
pack O
. O

Price O
is O
acceptable O
. O

The O
software O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
capable O
of O
a O
more O
nuanced O
backup O
, O
such O
as O
backing O
up O
the O
mac O
mail O
or O
important O
system O
configuration O
files O
. O

I O
installed O
about O
20 O
of O
these O
in O
POS O
machines O
( O
paired O
with O
Intel O
6205AGN O
dual O
- O
band O
cards O
) O
. O

One O
thing O
i O
really O
appreciate O
is O
ASUS O

All O
of O
the O
Siemens O
4200 O
series O
phones O
have O
a O
speakerphone O
built O
into O
both O
the O
base O
and O
remote O
units O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
with O
the O
Tamrac O
was O
that O
the O
zipper O
for O
the O
camera O
compartment O
is O
the O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
bag O
and O
goes O
horizontally O
. O

got O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O

I O
picked O
up O
another O
one O
at O
Office O
Max O
because O
they O
had O
a O
special O
. O

and O
I O
will O
buy O
another O
for O
a O
spare O
, O
keeping O
it O
charged O
weekly O
. O

You O
know O
going O
in O
that O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
that O
great O
, O
but O
I O
still O
could O
n't O
help O
being O
a O
little O
disappointed O
. O

An O
excellent O
product O
at O
a O
teriffic O
price O
. O

This O
replaces O
a O
toshiba O
lcd O
that O
I O
am O
giving O
to O
a O
family O
member O
, O
a O
32inch O
lv32hl67u O
( O
I O
think O
that O
s O
the O
model O
) O
which O
was O
a O
pretty O
solid O
lcd O
itself O
, O
not O
samsung O
/ O
sony O
good O
but O
better O
than O
the O
competing O
sharps O
, O
vizios O
, O
phillips O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
monitor O
itself O
is O
gorgeous O
- O
the O
colours O
are O
represented O
very O
well O
, O
and O
after O
spending O
some O
time O
in O
my O
NVIDIA O
control O
panel O
I O
had O
the O
gamma O
and O
contrast O
( O
etc O
. O
) O

This O
has O
a O
flap O
that O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

That O
means O
you O
can O
connect O
to O
your O
business O
or O
school O
network O
. O

The O
only O
think O
I O
will O
ding O
it O
for O
is O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
stiff O
. O

It O
is O
much O
slower O
, O
but O
still O
faster O
than O
when O
I O
tried O
the O
regular O
USB2 O
connectors O
on O
the O
MBP O
. O

Sound O
quality O
perfect O
. O

It O
fit O
the O
computer O
perfectly O
and O
is O
well O
made O
, O
equal O
to O
cases O
we O
saw O
at O
local O
stores O
for O
much O
higher O
prices O
. O

UPDATE O
- O
After O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
use O
, O
the O
unit O
no O
longer O
gets O
hot O
on O
carpet O
. O

We O
have O
a O
new O
iPad O
, O
and O
the O
screen O
picks O
up O
fingerprints O
like O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
picks O
up O
clues O
. O

I O
did O
however O
have O
a O
problem O
installing O
this O
on O
redhat O

and O
it O
was O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

This O
computer O
definately O
is O
not O
it O
's O
15&#34 O
; O
counterpart O
, O
so O
make O
no O
mistake O
in O
that O
. O

If O
you O
've O
an O
active O
user O
of O
your O
laptop O
and O
travel O
with O
it O
I O
can O
certainly O
see O
this O
being O
an O
issue O
requiring O
you O
to O
clean O
the O
inside O
every O
now O
and O
then O
. O

" O
Wow O
my O
new O
phone O
just O
arrived O
in O
the O
mail O

Tested O
on O
both O
my O
brand O
- O
new O
Mac O
mini O
and O
my O
2007-era O
Macbook O
, O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
on O
either O
. O

Since O
the O
interior O
case O
fits O
the O
tablet O
snugly O
rather O
than O
trying O
to O
hold O
it O
in O
place O
with O
elastic O
on O
the O
corners O
, O
it O
should O
fit O
just O
as O
well O
a O
year O
from O
now O
. O

This O
cable O
is O
also O
easily O
obtainable O
if O
ever O
lost O
. O

When O
I O
downloaded O
the O
new O
Mavericks O
OSX O
, O
the O
tablet O
quit O
working O
entirely O
. O

I O
recommend O
telling O
your O
old O
, O
inefficient O
and O
probably O
corrupt O
phone O
company O
BYE O
- O
BYE O
! O

In O
reading O
other O
reviews O
, O
I O
noticed O
this O
product O
mismatch O
problem O
seems O
to O
be O
pervasive O
; O
seems O
to O
indicate O
someone O
, O
somewhere O
, O
is O
asleep O
at O
the O
switch O
... O

Last O
week O
I O
filed O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
BBB O
. O

After O
further O
inspection O
, O
I O
noted O
there O
was O
a O
very O
small O
gap O
between O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
plugs O
on O
the O
connector O
and O
on O
the O
original O
battery O
it O
was O
at O
the O
other O
end O
. O

The O
Dell O
still O
worked O
, O
but O
barely O
. O

it O
's O
pretty O
packed O
, O
but O
not O
overloaded O
. O

More O
stable O
than O
the O
typical O
two O
prong O
adapter O
. O

While O
the O
portability O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
, O
the O
size O
and O
stability O
is O
what O
is O
best O
about O
this O
hub O
. O

Got O
it O
and O
stuck O
it O
behind O
my O
TV O
nice O
a O
carefully O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
stick O
too O
well O
. O

The O
display O
is O
gorgeous O
! O

Its O
wireless O
antenna O
picked O
up O
all O
of O
the O
networks O
that O
I O
've O
asked O
it O
to O
and O
held O
a O
very O
steady O
and O
reliable O
connection O
. O

I O
now O
wonder O
how O
many O
5 O
star O
reviews O
were O
written O
in O
response O
to O
Nuforce O
's O
offer O
of O
afuture O
discount O
if O
one O
wrote O
a O
positive O
Amazon O
review O
( O
I O
was O
forwarded O
a O
copy O
of O
theemail O
Nuforce O
sent O
about O
this O
) O
. O

Basically O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
product O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
see O
if O
you O
're O
in O
or O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
a O
hotspot O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
for O
if O
you O
're O
driving O
or O
walking O
past O
somewhere O
and O
wish O
to O
know O
if O
you O
'll O
have O
wireless O
connectivity O
inside O
. O

I O
would O
have O
given O
this O
5 O
stars O
if O
Apple O
had O
included O
a O
HDMI O
port O
. O

and O
I O
love O
the O
way O
it O
looks O
. O

I O
actually O
like O
this O
however O
though O
some O
people O
may O
not O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
Dell O
Inspiron O
8600 O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Purchased O
this O
to O
replace O
the O
JLAB O
Bi O
- O
Flex O
USB O
external O
speaker O
which O
I O
could O
never O
get O
to O
work O
consistently O
. O

I O
keep O
this O
in O
my O
laptop O
bag O
and O
use O
it O
when O
I O
'm O
away O
from O
my O
offices O
. O

Looks O
repackaged O
with O
a O
wavy O
top O
. O

I O
found O
the O
mouse O
to O
be O
very O
responsive O
on O
an O
ordinary O
tabletoptaking O
away O
the O
need O
to O
have O
a O
mouse O
pad O
. O

This O
was O
a O
our O
second O
pick O
for O
a O
mic O
extension O
cable O
because O
it O
was O
thin O
and O
lightweight O
and O
well O
made O
. O

4GhZ/250 O
GB O
version O
, O
because O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
the O
top O
tier O
in O
the O
13 O
inch O
Macbook O
family O
. O

This O
antenna O
fits O
the O
bill O
... O

I O
am O
not O
entirely O
sure O
if O
the O
window O
8 O
is O
slowing O
it O
down O
, O
probably O
not O
the O
best O
purchase O
I O
have O
made O
, O
but O
just O
do O
n't O
wanna O
deal O
with O
returns O
. O

This O
Connctland O
cooling O
stand O
is O
sturdy O
and O
fits O
/ O
cools O
a O
15 O
. O
6 O
inch O
laptop O
. O

I O
'm O
hoping O
this O
new O
case O
lasts O
as O
long O
as O
my O
old O
one O
. O

After O
reading O
several O
reviews O
, O
I O
selected O
the O
Acer O
C720 O
Chromebook O
for O
use O
at O
home O
. O

but O
we O
added O
another O
free O
mail O
program O
that O
's O
working O
fine O
. O

Hopefully O
no O
one O
buys O
such O
an O
old O
laptop O
when O
there O
are O
superior O
models O
out O
now O
for O
less O
. O

These O
are O
great O
little O
speakers O
for O
the O
price O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
after O
I O
received O
this O
computer O
was O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
HDD O
and O
migrate O
my O
operating O
system O
to O
a O
Samsung O
SDD O
and O
boy O

This O
little O
sucker O
works O
great O
... O
plug O
& O
play O
. O

In O
the O
store O
I O
was O
comparing O
this O
panel O
to O
a O
46a550 O
and O
46a530 O
all O
at O
their O
factory O
default O
settings O
. O

No O
issues O
so O
far O
. O

If O
you O
use O
the O
firefox O
browser O
( O
or O
any O
non O
- O
touch O
optimized O
program O
based O
on O
the O
desktop O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
slightly O
more O
difficult O
to O
do O
things O
like O
open O
/ O
close O
tabs O
, O
press O
the O
close O
icon O
, O
etc O
. O

but O
oh O
well O
. O

but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
for O
me O
. O

The O
software O
installation O
was O
nearly O
flawless O
. O

140 O
- O
172As O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fan O
does O
help O
when O
you O
are O
hardcore O
gaming O
, O
keeping O
it O
around O
an O
average O
of O
10 O
degrees O
cooler O
, O
which O
is O
significantI O
would O
also O
like O
to O
add O
that O
this O
is O
not O
very O
comfortable O
on O
the O
lap O
with O
the O
back O
pegs O
sticking O
out O
, O
but O
with O
its O
regular O
position O
it O
feels O
okay O
, O

Additionally O
, O
I O
have O
half O
a O
dozen O
wireless O
devices O
connected O
including O
two O
networked O
TV O
's O
, O
a O
PS3 O
, O
and O
an O
Apple O
TV O
. O

I O
found O
that O
the O
radio O
has O
an O
auto O
- O
tuning O
seek O
and O
search O
function O
, O
but O
still O
have O
n't O
figured O
what O
buttons O
do O
what O
yet O
. O

2 O
Macbook O
with O
4 O
G O
of O
ram O
, O
and O
this O
is O
almost O
the O
same O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
3 O
prong O
wall O
connection O
( O
the O
ground O
wire O
, O
the O
positive O
, O
and O
the O
negative O
) O
. O

To O
add O
insult O
to O
injury O
, O
the O
manufacturer O
( O
Digital O
Personas O
) O
has O
ceased O
support O
for O
this O
scanner O
to O
concentrate O
more O
corporate O
things O
and O
less O
on O
the O
consumer O
market O
. O

Just O
see O
the O
web O
forums O
for O
all O
the O
problems O
that O
users O
are O
having O
with O
ALL O
Apple O
products O
. O

It O
's O
like O
they O
're O
a O
part O
of O
my O
family O
now O
. O

Another O
feature O
I O
like O
, O
When O
you O
plug O
into O
the O
USB O
you O
find O
a O
replacement O
USB O
port O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
plug O
. O

After O
countless O
hours O
of O
searching O
on O
the O
internet O
I O
was O
able O
to O
find O
a O
generic O
driver O
for O
it O
, O
but O
only O
after O
hours O
of O
searching O
, O
literally O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
save O
a O
penny O
, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
, O
I O
went O
with O
this O
MBP O
. O

The O
ssd O
gives O
this O
aging O
laptop O
a O
new O
life O
. O

cable O
does O
what O
it O
says O
good O
quality O
love O
using O
it O
ca O
n't O
notice O
any O
degrade O
in O
video O
quality O
at O
all O
and O
the O
blue O
looks O
nice O

Had O
the O
sotware O
worked O
, O
I O
would O
have O
given O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

The O
subwoofer O
in O
back O
kicks O
off O
of O
the O
wall O
and O
fills O
the O
entire O
room O
! O

I O
find O
it O
more O
than O
adequate O
. O

2/15/14 O
I O
have O
verified O
that O
once O
the O
driver O
is O
installed O
, O
any O
video O
( O
even O
before O
it O
starts O
playing O
) O
will O
make O
my O
pc O
crash O
and O
reboot O
. O

The O
adapter O
installed O
in O
minutes O
and O
does O
everything O
the O
seller O
claimed O
. O

I O
am O
typing O
this O
review O
on O
the O
keyboard O
and O
as O

can O

start O

Excellent O
product O
! O

The O
bag O
is O
well O
padded O
once O
the O
netbook O
is O
in O
there O
. O

For O
this O
I O
deduct O
one O
star O
. O

And O
yes O
, O
Windows O
8 O
is O
very O
different O
. O

The O
pen O
tablet O
is O
a O
nice O
feature O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
personally O
like O
to O
use O
it O
more O
, O
but O
my O
husband O
always O
has O
this O
computer O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
the O
life O
of O
the O
battery O
will O
be O
the O
same O
as O
the O
Apple O
original O
, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
you O
can O
buy O
3 O
of O
them O
for O
the O
price O
of O
1 O
Apple O
original.- O

Just O
needed O
something O
to O
test O
and O
find O
that O
little O
man O
on O
the O
moon O
. O

I O
would O
advise O
you O
to O
decide O
in O
advance O
- O
vertical O
or O
horizontal O
! O

The O
edges O
have O
a O
little O
extra O
padding O
, O
which O
is O
nice O
when O
you O
have O
to O
carry O
your O
laptop O
around O
for O
a O
while O
. O

devices O
connected O
at O
a O
time O

When O
I O
called O
to O
ask O
why O
I O
was O
hung O
up O
on O
repeatedly O
. O

Had O
the O
2nd O
one O
about O
30 O
days O
use O
it O
2 O
or O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
. O

The O
Logitech O
software O
is O
capable O
and O
far O
more O
stable O
than O
earlier O
incarnations O
. O

With O
this O
configuration O
, O
I O
can O
pick O
up O
and O
visit O
a O
client O
site O
( O
or O
sit O
by O
the O
pool O
) O
without O
having O
to O
copy O
files O
or O
configure O
for O
a O
road O
trip O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
enough O
about O
the O
sound O
quality O
that O
this O
player O
offers O
, O
it O
is O
unbelievable O
. O

I O
like O
the O
quick O
start O
function O
. O

That O
's O
not O
to O
say O
this O
computer O
is O
slow O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
any O
faster O
than O
the O
dual O
core O
chip O
from O
four O
years O
ago O
. O

For O
that O
matter O
to O
get O
all O
of O
the O
functions O
of O
your O
printer O
to O
work O
properly O
you O
should O
load O
the O
software O
from O
disk O
or O
other O
media O
that O
came O
with O
your O
printer O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

While O
the O
fan O
does O
n't O
blow O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
air O
from O
the O
laptop O
cooler O
, O
it O
does O
blow O
out O
enough O
air O
to O
keep O
the O
laptop O
's O
temps O
lower O
than O
without O
it O
. O

If O
so O
i O
'm O
expecting O
this O
one O
to O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
this O
at O
a O
discount O
. O

There O
might O
be O
two O
schools O
of O
thought O
on O
having O
such O
a O
short O
USB O
cord O
--- O
it O
's O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
reach O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
laptop O
monitor O
to O
the O
USB O
plug O
, O
leaving O
some O
slack O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
paid O
extra O
for O
something O
that O
should O
have O
come O
in O
the O
box O
- O
though O
I O
suppose O
it O
is O
handy O
to O
have O
a O
spare O
PS O
. O

I O
assume O
this O
is O
an O
attempt O
at O
keeping O
the O
chip O
cool O
. O

Unit O
did O
not O
come O
with O
one O
or O
any O
way O
to O
power O
the O
PATA O
drive O
. O

As O
to O
the O
laptop O
, O
you O
will O
definitely O
be O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

Not O
that O
I O
used O
it O
this O
way O
, O
but O
thought O
I O
would O
note O
if O
you O
flip O
this O
over O
it O

The O
reason O
I O
gave O
it O
only O
four O
stars O
, O
is O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
stay O
in O
as O
well O
as O
the O
original O
battery O
. O

Hopefully O
I O
never O
have O
to O
buy O
this O
again O
as O
all O
things O
are O
SD O
and O
MicroSD O
now O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
plastic O
is O
n't O
part O
of O
the O
operational O
guts O
, O
so O
even O
if O
the O
top O
of O
the O
plastic O
around O
the O
hole O
broke O
your O
device O
would O
still O
be O
functional O
. O

Heavy O
duty O
material O
; O
the O
pocked O
for O
the O
laptop O
is O
well O
padded O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
now O

Loose O
power O
in O
a O
plane O
or O
hotel O
at O
night O
, O
and O

I O
've O
had O
the O
old O
Flip O
Ultra O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
now O
, O
and O
just O
picked O
up O
the O
newer O
Flip O
Mino O
. O

We O
purchased O
this O
battery O
for O
a O
Dell O
Vostro O
that O
the O
kids O
now O
have O
. O

What O
I O
can O
share O
with O
you O
is O
what O
happens O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
performs O
. O

Well O
worth O
the O
money O
to O
keep O
the O
family O
happy O
. O

Please O
go O
to O
Amazon O
. O

2000mAh O
battery O
pack O
will O
charge O
most O
phones O
from O
0 O
% O
to O
100 O
% O
on O
one O
charge O
. O

When O
I O
did O
this O
it O
saw O
the O
b O
/ O
g O
SSID O
( O
again O
, O
it O
never O
saw O
the O
N O
SSID O
) O
but O
could O
not O
connect O
. O

I O
like O
the O
feature O
set O
on O
Wagan O
's O
EL2601 O
Inverter O
. O

Have O
had O
no O
problems O
and O
it O
works O
on O
my O
Dell O
Inspirion O
1545 O
very O
well O
. O

It O
's O
worked O
great O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
! O

BUT O
TO O
MY O
ANNOYANCE O
IT O
LASTED O
1 O
HOUR O
AND O
THE O
GREEN O
LITE O
WENTOUT O
. O

The O
2000 O
models O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
best O
right O
now O
. O

The O
system O
software O
recognized O
it O
just O
fine O
. O

Cables O
are O
a O
bit O
short O
and O
the O
silk O
like O
carrying O
case O
/ O
bag O
is O
ok O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
an O
old O
laptop O
for O
my O
mom O
to O
use O
which O
only O
had O
512 O
MB O
( O
2 O
256 O
MB O
sticks O
) O
. O

This O
means O
the O
range O
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

This O
drive O
came O
, O
it O
's O
plug O
and O
play O

If O
I O
was O
traveling O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
, O
I O
might O
bring O
the O
Series O
5 O
instead O
of O
my O
13 O
" O
Macbook O
Pro O
, O
though O
only O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
intend O
to O
get O
any O
" O
heavy O
" O
work O
done O
. O

So O
you O
have O
to O
use O
an O
adapter O
from O
full O
size O
USB O
to O
mini O
USB O
. O

The O
line O
is O
a O
little O
short O
while O
it O
is O
made O
to O
be O
portable O
that O
the O
wire O
is O
made O
on O
the O
speaker O
. O

It O
is O
very O
thin O
plastic O
and O
is O
pretty O
much O
incapable O
of O
holding O
any O
weight O
without O
carefully O
manipulating O
it O
first O
. O

I O
have O
to O
recouple O
it O
about O
once O
per O
day O
. O

If O
you O
use O
your O
laptop O
often O
and O
move O
it O
around O
, O
better O
off O
going O
with O
an O
original O
replacement O
. O

Three O
finger O
taps O
and O

When O
it O
works O
though O
, O
it O
has O
blazing O
speeds O
just O
as O
fast O
as O
my O
steady O
30 O
Mbps O
wired O
connection O
in O
the O
basement O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
about O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
ago O

The O
charger O
came O
promptly O
as O
said O
. O

Or O
you O
can O
plug O
in O
a O
thumb O
drive O
or O
microSD O
card O
with O
music O
folders O
on O
it O
and O
play O
them O
out O
loud O
. O

I O
ran O
mine O
next O
to O
my O
trim O
molding O
and O
it O
blends O
in O
nicely O
, O
however O
if O
ran O
across O
an O
open O
surface O
, O
you O
will O
see O
the O
" O
tape O
" O
as O
expected O
. O

This O
is O
attached O
to O
that O
same O
section O
that O
protects O
the O
laptop O
; O
just O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
it O
. O

, O
my O
laptop O
has O
two O
Non O
- O
fan O
vents O
on O
the O
bottom O
and O
one O
fan O
supported O
Air O
- O
vent O
on O
the O
top O
left O
( O
This O
is O
for O
sucking O
air O
in O
by O
the O
Graphics O
Card O
fan O
) O
. O

It O
has O
a O
metallic O
appearance O
, O
though O
on O
closer O
inspection O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
just O
an O
ordinary O
touchpad O
. O

Besides O
these O
new O
features O
, O
this O
13-inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
carries O
over O
its O
dimensions O
, O
appearance O
, O
and O
weight O
from O
the O
previous O
13-inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

It O
is O
loud O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
CRYSTAL O
CLEAR O
, O
POWERFUL O
BASS O
loud O
. O

I O
have O
found O
that O
there O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
stations O
that O
sometimes O
get O
picked O
up O
and O
sometimes O
do O
n't O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
cooler O
is O
that O
fact O
that O
the O
fans O
can O
be O
moved O
according O
to O
where O
your O
laptop O
vents O
are O
. O

The O
battery O
works O
fine O
on O
my O
2009 O
macbook O
pro O
with O
OS O
X O
Mavericks O
. O

You O
can O
never O
have O
enough O
protection O
. O

But O
the O
Windows O
laptops O
were O
just O
not O
compelling O
at O
that O
price O
. O

but O
I O
'm O
willing O
to O
bet O
that O
if O
you O
can O
show O
me O
a O
person O
that O
says O
these O
coolers O
make O
a O
difference O
, O
I O
can O
show O
you O
a O
person O
that O
is O
doing O
some O
thing O
wrong O
or O
has O
fan O
/ O
s O
that O
are O
not O
working O
in O
a O
laptop O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
complaints O
about O
the O
wireless O
, O
but O
have O
n't O
encountered O
any O
problems O
connecting O
to O
my O
modest O
home O
network O
with O
Windows.(5 O
) O

was O
honestly O
afraid O
to O
use O
anything O
but O
old O
fashioned O

Within O
a O
block O
of O
ignoring O
its O
directions O
it O
has O
replotted O
a O
new O
course O
for O
you O
. O

The O
speakers O
sound O
good O
too O
. O

5 O
mm O
ports O
were O
all O
in O
line O
with O
one O
another O
and O
no O
extension O
cables O
were O
needed O
for O
my O
layout O
. O

so O
you O
are O
stuck O
with O
a O
1/4 O
" O
input O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
. O

I O
've O
looked O
at O
other O
competing O
products O
, O
and O
have O
been O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
this O
" O
older O
" O
model O
from O
SwissGear O
not O
only O
remains O
on O
the O
market O
, O
it O
's O
also O
one O
of O
the O
most O
highly O
- O
rated O
laptop O
bookbags O
-- O
even O
when O
compared O
to O
much O
more O
recent O
and O
expensive O
ones O
. O

Now O
the O
Easy O

Pros O
: O
Very O
nice O

Kept O
registering O
surges O
and O
shutting O
down O
. O

Does O
everything O
I O
need O
it O
to O
. O

Not O
too O
bad O
for O
a O
full O
dual O
core O
system O
. O

If O
the O
music O
player O
is O
already O
on O
, O
you O
need O
to O
exit O
and O
restart O
to O
have O
it O
automatically O
recognize O
the O
speaker O
, O
so O
plug O
in O
the O
speakers O
before O
you O
open O
the O
program O
you O
want O
to O
use O
to O
listen O
to O

The O
good O
: O
It O
's O
very O
sturdy O
and O
well O
- O
padded O
. O

Quick O
easy O

GREAT O
price O
compared O
to O
other O

. O

Late O

. O

Much O
more O
quiet O
than O
the O
previous O

we O
had O
. O

Running O
a O
new O
program O
for O
the O
first O
time O
did O
n't O
show O
any O
change O
, O
predictably O

The O
orange O
lining O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
see O
if O
there O
's O
anything O
floating O
around O
in O
there O
and O
the O
pocket O
( O
with O

is O
useful O

. O

Can O
I O
use O
the O
product O
? O

It O
does O
charge O
it O
, O
just O
at O
a O
slower O
rate O
and O
when O
i O
put O
my O
computer O
on O
hi O
perfomance O
it O
gets O
very O
hot O
but O
as O
long O
as O
it O
works O
ill O
take O
it O
over O
the O
$ O
60 O
one O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
looks O
nice O
and O
finish O
is O
great O
. O

Having O
used O
both O
this O
and O
the O
built O
- O
in O
rechargeable O
battery O
variants O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
's O
a O
tossup O
which O
is O
better O
. O

SanDisk O
makes O
quality O
drives O
, O
and O
this O
one O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

The O
up O
arrow O
on O
the O
keyboard O
just O
right O
of O
the O
right O
shift O
key O
, O
just O
under O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
Enter O
key O
, O
you O
hit O
it O
all O
the O
time O
and O
it O
gets O
so O
annoying O
. O

All O
in O
all O
this O
is O
an O
excellent O
mouse O
for O
travel O
. O

It O
does O
require O
2 O
cables O
to O
operate O
but O
they O
both O
go O
straight O
into O
your O
PC O
so O
there O
is O
no O
power O
plug O
for O
an O
outlet O
which O
makes O
it O
even O
greater O
in O
my O
book O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
familiar O
with O

; O

In O
addition O
, O
one O
of O

actually O

in O
half O

I O
was O
screwing O
the O

With O
the O

Once O
you O
know O
how O
it O
goes O
on O
, O
it O
's O
actually O
much O
better O
than O
the O

for O
the O
earlier O

. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
plan O
on O

, O
then O
this O
dock O
is O
great O
for O
work O
or O
watching O
movies O
! O

Good O
stuff O
: O
the O
screen O
is O
1024x600 O
, O
not O
quite O
a O
conventional O
resolution O
but O
enough O
for O
most O
purposes O
. O

The O
performance O
can O
not O
even O
be O
compared O
to O
any O
standalone O
player O
. O

I O
'll O
update O
my O
review O
. O

The O
world O
of O
laptops O
is O
horribly O
confusing O
because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
variations O
and O
options O
. O

Quick O
shipping O
and O
item O
is O
as O
described O
. O

so O
I O
bought O
this O
6-foot O
MediaBridge O
cable O
. O

A O
certain O
portion O
of O
extra O
online O
storage O
space O
should O
have O
been O
made O
available O
free O
to O
owners O
of O
a O
Google O
chromebook O
for O
the O
lifetime O
of O
the O
device O

one O
I O
bought O
was O
from O
Costco O

Beyond O
that O
, O
for O
the O
price O
point O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great O
laptop O
bag O
, O
looks O
good O
, O
feels O
well O
made O
, O
and O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
to O
others O
. O

Have O
fun O
and O
buy O
it O
today O
! O

I O
took O
this O
little O
speaker O
to O
work O
and O
every O
body O
can O
not O
believe O
how O
much O
sound O
can O
come O
out O
of O
a O
little O
device O
like O
this O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
me O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
remote O
control O
for O
my O
stereo O
setup O
which O
is O
actually O
an O
audio O
mixer O
connected O
to O
powered O
studio O
monitor O
speakers O
. O

The O
backups O
run O
pretty O
quickly O
- O
I O
can O
move O
4 O
gigs O
of O
photos O
off O
a O
CF O
card O
in O
about O
four O
minutes O
; O
the O
Epson O
does O
n't O
take O
forever O
to O
generate O
thumbnails O
so O
you O
can O
view O
your O
photos O
; O
and O
the O
user O
interface O
on O
the O
device O
itself O
is O
very O
intuitive O
. O

It O
looks O
and O
performs O
like O
a O
brand O
- O
new O
unit O
that O
would O
have O
cost O
many O
many O
times O
as O
much O
. O

Mini O
NB205-N210 O
fits O
her O
needs O
but O
the O
biggest O
advantage O
is O
the O
portability O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
laptop O
bag O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
and O
my O
other O
one O
was O
a O
Targus O
as O
well O
but O
let O
me O
say O
WOW O
what O
a O
big O
improvement O
! O
! O

I O
thought O
Antec O
quality O
is O
not O
so O
good O
. O

Cable O
lengths O
are O
more O
than O
adequate O
. O

Sound O
is O
excellent O
for O
all O
types O
of O
music O
. O

Easily O
adjusts O
to O
different O
head O
sizes O
but O
not O
small O
ones- O

it O
is O
perfectly O
transparent O
where O
the O
last O
one O
i O
had O
got O
fingerprints O
and O
actually O
interfered O
with O
the O
image O
of O
the O
screen O
. O

it O
is O
a O
good O
buy O
. O

I O
have O
been O
using O
thinkpad O
laptops O
for O
the O
past O
6 O
years O
and O
i O
love O
how O
they O
are O
reliable O
and O
well O
made O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
to O
upgrade O
my O
newly O
bought O
Mac O
Mini O
from O
4gigs O
to O
16gigs O
. O

Even O
when O
I O
get O
the O
positioning O
correct O
and O
it O
begins O
charging O
, O
sometimes O
the O
connection O
drops O
in O
and O
out O
stopping O
then O
resuming O
charging O
and O
always O
sounds O
the O
wireless O
charging O
alert O
. O

Bought O
this O
RAM O
for O
my O
Acer O
notebook O
. O

I O
expected O
this O
to O
an O
extent O
because O
hey- O

so O
I O
ended O
up O
giving O
my O
daughter O
my O
HP O
pavilion O
, O
dandelion O
breeze O

Although O
the O
volume O
was O
louder O
than O
the O
Altec O
speaker O
I O
am O
using O
now O
, O
the O
sound O
quality O
bothered O
me O
to O
the O
point O
that O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
. O

it O
's O
great O
having O
it O
on O
battery O

I O
never O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
use O
a O
computer O
for O
so O
long O
away O
from O
a O
power O
plug O
, O
this O
new O
air O
did O
it O
. O

It O
is O
NOT O
a O
big O
time O
business O
computer O
. O

While O
I O
think O
the O
design O
of O
included O
case O
( O
they O
call O
it O
a O
bumper O
) O
could O
be O
improved O
, O
it O
is O
VERY O
good O
at O
protecting O
the O
overall O
unit O
from O
drops O
( O
there O
are O
drop O
test O
videos O
on O
the O
Nabi O
website O
) O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
go O
through O
all O
the O
trouble O
of O
designing O
and O
fabricating O
something O
like O
this O
, O
knowing O
it O
wo O
n't O
work O
. O

and O
me O
losing O
valuable O
info O
. O

but O
if O
you O
like O
different O
and O
interesting O
designes O
, O
its O
pretty O
good O
macbook O
sleeve O
. O

I O
've O
had O
one O
of O
these O
for O
a O
good O
3 O
or O
4 O
months O
now O
with O
moderate O
usage O
. O

I O
put O
them O
into O
the O
keyboard O
, O
turned O
it O
on O
and O
pushed O
the O
button O
to O
link O
the O
iPad O
and O
keyboard O
with O
Bluetooth O
. O

The O
printer O
has O
a O
dedicated O
panel O
door O
, O
which O
opens O
without O
tools O
, O
and O
no O
tools O
are O
needed O
to O
install O
the O
memory O
module O
, O
either O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
the O
latest O
tech O
, O
but O
who O
cares O
? O

Carrying O
it O
on O
your O
shoulder O
bag O
feels O
like O
you O
are O
not O
carrying O
anything O
at O
all O
compared O
to O
the O
x220 O
. O

Over O
a O
foot O
tall O
, O
about O
4"to6 O
" O
deep O
( O
depending O
on O
what O
you O
put O
in O
adjacent O
compartments O
) O
, O
close O
to O
a O
foot O
wide O
, O
I O
also O
use O
it O
for O
spare O
clothes O
, O
jackets O
, O
towels O
or O
other O
bulky O
objects O
that O
need O
some O
serious O
room O
. O

Bought O
this O
for O
my O
daughter O
, O
she O
likes O
it O
and O
also O
like O
the O
way O
it O
hooks O
to O
the O
audio O
jack O
when O
not O
in O
use O
... O
less O
likely O
to O
lose O
or O
misplace O
it O
that O
way O
. O

So O
many O
of O
the O
less O
frequently O
operated O
functions O
are O
on O
menus O
and O
slightly O
more O
difficult O
to O
find O
. O

Screen O
protector O
is O
great O
. O

" O
re O
install O
windows O
" O
. O

Ok O
, O
maybe O
saying O
it O
's O
a O
miracle O
is O
a O
stretch O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
device O
primarily O
to O
encode O
VHS O
tapes O
to O
digital O
video O
files O
. O

Only O
has O
one O
ram O
slot O
accessible O
to O
the O
user O
, O
( O
the O
other O
ram O
chip O
is O
soldered O
on O
the O
mb O
. O
) O

Caselogic O
would O
have O
been O
better O
served O
by O
designing O
a O
better O
strap O
and O
padding O
system O
. O

For O
video O
, O
it O
has O
a O
DVI O
port O
and O
an O
RGB O
/ O
VGA O
type O
connector O
as O
well O
as O
a O
single O
DisplayPort O
connector O
. O

But O
nevertheless O
, O
the O
drive O
showed O
only O
4 O
KB O
of O
free O
space O
. O

It O
looks O
well O
made O
and O
does O
the O
job O
it O
is O
intended O
for O
, O
powering O
up O
his O
laptop O
. O

The O
WiFi O
I O
use O
is O
802 O
. O
11n O

The O
only O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
is O
that O
the O
USB O
cord O
would O
somehow O
catch O
on O
or O
rub O
against O
the O
fan O
causing O
either O
an O
annoying O
noise O
or O
a O
complete O
fan O
stoppage O
. O

It O
's O
on O
its O
last O
legs O
but O
it O
still O
operates O
better O
than O
my O
wife O
's O
newer O
Toshiba O
. O

Without O
the O
500 O
GB O
hard O
drive O
, O
this O
would O
have O
been O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
causal O
computer O
for O
lightweight O
use O
. O

nothing O
more O
, O
nothing O
less O
. O

Your O
camera O
can O
fly O
out O
the O
side O
access O
door O
, O
or O
your O
lenses O
can O
spew O
from O
the O
back O
door O
( O
if O
you O
forget O
to O
zip O
up).The O
only O
item O
above O
that O
matters O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
me O
is O
the O
last O
one O
. O

Happy O
Lappy O
! O
! O

Since O
I O
do O
n't O
travel O
a O
lot O
this O
feature O
is O
not O
worth O
double O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
other O
bags O
especially O
when O
you O
factor O
in O
the O
other O
drawbacks O
that O
comes O
with O
this O
Thule O
. O

It O
was O
3 O
dollars O
cheaper O
7 O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
's O
definitely O
worth O
the O
price O
! O

We O
ended O
up O
re O
- O
purposing O
this O
HTPC O
as O
a O
lightweight O
desktop O
PC O
, O
and O
the O
additional O
RAM O
seems O
to O
have O
helped O
a O
lot O
when O
using O
MS O
Office O
2010 O
applications O
. O

Should O
be O
charge O
up O
to O
100 O
% O
and O
work O
life O
about O
4 O
- O
4 O
. O
5 O
hours O
. O

My O
computer O
found O
the O
hardware O
before O
I O
even O
got O
done O
pushing O
it O
all O
the O
way O
in O
, O
lol O
.. O
epic O
. O

but O
I O
am O
finding O
that O
Google O
is O
doing O
a O
good O
job O
with O
the O
user O
happiness O
. O

There O
is O
no O
magnetic O
function O
as O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
on O
any O
adequate O
iPad O
cover O
and O
closing O
it O
requires O
placing O
an O
elastic O
around O
it O
. O

The O
software O
took O
this O
Microsoft O
- O
handicapped O
user O
about O
an O
hour O
to O
figure O
out O
, O
but O
if O
you O
work O
with O
it O
enough O
, O
you O
'll O
find O
you O
can O
learn O
something O
new O
every O
day O
. O

My O
husband O
is O
even O
impressed O
with O
the O
big O
sound O
of O
this O
little O
clock O
radio O
in O
our O
bathroom O
; O
I O
just O
formated O
an O
8 O
GB O
flash O
drive O
to O
FAT32 O
and O
loaded O
mp3s O
onto O
it O
; O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
anything O
like O
it O
anywhere O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
piece O
of O
equipment O
out O
there O
! O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

Note O
: O
if O
you O
shoot O
in O
RAW O
format O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
send O
pix O
directly O
to O
printer O
from O
camera O
via O
enclosed O
cord O

Even O
at O
idle O
speed O
the O
fan O
is O
too O
loud O
for O
anything O
other O
than O
a O
machine O
that O
is O
going O
to O
be O
tucked O
under O
your O
desk O
... O
far O
under O
your O
desk O
. O

I O
received O
this O
later O
than O
expected O
, O
but O
was O
a O
great O
addition O
to O
My O
Book O
Studio O
II O
. O

This O
netbook O
is O
the O
best O
in O
the O
biz O
right O
now O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use O
for O
the O
beginner O
but O
also O
a O
semi O
pro O
can O
do O
nice O
things O
with O
it O
. O

Adaptor O
works O
great O
and O
my O
sister O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
how O
fast O
it O
arrived O
. O

This O
was O
an O
easy O
upgrade O
and O
it O
's O
cost O
was O
n't O
too O
unreasonable O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
very O
stiff O
and O
protects O
well O
. O

Update O
: O
Since O
writing O
the O
original O
review O
I O
have O
abandoned O
using O
the O
dock O
with O
4 O
K O
monitors O
-- O
it O
's O
just O
too O
unreliable O
. O

The O
pockets O
are O
shaped O
appropriately O
for O
pens O
/ O
pencils O
, O
memory O
cards O
/ O
thumb O
drives O
, O
credit O
/ O
business O
cards O
, O
etc O
. O

Thunderbolt O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
unless O
you O
plan O
on O
buying O
a O
$ O
1 O
, O
000 O
drive O
array O
, O
or O
a O
$ O
1 O
, O
000 O
monitor O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
found O
a O
Tablet O
is O
much O
better O
than O
a O
Laptop O
, O
is O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
E O
- O
READING O
...... O

Good O
thing O
I O
only O
paid O
a O
few O
bucks O
for O
it O
. O

Love O
the O
normal O
size O
USB O
port O
but O
finding O
the O
mini O
HDMI O
port O
a O
problem O
to O
connect O
to O
my O
desktop O
monitor O
for O
a O
larger O
screen O
. O

Unless O
you O
screw O
this O
device O
down O
, O
you O
'll O
need O
two O
hands O
. O

So O
I O
upgraded O
the O
OS O
to O
Ubuntu O
12 O
. O
10 O
from O
within O
12 O
. O
04 O
. O

Not O
enough O
RAM O
definitely O
was O
the O
bottle O
neck O
in O
my O
laptop O
. O

Inputs O
and O
outputs O
are O
adequate O
for O
what O
this O
gadget O
is O
. O

FUNCTIONAL O
AND O
LIGHTWEIGHT O
. O

I O
was O
about O
to O
spend O
over O
$ O
50 O
to O
get O
a O
second O
hub O
for O
work O
. O

good O
microphone O
too O
. O

yr O
warranty O
. O

Pretty O
good O
for O
the O
price O
. O

The O
way O
to O
go O
, O
IMO O
and O
so O
stated O
, O
is O
continuous O
power O
as O
peak O
power O
ratings O
are O
all O
too O
often O
pure O
sales O
hype O
and O
do O
n't O
deliver O
the O
goods O
! O

This O
was O
compatible O
with O
our O
laptop O
, O
but O
only O
held O
about O
an O
hour O
charge O
. O

I O
called O
1 O
- O
800-SAMSUNG O
, O
gave O
them O
my O
ticket O
numbers O
, O
and O
requested O
that O
they O
advance O
- O
exchange O
the O
laptop O
: O
send O
me O
a O
new O
one O

DOES O
NOT O
RUN O
WINDOWS O
... O

I O
have O
dual O
1600 O
x O
1200 O
2007FP O
monitors O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
Surface O
Pro O
2 O
. O

I O
later O
recouped O
most O
of O
the O
profit O
selling O
to O
a O
friend O
who O
did O
n't O
mind O
booting O
linux O
from O
an O
sd O
card O
. O

I O
love O
the O
cut O
off O
on O
the O
bottom O
to O
perserve O
the O
battery O
. O

I O
've O
even O
packed O
it O
lopsided O
and O
had O
some O
of O
the O
flaps O
hanging O
open O
, O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
tip O
. O

It O
does O
what O
I O
want O
it O
to O
do O
, O
hooks O
my O
Mac O
Mini O
DVI O
to O
my O
monitor O
or O
TV O
screen O
. O

It O
is O
adequate O
for O
the O
500mA O
current O
rating O
of O
older O
USB1 O
and O
USB2 O
connections O
but O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
using O
these O
adapters O
to O
charge O
modern O
smartphones O
, O
tablets O
, O
etc O
. O
from O
newer O
computers O
or O
power O
bricks O
that O
can O
provide O
2000mA O
or O
more O
. O

The O
lag O
should O
n't O
be O
such O
a O
big O
deal O
for O
watching O
videos O
streamed O
from O
your O
laptop O
to O
your O
TV O
-- O
ideally O
the O
core O
scenario O
this O
device O
was O
made O
for O
. O

They O
look O
great O

to O
combine O

with O

hungry).Note O
that O
this O
will O
work O
with O
devices O
that O
do O
n't O
support O

, O
because O
it O
handles O
wireless O

at O
most O
) O
depending O
on O
the O

model O

I O
needed O

been O
using O
it O
for O
two O
months O
now O
and O
been O
working O
great O

I O
guess O
that O
s O
why O
it O
was O
free O
and O
came O
with O
it O

I O
keep O
the O
battery O
cover O
off O
so O
that O
I O
can O
roll O
them O
around O
at O
any O
time O
. O

The O
manual O
for O
the O
camcorder O
and O
software O
covers O
very O
little O
of O
camera O
use O
. O

They O
probably O
should O
have O
used O
the O
buttons O
that O
extend O
out O
further O
when O
in O
" O
OFF O

position O
and O
stay O
pressed O

For O
a O
friend O
whose O
old O
PC O
broke O
down O
, O
this O
is O
a O
serviceable O
replacement O
. O

Work O
perfectly O
with O
my O
Acer O
Laptop O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
need O
any O
other O
drivers O
. O

Just O
like O
this O
thing O
its O
works O
as O
they O
say O
and O
it O
works O
so O
good O
with O
my O
tablet O
.... O
give O
this O
as O
a O
gift O

The O
shoulder O

are O
a O

fit O

well O
while O
in O
use O

Great O

All O
in O
all O
, O
a O
decent O
product O
. O

In O
my O
case O
, O
I O
needed O
to O
connect O
a O
Canon O
XH O
- O
A1 O
HD O
video O
camera O
to O
my O
Win7 O
laptop O
. O

The O
fan O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
left O
corner O
of O
the O
Latitude O
. O

i O
love O
this O
case O
and O
am O
glad O
i O
spent O
the O
money O
on O
it O
to O
protect O
my O
macbook O
air O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
it O
was O
the O
supply O
and O
not O
the O
jack O
or O
anything O
inside O
the O
laptop O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
when O
I O
received O
the O
unit O
. O

Basically O
, O
I O
'm O
using O
just O
about O
every O
feature O
this O
dock O
can O
offer O
! O

It O
is O
a O
very O
attractive O
bag O
and O
has O
all O
the O
features O
and O
qualities O
you O
come O
to O
expect O
from O
Swiss O
Army O
backpacks O
. O

I O
used O
and O
loved O
canon O
products O
from O
the O
days O
that O
they O
had O
the O
solid O
metal O
Elf O
cameras O
( O
still O
have O
it O
) O
. O

So O
now O
I O
'm O
really O
convinced O
that O
this O
is O
n't O
regularly O
supposed O
to O
be O

like O
the O

All O
that O

necessary O
was O
to O

FYI O
, O
no O

The O
LCD O
quality O
is O
outstanding O
( O
a O
definite O
deal O
maker O
for O
me O
, O
because O
I O
needed O
a O
portable O
for O

) O
; O
the O
keyboard O
is O
the O
best O
I O
've O
ever O
used O
on O
a O
laptop O
, O
very O
comfortable O
, O
spacious O
and O
not O
spongy O
at O
all O
; O
sound O
quality O
is O
better O
than O
expected O
for O
a O

. O

i O
loved O
the O
fact O
of O
having O
a O
6 O
ft O
cable O
that O
could O
charge O
my O
phone O
but O
the O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
micro O
part O
. O

The O
' O
remote O
' O
button O
is O
convenient O
enough O
that O
it O
's O
easier O
to O
just O
lift O
my O

up O

click O
than O
it O
is O
to O
remember O

not O

much O
as O
to O

. O

I O
disabled O
the O

Moving O

annoying O
at O

This O
allows O
you O
to O
upgrade O
any O

, O
and O
to O
give O
it O
a O
nice O
deep O
clean O
. O

Both O
do O
the O
job O
, O
but O
the O
IOGear O
is O

This O
thing O
does O
the O
job O

I O
leave O
in O
San O
Francisco O
and O
when O
the O
Eagle O
people O
brought O
the O
unit O
up O
to O
the O
second O

, O
they O
damaged O
the O
box O
a O
bit O
( O
they O
made O
a O

) O
. O

I O
'll O

I O
want O

I O

a O

directly O
from O

I O
think O
my O
only O
complaint O
about O
this O

is O
that O
the O
menus O
are O
a O
little O
unintuitive O
to O
navigate O

No O
more O

the O
internal O
parts O
of O
this O
machine O
were O
built O
to O
last O
for O
many O
years O
. O

I O
imagine O
its O
clear O
sound O
is O
great O
for O

too O
. O

Plugged O
it O

Even O

I O
can O

I O
use O

( O

it O

it O

I O
purchased O
this O
item O
because O
the O

the O
came O
with O
my O

stopped O
working O
correctly O
. O

This O
is O
an O
inexpensive O
speaker O
system O
compared O
to O
others O
on O
the O
market O
but O
the O
sound O
quality O
is O
not O
on O

you O
get O

you O
pay O

. O

Browser&#34;. O
Browsing O
is O
the O
only O

you O

do O
if O
you O
live O

And O
yes O
, O
gaming O
is O
simply O
phenomenal O
on O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
have O
it O
installed O
on O
my O
Lenovo O
X230 O
and O
works O
at O
best O
30 O

So O
I O
told O

to O
just O
put O

Installed O
but O
found O
one O
dead O

The O
reverse O
pattern O
is O
great O
too O
which O
was O
a O
plus O
when O
the O
other O
side O
got O
dirty O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
leave O
my O
laptop O
on O
plugged O
in O
for O
most O
of O
the O
day O
, O
so O
I O
could O
be O
messing O
with O
the O
battery O
life O
. O

Each O
end O
seems O
to O
be O
to O
specification O
- O
fits O
everything O
it O
should O
. O

But O
my O
expectations O
were O
fully O
met O
and O
exceeded O
by O
this O
cable O
. O

Now O
, O
on O
the O
Apple O

I O
read O
that O
these O
are O
TYPICAL O
DEFECTS O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

It O
feels O
the O
same O
in O

as O
it O
does O
in O
Windows O

, O
so O

No O
more O
long O
wire O
getting O
caught O
underneath O
the O

. O

Compare O
that O
with O
our O
3 O

old O

that O
has O
survived O
drop O
after O
drop O
and O
still O
works O
great O
even O
with O
a O
cracked O

shattered O
screen O
. O

However O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
set O
up O
, O
and O
my O
family O
loves O
it O
. O

The O

but O
great O

Because O
of O
the O
ice O
storm O
in O
Atlanta O
during O
which O
I O
was O
trapped O
in O
my O
car O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
of O
time O
, O
I O
purchased O
two O
of O
these O
in O
February O
, O
one O
for O
each O
car O
. O

I O
just O
liked O
the O
specs O
at O
the O
time O
. O

What O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
is O
that O
in O
order O
to O
connect O
this O
unit O
to O
the O
internet O
, O
you O
need O
to O
have O
an O
ethernet O
cable O
, O
no O
wireless O
. O

This O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
flimsiness O
of O
the O
HDMI O
plug O
ends O
( O
the O
gold O
part O
) O
. O

It O
went O
in O
without O
any O
trouble O
and O
holds O
a O
charge O
well O
. O

It O
's O
just O
as O
good O
as O
listening O
from O
my O

. O

It O
's O
a O
perfect O
Tiffany O

blue O
( O
my O

) O

I O
would O
purchase O

There O
is O
not O
a O
way O
to O
hook O
the O

up O
to O

at O

, O
and O
sometimes O
you O
have O

rather O
than O
wireless O

. O

Nice O

. O

Love O
everything O
about O
this O

. O

this O
is O
the O
most O
powerful O
and O
the O
most O
expensive O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
purchased O
. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
very O
nice O
mouse O
for O
a O
very O
nice O
price O
! O

Subsequent O
research O
on O
the O
internet O
leads O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
a O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
, O
not O
the O
battery O
. O

Very O
useful O
& O
well O
made O
product O
but O
not O
as O
much O
reserve O
as O
the O
APC O
equivalent O

Please O
do O
that O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
have O
a O
system O
backup O
done O
first O
before O
you O
try O
that O
and O
a O
rescue O

I O

far O
as O
I O
've O
been O

to O
find O

is O
NOT O

with O
a O

. O

Every O
the O
cable O

are O
cheaply O
made O
and O
weaken O
rapidly O

I O
know O
how O
to O
squeeze O
more O

from O
these O
products O
. O

iPad O
is O
no O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
I O
still O
ca O
n't O
stand O
editing O
or O
delivering O
images O
from O
the O
iPad O
as O
I O
still O
find O
it O
too O
limiting O
. O

I O
received O
the O
case O
in O
less O
than O
a O
week O
. O

This O
is O
an O
excellent O
value O
. O

This O
battery O
is O
okay O
for O
the O
price O
, O
but O
its O
charge O
will O
rapidly O
reduce O
over O
time O
. O

I O
considered O
buying O
a O
Dell O
brand O
battery O
, O
but O
that O
battery O
cost O
as O
much O
as O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
whole O
laptop O
, O
so O
I O
went O
without O
the O
battery O
for O
a O
year O
or O
two O
. O

Very O
good O
product O
, O
as O
expected O
. O

It O
's O
relatively O
inexpensive O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
like O
it O
's O
good O
quality O
( O
with O
nicely O
molded O
ends O
) O
, O
and O
of O
course O
, O
it O
works O
perfectly O
. O

Once O
these O
items O
were O
invaluable O
for O
me O
to O
do O
my O
job O
at O
work O
every O
day O
. O

The O
sound O
quality O
and O
connectivity O
are O
a O
little O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
Monster O
ClarityHD O
that O
I O
have O
but O
that O
unit O
would O
allow O

from O

It O

For O
my O
initial O
two O
charges O
: O
I O
fully O
charged O
the O
battery O
and O
then O
disconnected O
the O
laptop O
from O
the O
AC O
power O
source O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
no O
complaints O
, O
highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
have O
used O
privacy O
screens O
across O
laptops O
and O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
different O
ways O
of O
wanting O
to O
attach O
to O
the O
laptop O
itself O
. O

The O
stand O
besides O
it O
is O
very O
usefull O
since O
it O
gives O
free O
motion O
to O
the O
TV O
( O
left O
and O
right O
about O
30 O
degress).UPdate O
: O
4 O
years O
after O
. O

Initially O
, O
I O
tested O
the O
stylus O
with O
the O
Super O
Note O
application O
for O
my O
ASUS O
eePad O

Brittle O
plastic O
. O

It O
was O
recommended O
that O
I O
call O
the O
manufacturer O
of O
my O
router O
, O
which O
I O
've O
had O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
never O
had O
a O
single O
issue O
with O
, O
ever O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
new O
one O
, O
and O
an O
antenna O
as O
the O
old O
one O
was O
broken O
in O
half O
after O
a O
fall O
off O
a O
fence O
. O

It O
has O
nice O
heft O
to O
it O
which O
I O
like O
of O
most O
of O
my O
electronics O
and O
feels O
like O
a O
good O
quality O
piece O
. O

After O
upgrading O
my O
wireless O
system O
from O
G O
to O
N O
, O
I O
needed O
to O
purchase O
new O
wireless O
adapters O
for O
our O
computers O
in O
our O
house O
, O
so O
I O
have O
bought O
three O
of O
these O
. O

My O
first O
FM O
transmitter O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
more O
than O
satisfied O
! O

so O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
my O
laptop O
. O

It O
comes O
in O
a O
clean O
, O
sleek O
white O
box O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
open O
. O

The O
Lenovo O
made O
the O
most O
sense O
for O
me O
as O
a O
companion O
device O
and O
it O
's O
truly O
an O
awesome O
device O
. O

You O
can O
go O
to O
the O
HP O
Spec O
Page O
and O
read O
all O
the O
specs O
, O
so O
my O
review O
is O
about O
my O
impressions O
. O

I O
love O
this O
camera O
bag O
. O

The O
best O
parts O
are O
that O
it O
is O
USB O
3 O
. O
0 O
, O
the O
case O
is O
aluminum O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
protective O
case O
. O

I O
still O
ca O
n't O
tap O
in O
the O
right O
spot O
without O
a O
stylus O
, O
but O
the O
little O
crosshair O
is O
quite O
amusing O
. O

This O
router O
was O
a O
disaster O
from O
the O
get O
go O
. O

Well O
first O
of O
all O
, O
this O
thing O
is O
really O
small O
, O
definitely O
not O
going O
to O
cause O
wire O
- O
routing O
issues O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
. O

I O
guess O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
rest O
the O
netbook O
in O
the O
zipped O
open O
case O
? O

The O
backlighting O
is O
only O
bright O
on O
the O
right O
side O
. O

Run O
away O
! O

Even O
without O
the O
HT O
, O
this O
little O
laptop O
performs O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
Atom O
netbook O
. O

This O
bag O
is O
not O
made O
of O
hard O
material O
. O

This O
product O
arrived O
on O
time O
and O
in O
perfect O
condition O
. O

Bottom O
line O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
. O

This O
little O
unit O
has O
four O
buttons O
on O
the O
top O
that O
include O
power O
, O
Bluetooth O
, O
Volume- O
, O
and O
Volume+ O
. O

I O
've O
had O
this O
TV O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
( O
bought O
it O
from O
Amazon O
, O
who O
had O
it O
to O
my O
house O
in O
less O
than O
48 O
hours O
... O

Heads O
up O
that O
most O
old O
TV O
sets O
have O
quite O
low O
resolutions O
. O

This O
problem O
is O
infrequent O
, O
and O
easily O
rectified O
by O
just O
wiggling O
the O
connector O
slightly O

Picture O

it O
to O
watch O
NetFlix O
movies O
) O
, O
Automatic O
detection O
of O
components O
, O
Very O
Large O
Viewing O
AngleCONS O

I O
found O
it O
intuitive O
operation O
wise O
. O

In O
urban O
areas O
all O
the O
pre O
- O
sets O
may O
be O
taken O
. O

I O
do O
own O
other O
portable O
radios O
however O
, O
including O
a O
Sangean O
and O
a O
Crane O
. O

The O
product O
itself O
is O
good O
:) O

The O
cable O
works O
fine O
, O
but O
the O
end O
that O
fits O
into O
the O
tablet O
does O
n't O
really O
connect O
in O
as O
snugly O
as O
the O
charging O
or O
computer O
cables O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

Network O
and O
Internet O
setup O
was O
a O
snap O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
require O
much O
more O
beyond O
adding O
it O
to O
our O
Firewall O
's O
' O
good O
guy O
' O
list O
. O

This O
thing O
rocks O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
shoulder O
strap O
started O
to O
separate O
after O
my O
first O
trip O
with O
the O
bag O
. O

Seriously O
- O
a O
Smurf O
would O
have O
trouble O
using O
this O
thing O
! O

The O
design O
is O
perfectly O
executed O
. O

It O
will O
primarily O
be O
used O
for O
writing O
and O
light O
data O
analysis O
in O
Excel O
or O
InfoPath O
. O

The O
case O
snaps O
on O
nicely O
via O
the O
ever O
- O
so O
- O
slightly O
overlapping O
tabs O
spaced O
around O
the O
top O
and O
bottom O
( O
the O
top O
and O
bottom O
case O
halves O
are O
separate O
) O
. O

We O
ended O
up O
buying O
a O
new O
hair O
dryer O
, O
curling O
iron O
, O
and O
electric O
toothbrush O
, O
which O
we O
left O
over O
there O
since O
we O
will O
probably O
never O
use O
them O
again O
. O

Sorry O
about O
Logitech O
's O
software O
issues O
with O
MS O
XT O
and O
Win7 O
. O

Fits O
perfect O
and O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
with O
vision O
difficulties O
, O
it O
is O
the O
perfect O
accessory O
for O
my O
camera O
. O

Games O
are O
allot O
of O
fun O
on O
it O
also O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
fingerprint O
- O
magnet O
. O

My O
laptop O
has O
a O
20 O
inch O
screen O
and O
this O
cooler O
works O
perfect O
. O

Fantastic O
buy O
for O
the O
price O
. O

Yup O
, O
it O
's O
the O
mother O
board O
, O
$ O
500 O
to O
fix O
, O
and O
wait O
a O
second O
. O

It O
also O
keeps O
my O
legs O
cool O
when O
used O
on O
my O
lap O
. O

There O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
few O
known O
issues O
( O

One O
contains O
my O
Canon O
Elph O
( O
digital O
point O
- O
and O
- O
shoot O
) O
. O

Had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

It O
is O
ideal O
for O
traveling O

Plug O
and O
play O
operation O
on O
windows O
7 O
and O
it O
works O
great O
for O
connecting O
a O
bluetooth O
keyboard O
. O

I O
really O
enjoy O
it O
for O
the O
great O
combination O
between O
software O
and O
hardware O
. O

It O
is O
look O
very O
nice O
and O
it O
really O
works O
! O
! O

I O
was O
concerned O
about O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
the O
native O
WiFi O
on O
the O
laptop O
, O
since O
I O
want O
to O
use O
the O
QQ O
Tech O
device O
only O
when O
the O
laptop O
does O
not O
connect O
. O

They O
work O
great O
and O
do O
n't O
rip O
off O
people O
like O
apple O
. O

So O
if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
portability O
, O
keep O
going O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
what O
you O
want O
. O

I O
would O
purchase O
more O
if O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

It O
ignores O
all O
remaining O
partitions O
. O

So O
far O
it O
has O
not O
failed O
the O
few O
times O
I O
've O
used O
it O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
uploading O
pictures O
of O
my O
bag O
so O
check O
them O
out O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
of O
this O
unit O
is O
video O
playback O
capability O
. O

Lightweight O
, O
decent O
battery O
life O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
inexpensive O
. O

The O
design O
is O
also O
quite O
impressive O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
it O
works O
great O

if O
it O
was O
not O
for O
that O
i O
would O
have O
given O
it O
5 O
stars O
. O

it O
has O
wonderful O
sound O
. O

should O
it O
fail O
at O
some O
point O
: O
they O
'll O
replace O
it O
if O
that O
happens O
. O

> O
Image O
quality O
seemed O
to O
get O
higher O
praises O
from O
reviews O
than O
the O
Panasonic O
m43 O
cameras O
. O

Excellent O
cloths O
. O

Very O
little O
bloatware O
( O
in O
fact O
nothing O
I O
have O
felt O
compelled O
to O
uninstall O
except O
the O
TrendMicro O
Internet O
app O
as O
I O
already O
employ O
Norton O
360).I'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
windows O

You O
can O
wear O
these O
all O
day O
. O

Great O
price O
( O
it O
was O
$ O
1499 O
when O
i O
bought O
it O
) O

It O
sounds O
really O
good O
for O
it O
's O
size O
, O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
about O
the O
most O
important O
aspect O
of O
a O
speaker O
. O

Much O
of O
that O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
hardware O
architecture O
and O
the O
OS O
, O
which O
are O
far O
superior O
to O
Win7 O
devices O
. O

But O
if O
you O
flip O
a O
small O
switch O
on O
the O
card O
, O
it O
will O
advertise O
itself O
like O
a O
WiFi O
hotspot O
. O

What O
a O
great O
idea O
and O
what O
a O
wonderful O
remote O
control O
for O
my O
iPhone O
and O
my O
iPad O
and O
as O
a O
remote O
shutter O
for O
my O
cameras O
that O
are O
built O
- O
in O
to O
my O
Apple O
devices O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
because O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
tons O
of O
room O
, O
but O
I O
find O
myself O
wrestling O
with O
it O
just O
to O
fit O
my O
laptop O
. O

I O
use O
this O
to O
connect O
my O
MP3 O
player O
or O
computer O
to O
my O
stereo O
, O
and O
the O
extra O
length O
allows O
some O
forgiveness O
if O
you O
catch O
it O
with O
your O
feet O
. O

Since O
the O
QNS-113 O
is O
classified O
as O
a O
' O
sleeve O
, O
' O
be O
aware O
that O
there O
are O
no O
additional O
pockets O
or O
compartments O
, O
inside O
or O
out O
, O
so O
you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
any O
accessories O
or O
a O
power O
brick O
with O
you O
. O

It O
's O
trying O
to O
do O
lots O
of O
things O
, O
USB O
, O
video O
transmission O
... O
but O
does O
n't O
really O
pull O
it O
off O
well O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
I O
spent O
the O
money O
and O
upgraded O
with O
this O
product O
. O

The O
design O
on O
this O
is O
great O
. O

It O
is O
light O
( O
2 O
. O
31 O
pounds O
) O
, O
it O
has O
a O
good O
keyboard O
, O
and O
it O
is O
specifically O
designed O
to O
work O
well O
with O
Google O
stuff O
. O

Only O

If O
I O
lower O
brightness O
to O
the O
lowest O
setting O
I O
can O
squeeze O
out O
close O
to O
6 O
hours O
I O
think O
, O
which O
for O
this O
size O
of O
computer O
and O
its O
power O
, O
is O
amazing O
! O

very O
good O
replacement O
at O
a O
reasonable O
cost O
, O
also O
it O
does O
have O
a O
nice O
quality O
to O
it- O
in O
that O

Um O
, O
it O
's O
a O
sleeve O
; O
if O
you O
want O
additional O
room O
to O
hold O
other O
items O
, O
get O
a O
case O
or O
bag O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
pc O
2 O
years O
ago O
, O
in O
those O
2 O
years O
I O
have O
replaced O
1 O
motherboard O
( O
could O
not O
get O
an O
oem O
from O
hp O
had O
to O
hunt O
down O
one O
that O
would O
work O
which O
means O
low O
and O
behold O

does O
it O
mention O
the O
base O
pads O
as O
covering O
the O
screws O
. O

Anker O
emailed O
me O
again O
. O

I O
am O
a O
fan O
of O
Logitech O
mice O
simply O
because O
of O
their O
quality O
, O
durability O
, O
and O
functionality O
. O

It O
is O
about O
1/3 O
the O
price O
of O
retail O
stores O
. O

Ever O
noticed O
that O
you O
have O
to O
search O
for O
outlets O
in O
a O
hotel O
room O
? O

First O
of O
all O
I O
'll O
note O
that O
the O
design O
here O
has O
promise O
, O
it O
is O
only O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
parts O
that O
is O
lacking O
. O

It O
does O
not O
have O
a O
microphone O
as O
some O
reviewers O
have O
stated O
. O

alright O
, O
I O
suffered O
a O
personal O
tragedy O
recently O
as O
my O
old O
macbook O
pro O
bit O
the O
dust O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
length O
for O
keeping O
by O
the O
bed O
because O
I O
can O
look O
at O
my O
tablet O
while O
it O
is O
plugged O
into O
the O
charger O
behind O
the O
nightstand O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
it O
's O
a O
neat O
toy O
you O
can O
play O
records O
on O
. O

You O
can O
take O
the O
dividers O
out O
and O
put O
whatever O
you O
want O
in O
them O
, O
but O
they O
really O
only O
work O
well O
with O
camera O
gear O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
that O
the O
cable O
is O
a O
few O
feet O
shorter O
, O
so O
you O
'll O
be O
tethered O
a O
little O
closer O
than O
you O
're O
used O
to O
. O

Bargain O
really O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
Fan O
- O
a O
- O
Techs O
what O
to O
do O
and O
their O
only O
advice O
was O
to O
shut O
it O
off O
. O

Video O
card O
is O
decent O
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
a O
gaming O
machine O
and O
for O
the O
price O
it O
quite O
good O
. O

The O
keyboard O
itself O
feels O
the O
same O
as O
the O
original O
. O

Made O
of O
hard O
steel O
hinges O
, O
and O
holds O
tight O
with O
metal O
screws O
on O
the O
mounting O
bracket O
to O
the O
windshield O
device O
that O
holds O
superbly O
. O

It O
has O
enough O
grip O
on O
the O
outside O
so O
it O
wo O
n't O
slip O
out O
of O
her O
hands O
. O

It O
would O
be O
way O
better O
if O
both O
ends O
were O
right O
angle O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
install O
this O
tuner O
on O
a O
XP O
MCE O
laptop O
and O
Vista O
32bit O
desktop O
and O
neither O
worked O
. O

so O
I O
will O
be O
returning O
them O
both O
before O
the O
other O
breaks O
as O
well O
. O

The O
device O
is O
simple O
enough O
and O
works O
as O
advertised O
. O

I O
like O
classic O
rock O
and O
mo O
- O
town O
music O

The O
glossiness O
factor O
is O
overdone O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
machine O
. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
extra O
pocket O
that O
in O
the O
description O
it O
says O
it O
fits O
a O
small O
paper O
folder O
... O

Nice O
buildgood O
grip O
in O
both O
usb O
and O
micro O
usb O
ends O
. O

It O
's O
very O
well O
designed O
and O
constructed O
- O
you O
can O
tell O
a O
lot O
of O
thought O
went O
into O
the O
design O
. O

This O
cover O
is O
great O
. O

, O
This O
is O
my O
first O
TV O
from O
Samsung O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
i O
do O
n't O
miss O
my O
old O
Sony O
one O
bit O
... O

One O
note O
... O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
this O
on O
a O
narrow O
shelf O
and O
use O
it O
as O
a O
tablet O
easel O
, O
it O
does O
have O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
large O
footprint O
. O

Making O
people O
think O
, O
" O
he O
must O
be O
doing O
some O
intense O
study O

when O
Amazon O
forwarded O
my O
review O
to O
these O
folks O
, O
they O
immediately O
reached O
out O
to O
me O
, O
offered O
suggestion O
for O
repairing O
the O
arrow O
keys O
( O
which O
had O
also O
ceased O
working O
) O
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
configuring O
this O
dock O
is O
a O
bit O
tricky O
and O
requires O
some O
trial O
- O
and O
- O
error O
and O
some O
patience O
. O

This O
battery O
was O
significantly O
cheaper O
than O
any O
others O
that O
I O
could O
find O
for O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
I O
was O
a O
little O
suspicious O
of O
it O
. O

Great O
product O
. O

I O
was O
sent O
this O
for O
review O
in O
exchange O
for O
my O
honest O
opinion O
. O

For O
it O
's O
looks O
I O
give O
it O
a O
