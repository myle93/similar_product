I O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
i O
would O
say O
im O
pretty O
satisfied O
. O

Additional O
caveat O
: O
the O
base B-AS
installation I-AS
comes O
with O
some O
Toshiba O
- O
specific O
software B-AS
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
to O
a O
user O
's O
liking O
. O

it O
is O
of O
high O
quality B-AS
, O
has O
a O
killer O
GUI B-AS
, O
is O
extremely O
stable O
, O
is O
highly O
expandable O
, O
is O
bundled O
with O
lots O
of O
very O
good O
applications B-AS
, O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
gets O
smeary O
and O
dusty O
very O
quickly O
and O
it O
's O
very O
noticeable O
. O

I O
previously O
owned O
an O
HP O
desktop O
and O
a O
Dell O
laptop O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
the O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
with O
all O
of O
the O
power B-AS
and O
ease B-AS
of O
the O
Mac O
! O

The O
internet B-AS
speed I-AS
is O
spectacular O
. O

Looking O
online O
, O
many O
people O
are O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

The O
resolution B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
screen I-AS
is O
almost O
pure O
HD O
. O

Acer O
was O
no O
help O
and O
Garmin O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
problem O
( O
after O
spending O
about O
2 O
hours O
with O
me O
) O
, O
so O
I O
returned O
it O
and O
purchased O
a O
Toshiba O
R700 O
that O
seems O
even O
nicer O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
load O
all O
of O
my O
software B-AS
with O
no O
problem O
. O

I O
got O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
. O

Overall O

Poor O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
computer O
worth O
the O
money O
; O

My O
son O
said O
it O
popped O
up O
and O
he O
clicked O
update O
. O

Another O
THREE O
weeks O
later O
I O
had O
my O
laptop O
back O
with O
a O
new O
mousepad B-AS
, O
keys B-AS
, O
and O
casing B-AS
. O

When O
I O
finally O
had O
everything O
running O
with O
all O
my O
software B-AS
installed O
I O
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O
and O
the O
system B-AS
crashed O
. O

It O
gets O
stuck O
all O
of O
the O
time O
you O
use B-AS
it O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
tapping O
on O
it O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work B-AS
. O

The O
`` O
Time O
remaining O
'' O
goes O
from O
4 O
hours O
plus O
to O
less O
than O
2 O
hours O
over O
the O
span O
of O
about O
10 O
minutes O
. O

After O
about O
another O
month O
I O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
AGAIN O
to O
Acer O
for O
repairs O
. O

That O
's O
right O
, O
no O
power O
, O
absolutely O
NOTHING O
. O

So O
honestly O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
expecting O
anything O
less O
than O
perfection O
, O
and O
I O
was O
n't O
disappointed O
. O

All O
the O
things O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad B-AS
make O
navigating B-AS
around O
the O
computer O
and O
its O
programs B-AS
so O
much O
simpler O
, O
quicker O
, O
and O
easier O
. O

- O
When O
I O
started O
worrying O
for O
not O
hearing O
anything O
from O
them O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
call O
. O

Worse O
, O
for O
the O
price B-AS
I O
could O
get O
a O
* O
netbook O
* O
that O
outperforms O
this O
machine O
. O

I O
made O
a O
photo O
book O
as O
a O
gift O
, O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
pushed O
`` O
Buy O
'' O
and O
it O
drew O
from O
my O
iTunes B-AS
account O
and O
sent O
the O
book O
to O
my O
house O
, O
the O
book O
was O
of O
perfect O
quality O
- O
exactly O
how O
I O
had O
created O
it O
and O
looked O
better O
than O
I O
had O
even O
imagined O
. O

Let O
's O
just O
get O
this O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
I O
love O
Apple O
! O

The O
screen B-AS
shows O
great O
colors B-AS
. O

they O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
motherboard B-AS
in O
April O

Couldnt O
not O
use O
it O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O
as O
I O
load B-AS
webpages B-AS
and O
applications B-AS
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price B-AS
for O
what O
I O
need O
it O
. O

One O
, O
owning O
a O
mac O
is O
essentially O
a O
full O
production O
studio O
( O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
mac O
book O
a O
portable O
version O
) O
. O

Strong O
performance B-AS
in O
this O
device O
makes O
use B-AS
of O
fun O
and O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
the O
era O
of O
speed B-AS
This O
device O
serves O
all O
modern O
requirements O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
game O
and O
is O
very O
useful O
for O
designers O
. O

I O
love O
this O
13 O
'' O
Mac O
white O
unibody O
. O

Simple O
to O
use B-AS
, O
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

Sad O
very O
SAD O
. O

I O
loaded O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
via O
Bootcamp B-AS
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
! O

Or O
the O
cursor B-AS
would O
show O
up O
some O
place O
else O
. O

It O
is O
so O
speedy O
. O

When O
the O
buyer O
returned O
it O
Wal O
Mart O
just O
boxed O
it O
, O
taped O
it O
shut O
resold O
it O
as O
new O
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
machine O
compared O
to O
the O
old O
MacBook O
is O
far O
superior O
. O

They O
claim O
call B-AS
center I-AS
is O
still O
down O
. O

Good O
bye O
BLUE O
SCREEN O
and O
Critical O
errors O
! O
! O
! O
! O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wont O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

Every O
driver B-AS
on O
the O
drivers B-AS
/ I-AS
applications I-AS
DVD I-AS
is O
everything O
you O
will O
need O
for O
a O
reload O
. O

Like O
the O
price B-AS
and O
operation B-AS
. O

It O
runs B-AS
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

99 O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

i O
give O
this O
laptop O
a O
five O
star O
review O
i O
love O
it O
and O
it O
has O
done O
chams O
for O
me O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
all O
other O
features B-AS
are O
a O
1 O

By O
this O
time O
I O
was O
regretting O
ever O
SEEING O
this O
machine O
on O
the O
shelf O
! O

I O
decided O
I O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
so O
I O
went O
into O
the O
BBY O
store O
. O

since O
then O
i O
have O
had O
minor O
problems O
with O
slow O
operation B-AS
. O

That O
included O
the O
extra O
Sony B-AS
Sonic I-AS
Stage I-AS
software I-AS
, O
the O
speakers B-AS
and O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
I O
got O
( O
that O
WAS O
worth O
the O
money O
) O
, O
the O
bluetooth B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
my O
supposedly O
bluetooth B-AS
enabled I-AS
computer O
, O
the O
extended B-AS
life I-AS
battery I-AS
and O
the O
Docking B-AS
port I-AS
. O

From O
the O
start O
, O
when O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
see O
a O
completely O
different O
class O
of O
machine O
. O

I O
got O
tired O
of O
buying O
laptops O
and O
having O
them O
stop O
working O
after O
a O
year O
. O

I O
love O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

Again O
in O
February O
my O
computer O
completely O
failed O
to O
the O
point O
that O
it O
could O
not O
load O
Windows B-AS
so O
I O
contacted O
Acer O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
thru O
my O
Warrenty B-AS
and O
it O
took O
about O
3 O
days O
fighting O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
agents B-AS
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
NONE O
of O
them O
spoke O
English O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
a O
AMD O
Semprom O
at O
2.1 O
ghz O
is O
a O
bummer O
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
HD O
or O
heavy O
computing B-AS
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
inspected O
the O
other O
netbooks O
and O
clearly O
their O
hinges B-AS
are O
tighter O
and O
I O
even O
demonstrate O
the O
difference O
between O
my O
netbook O
and O
others O
. O

Now O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
my O
monitor B-AS
has O
been O
acting O
up O
for O
about O
2 O
months O
. O

1st O
hand O
experience O
is O
very O
important O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
new O
customer O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
. O

My O
ONLY O
issues O
are O
: O
1 O
) O
the O
screen B-AS
/ I-AS
video I-AS
resolution I-AS
wo O
n't O
increase O
to O
a O
higher O
resolution B-AS
then O
1024 O
x O
60 O

I O
am O
first O
time O
Mac O
Buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features B-AS
and O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
the O
Mac O
offers O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
the O
performance B-AS
to O
price B-AS
ratio O
. O

We O
love O
the O
size B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
screen I-AS
, O
although O
it O
is O
still O
lightweight O
and O
very O
easy O
to O
tote B-AS
around O
. O

About O
2 O
months O
ago O
i O
bought O
the O
2011 O
macbook O
pro O
, O
which O
was O
an O
upgrade O
from O
my O
2010 O
macbook O
pro O
. O

Some O
features B-AS
arent O
friendly O
( O
volume B-AS
wheel I-AS
, O
sound B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

when O
i O
first O
got O
it O
i O
thought O
the O
size B-AS
of O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

The O
design B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
quality B-AS
is O
unprecedented O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
was O
shorter O
than O
expected O
. O

You O
better O
believe O
my O
next O
computer O
will O
be O
a O
MAC O
! O

Buy O
it O
, O
love O
it O
, O
and O
I O
promise O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
n't O
huge O
, O
but O
that O
does O
n't O
matter O
when O
I O
output O
media O
to O
the O
50 O
inch O
LCD O
TV O
. O

Almost O
4 O
years O
ago O
I O
bought O
what O
was O
then O
the O
current O
, O
up O
to O
date O
HP O
Pavilion- O
- O
If O
I O
recall O
correctly O
, O
it O
was O
the O
dv O
1300 O
t O
. O

You O
may O
need O
to O
special O
order O
a O
bag B-AS
. O

when O
i O
called O
to O
have O
another O
one O
shipped O
or O
to O
get O
my O
money O
back O
they O
said O
the O
return B-AS
policy I-AS
is O
23 O
twenty O
three O
days O
from O
the O
date O
of O
purchase O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
could O
ever O
live O
without O
my O
Qousmio O
. O

My O
husband O
uses O
it O
mostly O
for O
games B-AS
, O
email O
and O
music O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
eMachines O
can O
not O
be O
made O
entirely O
to O
blame O
for O
this O
computer O
's O
woes O
; O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
spend O
over O
$ O
100 O
on O
just O
a O
webcam B-AS
underscores O
the O
value B-AS
of O
this O
machine O
. O

The O
notebook O
is O
lacking O
a O
HDMI B-AS
port I-AS
and O
a O
S B-AS
- I-AS
video I-AS
port I-AS
that O
would O
enable O
one O
to O
hook O
it O
to O
a O
TV O
. O

I O
love O
it O
and O
the O
change O
in O
lifestyle O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

My O
opinion O
of O
Sony O
has O
been O
dropping O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
given O
their O
horrible O
support B-AS
, O
but O
this O
machine O
just O
caused O
another O
plunge O
. O

But O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
gotten O
mine O
right O
before O
they O
stopped O
making O
it O
. O

The O
service B-AS
tech I-AS
said O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
the O
damage O
and O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
recreate O
it O
therefore O
it O
had O
to O
be O
their O
defect O
. O

returned O
it O
to O
walmart O
. O

The O
port B-AS
is O
secured O
to O
motherboard B-AS
so O
when O
this O
happens O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
the O
plug B-AS
at O
all O
, O
it O
's O
just O
gone O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
, O
but O
if O
I O
could O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
get O
my O
money O
back O
, O
then O
I O
would O
. O

Returning O
this O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
out O
of O
work O

Three O
weeks O
after O
I O
bought O
the O
netbook O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
quit O
working O
. O

Satisfy O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
. O

When O
I O
got O
the O
computer O
back O
and O
realizwed O
it O
still O
was O
not O
correct O
HP O
told O
me O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
now O
it O
was O
my O
problem O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
this O
hp O
pc O
had O
been O
preciously O
sold O
by O
Wal O
Mart O
. O

It O
doesnt O
work B-AS
worth O
a O
damn O
. O

This O
system O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
or O
trouble O
trying O
to O
get O
it O
fix O
. O

I O
tell O
everyone O
I O
see O
out O
looking O
to O
get O
this O
or O
another O
Toshiba O
. O

- O
Stay O
away O
from O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
. O

The O
Notebook O
PC O
, O
Toshiba O
Qosmio O
is O
the O
best O
gift O
my O
father O
could O
have O
ever O
gotten O
me O
. O

Only O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
if O
you O
are O
using O
this O
for O
document B-AS
creation I-AS
Apple O
doesnt O
provide O
any O
kind O
of O
word B-AS
processor I-AS
( O
such O
as O
works O
for O
windows B-AS
) O
, O
but O
iwork B-AS
is O
cheap O
compared O
to O
office B-AS
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
all O
on O
this O
bad O
boy O
but O
the O
main O
thing O
this O
netbook O
was O
desinged O
for O
was O
surfing B-AS
the I-AS
web I-AS
and O
boy O
o O
boy O
does O
it O
ever O
. O

It O
has O
easy O
to O
use O
features B-AS
and O
all O
the O
speed B-AS
and O
power B-AS
I O
could O
ask O
for O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
operate B-AS
and O
I O
have O
already O
ordered O
more O
software B-AS
and O
gadgets B-AS
for O
my O
new O
Rolls O
Royce O
of O
laptops O
. O

I O
have O
recently O
converted O
back O
to O
a O
mac O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
! O

Oh O
and O
it O
has O
word B-AS
and O
stuff O
but O
its O
a O
trial O
verion O
so O
after O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
when O
you O
go O
to O
open O
it O
it O
asks O
for O
a O
product O
key O
which O
didnt O
come O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
even O
after O
clicking O
cancel O
it O
wont O
let O
you O
use O
it O
at O
all O
I O
use O
the O
old O
word B-AS
processer I-AS
which O
works O
good O
. O

I O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
the O
first O
month O
I O
got O
it O
. O

The O
Mac O
Book O
Pro O
performs O
flawlessly O
. O

I O
got O
the O
black O
MacBook O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
never O
regretted O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
blinks O
it O
shuts O
off O
at O
will O
. O

The O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
unit O
was O
unresolvable O
. O

although O
its O
windows B-AS
vista I-AS
compared O
to O
windows B-AS
xp I-AS
sucks O
. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
small O
, O
convenient O
size B-AS
of O
my O
laptop O
, O
making O
it O
a O
perfect O
tool O
for O
my O
academic O
studies O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
amazingly O
long O
at O
7hrs O
and O
5hrs O
if O
you O
use O
it O
. O

( O
Beware O
, O
their O
staff B-AS
could O
send O
you O
back O
making O
you O
feel O
that O
only O
they O
know O
what O
a O
computer O
is O
. O

They O
sent O
out O
a O
Sony B-AS
'Certified I-AS
' I-AS
technician I-AS
. O

Not O
too O
much O
`` O
junk O
'' O
software B-AS
to O
remove O
. O

Just O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
or O
two O
months O
ago O
, O
my O
VAIO O
crashed O
again O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
not O
go O
back O
to O
using O
a O
PC O
after O
using O
the O
mac O
. O

while O
it O
was O
barely O
a O
bargin O
in O
the O
begining O
, O
i O
would O
never O
purchase O
another O
dell O
and O
would O
not O
recomend O
the O
dell O
brand O
to O
others O
. O

Which O
I O
still O
use O
and O
have O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
TV O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
sucked O
the O
juice O
from O
my O
laptop O
and O
when O
the O
extended B-AS
life I-AS
battery I-AS
went O
out O
we O
were O
SOL O
there O
to O
, O
so O
much O
for O
that O
warranty B-AS
covering O
all O
the O
products O
we O
purchased O
. O

I O
regret O
buying O
it O
before O
understanding O
how O
awful O
it O
is O
to O
use B-AS
. O

The O
reflectiveness O
of O
the O
display B-AS
is O
only O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
work O
in O
a O
controlled O
- O
lighting O
environment O
like O
me O
( O
I O
prefer O
it O
dark O
) O
or O
if O
you O
can O
crank O
up O
the O
brightness B-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
prodcut O
to O
handle O
basic O
computing O
needs O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
computer O
purchase O

And O
that O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
ive O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
get O
fixed O
. O

Not O
enough O
time O
for O
me O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
! O

they O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O
. O

I O
will O
never O
complain O
about O
the O
price B-AS
since O
I O
believe O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
worth O
every O
dollar O
. O

Another O
issue O
I O
have O
with O
it O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
. O

I O
love O
my O
Apple O
, O
it O
is O
quick O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

Once O
I O
removed O
all O
the O
software B-AS
the O
laptop O
loads B-AS
in O
15 O
- O
20 O
seconds O
. O

Its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value B-AS
. O

My O
children O
wo O
n't O
even O
use O
it O
for O
their O
school O
work O
. O

I O
only O
used O
it O
to O
browse O
the O
internet O
and O
and O
I O
dont O
know O
how O
many O
times O
it O
has O
spontaniously O
shut O
down O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
blank O
screen O
now O
. O

Problem O
fixed O
which O
is O
great O
but O
there O
went O
another O
two O
weeks O
without O
my O
laptop O
at O
school O
. O

The O
Final B-AS
Cut I-AS
Pro I-AS
on O
this O
laptop O
is O
so O
fast O
and O
easy O
, O
and O
I O
can O
use O
this O
to O
seemlessly O
transfer O
all O
my O
work O
to O
my O
home O
computer O
, O
which O
is O
also O
a O
mac O
. O

Fan B-AS
vents O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
no O
cooling B-AS
pad I-AS
needed O
, O
great O
feature B-AS
! O

I O
got O
it O
back O
and O
my O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
webcam I-AS
and O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
mic I-AS
were O
shorting O
out O
anytime O
I O
touched O
the O
lid O
, O
( O
mind O
you O
this O
was O
my O
means O
of O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
who O
was O
deployed O
) O
but O
I O
suffered O
thru O
it O
and O
would O
constandly O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
computer O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
my O
cam B-AS
and O
mic B-AS
anytime O
they O
went O
out O
. O

Adjust O
the O
sensitivity B-AS
since O
it O
's O
not O
that O
responsive O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

He O
said O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
people O
had O
encountered O
this O
problem O
and O
said O
it O
is O
a O
common O
issue O
. O

I O
LOVE O
IT O
! O

It O
takes O
me O
approximately O
3 O
tries O
to O
get O
to O
each O
site O
, O
then O
after O
closing O
the O
browser B-AS
and O
reopening O
it O
it O
actually O
works O
. O

Winters O
is O
on O
it O
's O
way O
and O
I O
imagine O
it O
will O
be O
cozy O
. O

The O
benefits O
were O
immediate O
! O

All- O
in- O
all O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
nearly O
everyone O
. O

just O
chill O
and O
enjoy O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
family O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
financially O
because O
he O
is O
self- O
employed O
so O
the O
family O
had O
no O
computer O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
kyle O
the O
oldest O
child O
is O
12 O
and O
really O
need O
something O
to O
help O
him O
in O
school O
. O

This O
is O
what O
they O
told O
me O
: O
It O
heats O
up O
, O
and O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
no O
longer O
call O
them O
laptops O
, O
and O
simply O
categorize O
them O
as O
portables O
. O
