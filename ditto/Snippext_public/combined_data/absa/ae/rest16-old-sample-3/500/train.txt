As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

Reliable O
, O
Fresh O
Sushi B-AS

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
- O
- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
, O
present O
your O
meal O
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Went O
for O
Mom O
's O
birthday O
brunch/ O
lunch O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
very O
dissappointed O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

Run O
do O
n't O
walk O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-AS
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

Raga B-AS
's I-AS
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

Good O
drink B-AS
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

Mermaid B-AS
Inn I-AS
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-AS
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands- O
down O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Chicken B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
had O
tomato O
or O
pimentos O
on O
top O
? O
? O

Expensive O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-AS
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-AS
- I-AS
staff I-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
had O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

I O
was O
visiting O
New O
York O
City O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
discovered O
this O
really O
warm O
and O
inviting O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

we O
have O
been O
there O
3 O
times O
since O
last O
week O
we O
alked O
it O
by O
chance O
first O
day O
the O
manager O
offerd O
us O
the O
margherita O
pizza O
adn O
we O
said O
yes O
. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O
. O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

I O
'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
Rocks O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over O
- O
priced O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-AS
and O
non O
- O
existent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
' O

For O
me O
dishes B-AS
a O
little O
oily O
, O
but O
overall O
dining O
experience O
good O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Remind O
me O
of O
home O
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-AS

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Great O

, O
great O

. O

The O
food B-AS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
Thai B-AS
fusion I-AS
stuff I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
! O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
... O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
penne I-AS
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-AS
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

One O
of O
the O
BEST O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot O
, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O
here O
, O
it O
was O
very O
well O
organized O

We O

My O

Once O

for O
brunch O

Loved O
It O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B-AS
start O
at O
$ O
70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30+ O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-AS
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-AS
mix I-AS
( I-AS
special I-AS
) I-AS
, O
crab B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
assorted B-AS
sashimi I-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
and O
rolls B-AS
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-AS
, O
and O
the O
banana B-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
your O
money O
. O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant B-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O

Beautiful O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

The O
jukebox B-AS
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
. O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-AS
Saul I-AS
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice O
though O

the O

was O
imazingly O
cooked O
well O
and O

which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion O
... O
a O
bucket O

literally O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-AS
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
booths B-AS
allow O
you O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
eachother O
without O
looking O
like O
'that O
' O
couple O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds- O
- O
this O

in O
the O

of O
a O
million O

at O

9/ O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O

/ O
c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup O
) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-AS
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-AS
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

The O
place O
's O
decor B-AS
and O
hidden B-AS
bathrooms I-AS
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Skip O
Nathan O
's O
... O
you O
can O
get O
that O
at O
the O
mall O
... O
go O
to O
Bark O
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian B-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

Delivery B-AS
guy I-AS
sometimes O
get O
upset O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
tip O
more O
than O
10 O
% O
. O

The O
location B-AS
is O
perfect O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host O
, O
Vittorio B-AS
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
- O
- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O

did O
not O
stop O
to O

or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O

The O
food B-AS

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
wonderful O
; O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
new I-AS

city I-AS
skiline I-AS
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for O
... O

The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-AS
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

Always O
good O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
squid I-AS
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-AS
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O

a O
problem O
with O

save O
a O
missing O

once O
. O

The O

much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes O
, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
is O
n't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

$ O
500 O
included O
: O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-AS
amuse I-AS
bouche I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

I O
'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

Bukhara B-AS
Grill I-AS
, O
the O
tagline O
says O
it O
all.. O
`` O
INDIAN O
SPICE O
RAVE O
'' O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
adn O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
! O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-AS
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-AS
ribs I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

I O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
... O
) O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
entertainment O
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
too O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

Delivery B-AS
can O
be O
spot O
on O
or O
lacking O
depending O
on O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
day O
of O
the O
week O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

You O
'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary O
, O
birthday O
, O
valentines O
day O
... O

It O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

Best O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
menu I-AS
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-AS
and O
great O
service B-AS
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
`` O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
'' O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

Yamato B-AS
is O
an O
excellent O
place O
to O
go O
if O
youre O
not O
into O
sashimi O
, O
or O
if O
you O
have O
friends O
who O
doesnt O
like O
sushi O
much O
. O

A O
weakness O
is O
the O
chicken B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
salads I-AS
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao B-AS
's I-AS
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

Best O
restaurant B-AS
in O
Brooklyn O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-AS
( I-AS
rice I-AS
porridge I-AS
) I-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

The O
floor O
was O
wet O
, O
the O
trash O
can O
filled O
with O
hand O
towels O
n O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
, O
no O
soap O
, O
and O
no O
hand O
towels O
left O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

Gorgeous O
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-AS
, O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-AS
is O
fast O
. O

Nice O
view B-AS
of I-AS
river I-AS
and I-AS
NYC I-AS
. O

Great O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

The O
family B-AS
seafood I-AS
entree I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
was O
incredible O
last O
night O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-AS
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
`` O
I O
've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
'' O
. O

Food B-AS
- O
awesome O
. O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O
. O

Cute O
place B-AS
, O
nice O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

Calling O
the O
place B-AS
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-AS
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-AS
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
were O
juicy O
and O
tender O
inside O
and O
had O
plenty O
of O
crunch O
and O
snap O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-AS
- I-AS
private I-AS
boths I-AS
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
lie O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O
. O

Very O
pleased O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-AS
table I-AS
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-AS

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
- O
- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-AS
choices I-AS
. O

Good O
creative O
rolls B-AS
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

They O
're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Chinese I-AS
in O
the O
city O
, O
by O
far O
! O

I O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

The O
high O
prices O
you O
're O
going O
to O
pay O
is O
for O
the O
view B-AS
not O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-AS
like O
this O
. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-AS
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
... O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef B-AS
's I-AS
tasting I-AS

your O
favourite O

My O

also O
good O

- O
they O
did O

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O

The O

are O
very O
friendly O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami- O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste- O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

We O
thought O
the O
dessert B-AS
would O
be O
better O
, O
Wrong O
! O

This O
place B-AS
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
decor B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

please O
do O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

Fish B-AS
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
in O
new O

While O
their O
kitchen B-AS
food I-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Place B-AS
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O
dress O
code O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood B-AS

This O
was O

relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

we O
love O

You O
would O
think O

would O
make O

sadly O
, O
no O

Murray O

Great O
Atmosphere B-AS

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland B-AS
Brewery I-AS
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-AS
of I-AS
mirrors I-AS
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

Do O
n't O
miss O
Bloom B-AS
's I-AS
on O
your O
next O
trip O
to O
Manhatten O
. O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-AS
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

Big B-AS
Wong I-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
and O
fill O
your O
stomach O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

Excellent O
food B-AS
for O
great O
prices O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it O
; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu B-AS
- I-AS
Shabu I-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
Try O
- O
State O
Area O
. O

Not O
cheap O
but O
very O
yummy O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-AS
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

Great O
survice B-AS

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

The O
omlette B-AS
for I-AS
brunch I-AS
is O
great O
... O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

Helpful O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O

. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

The O
dishes B-AS
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-AS
sausages I-AS
, O
sardines B-AS
with I-AS
biscuits I-AS
, O
large B-AS
whole I-AS
shrimp I-AS
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-AS
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
. O

I O
've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O

Molto O
bene O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B-AS
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

I O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

The O
potato B-AS
balls I-AS
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-AS
and I-AS
Hydes I-AS
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

I O
love O
it O
. O

Guacamole+shrimp B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-AS
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-AS
. O

Chennai B-AS
Garden I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
good O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

NO O
PIZZA B-AS

for O
me O
! O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles O
. O

Service B-AS
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

fresh B-AS
restaurant I-AS
was O
amazing O
... O
... O
.. O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Poor O
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

Although O
the O
tables B-AS
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle B-AS
- I-AS
light I-AS
, O
food B-AS
- O
quality O
and O
service B-AS
overcompensate O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

Ingredients B-AS
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B-AS
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B-AS
is O
great O
: O
it O
's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

Service B-AS
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-AS
spot I-AS
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-AS
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

Rao B-AS
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing O
special O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
