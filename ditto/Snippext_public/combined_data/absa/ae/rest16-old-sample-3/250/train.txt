As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

Reliable O
, O
Fresh O
Sushi B-AS

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
- O
- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
, O
present O
your O
meal O
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Went O
for O
Mom O
's O
birthday O
brunch/ O
lunch O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
very O
dissappointed O
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

Run O
do O
n't O
walk O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-AS
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

Raga B-AS
's I-AS
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

Good O
drink B-AS
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

Mermaid B-AS
Inn I-AS
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-AS
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands- O
down O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Chicken B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
had O
tomato O
or O
pimentos O
on O
top O
? O
? O

Expensive O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-AS
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-AS
- I-AS
staff I-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
had O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

I O
was O
visiting O
New O
York O
City O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
discovered O
this O
really O
warm O
and O
inviting O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

we O
have O
been O
there O
3 O
times O
since O
last O
week O
we O
alked O
it O
by O
chance O
first O
day O
the O
manager O
offerd O
us O
the O
margherita O
pizza O
adn O
we O
said O
yes O
. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O
. O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

I O
'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
Rocks O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over O
- O
priced O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-AS
and O
non O
- O
existent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
' O

For O
me O
dishes B-AS
a O
little O
oily O
, O
but O
overall O
dining O
experience O
good O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Remind O
me O
of O
home O
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-AS

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Great O

, O
great O

. O

The O
food B-AS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
Thai B-AS
fusion I-AS
stuff I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
! O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
... O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
penne I-AS
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-AS
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

One O
of O
the O
BEST O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot O
, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O
here O
, O
it O
was O
very O
well O
organized O

We O

My O

Once O

for O
brunch O

Loved O
It O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B-AS
start O
at O
$ O
70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30+ O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-AS
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-AS
mix I-AS
( I-AS
special I-AS
) I-AS
, O
crab B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
assorted B-AS
sashimi I-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
and O
rolls B-AS
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-AS
, O
and O
the O
banana B-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
your O
money O
. O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant B-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O

Beautiful O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

The O
jukebox B-AS
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
. O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-AS
Saul I-AS
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice O
though O

the O

was O
imazingly O
cooked O
well O
and O

which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion O
... O
a O
bucket O

literally O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-AS
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
booths B-AS
allow O
you O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
eachother O
without O
looking O
like O
'that O
' O
couple O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds- O
- O
this O

in O
the O

of O
a O
million O

at O

9/ O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O

/ O
c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup O
) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-AS
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-AS
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

The O
place O
's O
decor B-AS
and O
hidden B-AS
bathrooms I-AS
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Skip O
Nathan O
's O
... O
you O
can O
get O
that O
at O
the O
mall O
... O
go O
to O
Bark O
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian B-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

Delivery B-AS
guy I-AS
sometimes O
get O
upset O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
tip O
more O
than O
10 O
% O
. O

The O
location B-AS
is O
perfect O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host O
, O
Vittorio B-AS
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
- O
- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O

did O
not O
stop O
to O

or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O

The O
food B-AS

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
wonderful O
; O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
new I-AS

city I-AS
skiline I-AS
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for O
... O

The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-AS
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

Always O
good O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
squid I-AS
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-AS
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O
