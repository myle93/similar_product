all O
the O

are O
necessary O
for O

if O
not O

so O
great O

I O
can O
Hardly O
ever O
take O
my O

off O
it O

( O
I O
definatly O
ca O

Ok O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
Apple O

But O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
is O
not O
available O
24 O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
anyone O
can O
use O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
impressed O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
even O
after O
paying O
staples O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
speed O
it O
up O

i O
love O
to O
use O
it O
it O

It O

big O

since O

what O

I O
would O
say O
if O

In O
the O
past O
four O
years O
I O
've O
had O
it O
I O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
. O

I O
Love O
my O
new O
computer O
! O

I O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
did O
think O
it O
had O
a O
camera B-AS
because O
that O
was O
one O
of O
my O
requirements O
, O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications B-AS
on O
this O
one O
before O
I O
purchased O
. O

But O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O
operation B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS

Thank O
God O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
've O
been O
using O
laptops O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
and O
probably O
the O
majority O
of O
brands O
out O
there O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Originally O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

Apparently O
well O
- O
built B-AS
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look B-AS
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price B-AS
and O
performance B-AS
. O

THIS O
IS O
MY O
SECOND O
MAC O
BOOK O
PRO O
. O

I O
got O
assurances O
from O
2 O
different O
people O
that O
the O
remaining O
10 O
months O
of O
my O
warranty B-AS
would O
transfer O
to O
the O
new O
computer O
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

This O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

Although O
my O
model O
was O
listed O
as O
recalled O
, O
HP O
denied O
my O
claim O
. O

An O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
. O

The O
price B-AS
premium I-AS
is O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features B-AS
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O
. O

Despite O
the O
claims O
of O
the O
Apple O
apologists O
( O
a O
vice O
of O
which O
I O
am O
recently O
myself O
reformed O
) O
the O
internals B-AS
of O
Mac O
laptops O
are O
NO O
different O
from O
PCs O
' O
at O
this O
point O
. O

Theres O
a O
built B-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
with O
special O
effects O
- O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
. O

And O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company B-AS
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
opened O
the O
box O
to O
the O
present O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
joy O
. O

It O
has O
happened O
again O
and O
I O
'm O
being O
told O
that O
it O
's O
$ O
175 O
. O

Again O
. O

I O
claim O
that O
this O
has O
no O
value O
to O
me O
, O
the O
laptop O
was O
new O
anyway O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
space B-AS
bar I-AS
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-AS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

But O
see O
the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
different O
because O
it O
may O
have O
a O
huge O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
but O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
full O
software B-AS
that O
you O
would O
actually O
need O
and O
most O
of O
it O
has O
free O
future O
updates B-AS
. O

Took O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
defective O
. O

also O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
compared O
to O
others O
. O

Maybe O
three O
or O
four O
months O
ago O
it O
started O
blinking O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
. O

Very O
very O
disappointed O
! O

It O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

Received O
all O
four O
in O
good O
order O
; O

They O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard B-AS
again O
, O
but O
Dell O

Again O
, O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
the O
right B-AS
speaker I-AS
did O
not O
work O
. O

All O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-AS
cd I-AS
's I-AS
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

I O
should O
have O
bought O
one O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

It O
started O
out O
getting O
hot O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
. O

By O
the O
way O
teachers O
, O
they O
offer O
a O
discount O
which O
helps O
! O

It O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
memory B-AS
and O
a O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

After O
years O
of O
using O
PCs O
, O
a O
new O
Mac O
user O
is O
basically O
forced O
to O
re- O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
a O
computer O
. O

It O
's O
the O
inside O
that O
is O
truly O
wonderful O
. O

Right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
I O
asked O
of O
it O
, O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you O
're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
( O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
) O
. O

Frustrated O
I O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2- O
3 O
days O
for O
turnaround O
time O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
as O
a O
problem O
. O

I O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
! O

It O
can O
not O
save O
the O
correct O
date O
and O
time O
I O
set O
. O

My O
problem O
was O
with O
DELL B-AS
Customer I-AS
Service I-AS
. O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O
desktop O
, O
and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O
, O
which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
or O
the O
motherboard B-AS
. O

They O
told O
me O
it O
was O
my O
loss O
even O
though O
it O
was O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
what O
I O
've O
done O
. O

Laptop O
is O
advertised O
as O
a O
15 B-AS
'' I-AS
but O
the O
casing B-AS
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a O
17 B-AS
'' I-AS
. O

It O
was O
always O
getting O
froze O
up O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
trying O
to O
decide O
on O
another O
Dell O
model O
. O

HOW O
DOES O
THE O
POWER B-AS
SUPPLY I-AS
NOT O
WORK O
! O
! O
! O

However O
the O
frozen O
screens B-AS
kept O
happening O
. O

Great O
OS B-AS
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor B-AS
speed I-AS
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt B-AS
port I-AS
. O

Clear O
picture B-AS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

I O
have O
never O
really O
been O
big O
on O
downloading O
anything O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
too O
worried O
about O
getting O
a O
virus O
, O
plus O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
protected O
by O
Norton B-AS
. O

It O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
, O
making O
transporting B-AS
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
. O

My O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
loaded I-AS
Norton I-AS
Firewall I-AS
/ I-AS
Security I-AS
program I-AS
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
buttons I-AS
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

I O
now O
own O
another O
Hewlitt O
Packard O
. O

They O
are O
n't O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
on O
the O
cheap O
side O
, O
laptop O
speaking O
. O

They O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
I O
return O
it O
within O
15 O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

Obviously O
we O
both O
got O
new O
Macs O
. O

Unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O
inconvenienced O
with O
a O
non O
working O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O
attachment O
so O
small O
. O

Supplied B-AS
software I-AS
: O
The O
software B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
this O
machine O
is O
greatly O
welcomed O
compared O
to O
what O
Windows B-AS
comes O
with O
. O

I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
Vista B-AS
, O
yet O
I O
know O
Vista B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
Acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
Vista B-AS
( O
I O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
) O
. O

We O
use O
the O
built B-AS
in I-AS
tools I-AS
often O
, O
iTunes B-AS
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iPhone O
. O

Took O
several O
hours O
with O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
before O
I O
could O
even O
start O
the O
PC O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

The O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty B-AS
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
recommend O
the O
HP O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrentys B-AS
. O

Would O
buy O
100 O
more O
of O
these O
if O
I O
could O
. O

Either O
way O
the O
entire O
thing O
was O
just O
a O
joke O
, O
a O
complete O
rip O
off O
! O

This O
laptop O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
little O
peice O
of O
machinery O
I O
have O
owned O
outside O
of O
the O
Iphone O
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
back O
in O
yet O
again O
except O
this O
time O
they O
kept O
it O
to O
send O
into O
their O
Geek O
Squad O
headquarters O
. O

It O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

I O
think O
I O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

They O
freeze O
all O
the O
time O
. O

My O
friends O
or O
children O
use O
that O
when O
they O
need O
to O
borrow O
the O
Net O
= O
) O
When O
I O
out O
grow O
this O
Meaning O
when O
its O
old O
and O
my O
oldest O
child O
is O
ready O
for O
one O
she O
will O
get O
this O
one O
ANd O
I O
will O
be O
buying O
only O
TOSHIBA O
! O

The O
ease O
in O
which O
you O
set O
everything O
up O
is O
such O
that O
a O
child O
could O
do O
it O
. O

Overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
I O
use O
. O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery B-AS
... O

Eventually O
my O
battery B-AS
would O
n't O
charge O
, O
so O
unless O
I O
had O
it O
plugged O
in O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
power O
on O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
more O
like O
week O
one O
. O

It O
was O
secure O
and O
easy O
to O
navigate B-AS
. O

If O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
my O
apple O
items O
I O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
one O
of O
my O
local O
stores O
and O
they O
work O
on O
correcting O
it O
right O
there O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
really O
happy O
that O
I O
waited O
to O
buy O
, O
because O
this O
thing O
kicks O
a O
$ O
$ O
! O

I O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery B-AS
once O
, O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O
laptop O
with O
semi O
- O
decent O
gaming B-AS
capabilities O
. O

It O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
with O
2 O
buttons O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
is O
better O
than O
the O
Toshiba O
, O
too O
. O

BUT O
there O
's O
this O
application B-AS
called O
Boot B-AS
Camp I-AS
which O
allows O
you O
to O
add O
another O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
like O
Windows B-AS
. O

, O
Applications B-AS
respond O
immediately O
( O
not O
like O
the O
tired O
MS B-AS
applications I-AS
) O
. O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
just O
pick O
up O
and O
use B-AS
- O
- O
It O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
get O

the O

OS I-AS

Lightweight O
and O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
beautiful O

It O
is O

Desktop O
Replacement O

No O

up I-AS
was O
terrific O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bad O
experience O
but O
i O
played O
down O
its O
importance O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
. O

Excellent O
LED B-AS
monitor I-AS
and O
well O
equipped O
. O

I O
eventually O
did O
the O
migration O
from O
my O
iMac B-AS
backup I-AS
disc I-AS
which O
uses O
USB B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
stuck O
w/ O
a O
broken O
computer O
. O

I O
do O
transcription O
work O
on O
the O
side O
, O
and O
the O
flatline B-AS
keyboard I-AS
makes O
typing O
quick O
and O
easy O
as O
well O
. O

Until O
I O
bought O
the O
Dell O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
( O
size B-AS
, O
software B-AS
, O
options O
, O
hardware B-AS
) O
and O
purchase O
the O
best O
deal O
you O
could O
find O
. O

but O
other O
then O
that O
I O
would O
give O
this O
product O
a O
4 O
in O
hafe O
stars O
. O

So O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
install O
one O
of O
the O
3 O
printers O
I O
have O
in O
my O
house O
so O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
print O
. O

Treat O
yourself O
to O
a O
more O
expensive O
, O
long O
- O
lasting O
laptop O
of O
quality B-AS
like O
a O
Sony O
, O
Apple O
, O
or O
Toshiba O
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

Could O
n't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
said O
, O
about O
10 O
% O
of O
their O
products O
fail O
. O

Then O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
failed O
; O

I O
could O
not O
find O
a O
phone O
number O
anywhere O
to O
call O
an O
actual O
live O
person O
for O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
and O
had O
to O
result O
the O
their O
online B-AS
chat I-AS
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
( O
Refurbished O
) O
again O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
and O
if O
the O
fancy O
webcam B-AS
breaks O
guess O
who O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
to O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
? O

She O
told O
me O
flatly O
, O
`` O
It O
's O
like O
that O
one O
. O

I O
guess O
he O
was O
the O
technical B-AS
person I-AS
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
, O
it O
's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
OS B-AS
of O
a O
Mac O
but O
I O
'm O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

Overall O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
perfect O
, O
great O
computer O
, O
my O
daughter O
loves O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

After O
3 O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
the O
laptop O
just O
died O
. O

HP O
said O
I O
had O
done O
the O
damage O
. O

This O
computer O
I O
used O
daily O
nice O
compact O
design B-AS
. O

i O
love O
the O
size B-AS
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O
games B-AS
on O
it O
. O

Worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
company O
nor O
the O
toshiba O
brand O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
because O
I O
've O
put O
more O
into O
it O
then O
it O
is O
worth O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard B-AS
. O

I O
dual O
boot O
with O
Linux B-AS
and O
that O
other O
security B-AS
- I-AS
prone I-AS
OS I-AS
and O
it O
performs B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

taking O
it O
back O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
of O
purchase O

I O
also O
purchased O
Office B-AS
Max I-AS
's I-AS
`` I-AS
Max I-AS
Assurance I-AS
'' I-AS
with O
the O
`` O
no O
lemon O
'' O
clause O
. O

A O
cheaper O
price B-AS
should O
not O
equal O
a O
`` O
cheap O
'' O
product O
. O

I O
did O
contact O
HP O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
I O
am O
. O

the O
internet O
can O
be O
an O
scary O
place O
its O
up O
to O
you O
on O
what O
you O
do O
with O
it O
. O

This O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
is O
great O
! O

It O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam B-AS
, O
and O
Skype B-AS
works O
very O
well O
. O

I O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
this O
product O
can O
not O
display O
websites O
that O
contain O
Flash O
. O

( O
The O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
is O
the O
motherboard B-AS
chip I-AS
that O
lets O
the O
CPU B-AS
talk O
to O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O
) O

I O
edit O
and O
burn O
to O
DVD O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
, O
so O
I O
obviously O
could O
not O
live O
with O
a O
non O
- O
functioning O
drive B-AS
. O

I O
had O
my O
IWORKS B-AS
, O
Itunes B-AS
, O
Email O
, O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
never O
held O
a O
charge B-AS
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B-AS
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
've O
been O
Dell O
fan O
for O
more O
than O
fifteen O
years O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
macbook O
pros O
since O
2005 O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
yet O
! O

But O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

I'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher O
- O
end O
laptops O
, O
but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget B-AS
and O
the O
features B-AS
I O
need O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B-AS
. O

I O
would O
totally O
recommend O
any O
other O
laptop O
over O
this O
pile O
of O
grabage O
. O

Some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
blurry O
, O
some O
days O
it O
appears O
that O
it O
's O
raining O
on O
my O
nice O
desktop O
background O
of O
a O
lake O
and O
mountains O
. O

It O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

I O
've O
always O
owned O
a O
PC O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
MacBook O
to O
see O
what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
any O
high O
tech O
stuff O
on O
it O
, O
just O
write O
papers O
, O
check O
mail O
, O
and O
sometimes O
play O
games O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
reccomend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
. O

I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
! O

With O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
this O
computer O
it O
should O
have O
had O
everything O
on O
it O
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
I O
've O
noticed O
an O
electronic B-AS
fuzz I-AS
sound I-AS
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone B-AS
jack I-AS
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
. O

My O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
- O
- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
: O
Do O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
. O

) O
And O
printing O
from O
either O
word B-AS
processor I-AS
is O
an O
adventure O
. O

It O
's O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
'm O
thinking O
I O
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery B-AS
or O
something O
. O

I O
am O
enjoying O
it O
and O
the O
quality B-AS
it O
provides O
is O
great O
! O

Then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
, O
my O
left B-AS
`` I-AS
mouse I-AS
'' I-AS
button I-AS
snapped O
! O

This O
was O
an O
update O
from O
an O
early O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
can O
not O
even O
read O
what O
I O
am O
writing O
half O
of O
the O
time O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

The O
# O
1 O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

High O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
, O
however O
. O

Not O
even O
safe B-AS
mode I-AS
boots O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
the O
ideal O
college O
companion O
. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
another O
computer O
, O
I O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O
acer O
one O
computer O
. O

I O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
yet O
again O
. O

My O
wife O
also O
has O
problems O
with O
her O
Asus O
- O
different O
model O
. O

seriously O
why O
have O
n't O
they O
just O
replaced O
it O
by O
now O
. O

Sure O
hope O
Best O
Buy O
will O
replace O
it O
asap O
. O

Kind O
of O
annoying O
, O
but O
I O
still O
love O
the O
laptop O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

When O
I O
am O
next O
to O
my O
router O
on O
my O
HP O
I O
get O
full B-AS
service I-AS
, O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
I O
get O
3 O
bars O
. O

Great O
battery B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
, O
display B-AS
. O

It O
has O
no O
camera B-AS
but O
, O
I O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

By O
Air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
Me O
. O

My O
daughter O
uses O
it O
for O
games B-AS
, O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
pictures O
and O
music O
. O

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B-AS
! O

The O
computer O
will O
constantly O
be O
getting O
hot O
and O
burning O
your O
leg O
unless O
you O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
taking O
off O
the O
entire O
back O
of O
it O
just O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
fan B-AS
. O

I O
would O
never O
tell O
anyone O
to O
buy O
one O
either O
. O

Honestly O
, O
this O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
. O

Bigger O
HD B-AS
, O
better O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
, O
and O
a O
bid O
HD B-AS
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

It O
's O
very O
annoying O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
webcam B-AS
though O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
! O

This O
is O
my O
first O
personal O
Satellite O
purchase O
but O
had O
very O
good O
experience O
through O
previous O
Satellite O
work O
issued O
laptops O
. O

But O
Sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O
it O
back O
and O
be O
charged O
for O
adding B-AS
the I-AS
bluetooth I-AS
an O
additional O
seventy O
something O
dollars O
. O

it O
might O
be O
something O
deep O
within O
Windows B-AS
, O
for O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
create O
a O
disk B-AS
image I-AS
on O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

It O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
PC O
laptops O
, O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
, O
security B-AS
, O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
pricetag B-AS
. O

Hard B-AS
disk I-AS
- O
The O
new O
editions O
gives O
you O
more O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
space I-AS
( O
500GB O
instead O
of O
320GB O
) O
but O
time O
has O
taught O
me O
never O
to O
trust O
an O
internal B-AS
hard I-AS
disk I-AS
. O

Apple O
is O
always O
great O
about O
the O
aesthetics B-AS
of O
things O
, O
they O
always O
come O
up O
with O
good O
looking O
products O
. O

Since O
I O
purchased O
my O
Toshiba O
netbook O
, O
I O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
I O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

It O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
DIES O
( O
like O
a O
PC O
, O
maybe O
worse O
) O
and O
I O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

I O
was O
even O
able O
to O
uninstall O
McAffe O
and O
install O
one O
of O
my O
Symantec O
licenses O
with O
a O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

Needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery B-AS
, O
More O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
Hrs O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
Dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
I O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company B-AS
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left B-AS
mouse I-AS
key I-AS
broke O
and O
it O
costed B-AS
$ O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
left O
me O
with O
a O
HORRIBLE O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
for O
Acer O
brand O
products O
. O

So O
I O
called O
, O
AGAIN O
. O

It O
weighed B-AS
like O
seven B-AS
pounds I-AS
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

AND O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer B-AS
( O
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion O
/ O
offer O
going O
, O
of O
course O
) O
! O

Wireless B-AS
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O
for O
me O
, O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O
. O

However O
, O
my O
girlfriend O
realized O
that O
the O
netbook O
's O
hinge B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
loose O
( O
when O
you O
open O
or O
close O
the O
LCD B-AS
) O
. O

Numerous O
problems O
over O
the O
next O
3 O
weeks O
until O
I O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
and O
had O
to O
send O
the O
PC O
back O
to O
HP O
. O

As O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
, O
, O
about O
4 O
inches O
across O
is O
hardly O
visible O
. O

Waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

WIth O
the O
upgraded B-AS
memory I-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
never O
has O
an O
issue O
running B-AS
many O
many O
applications B-AS
at O
once O
! O

The O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
. O

Called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
Acer O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
software B-AS
but O
for O
$ O
$ O
$ O
we O
can O
help O
you O
'' O
I O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software B-AS
involved O
in O
booting B-AS
. O

THIS O
is O
what O
a O
laptop O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

the O
size B-AS
of O
has O
actually O
help O
me O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me O
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O
full O
backpack O
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O
table O
is O
always O
so O
space O
consuming O
. O

Call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs B-AS
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

however O
, O
they O
were O
kind O
enough O
to O
send O
a O
replacement O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

Now O
I O
had O
not O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
since O
the O
disc B-AS
drive I-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
and O
after O
taking O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
I O
found O
out O
they O
had O
accidently O
not O
used O
the O
right O
drive B-AS
when O
they O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
, O
so O
back O
it O
went O
to O
get O
the O
correct O
drive B-AS
. O

I O
Have O
a O
friend O
who O
has O
the O
other O
model O
and O
we O
put O
them O
side O
by O
side O
with O
the O
same O
dvd O
in O
( O
battle O
of O
the O
Smithsonian O
) O
After O
on O
Hour O
mine O
was O
at O
53 O
% O
life O
left O
and O
his O
was O
at O
69 O
% O
life O
left O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
for O
a O
better O
device O
. O

I O
purchased O
it O
this O
year O
when O
my O
old O
HP O
laptop O
finally O
died O
and O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
than O
a O
laptop O
to O
carry O
around O
for O
classes O
and O
traveling O
. O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
OSX B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features B-AS
that O
makes O
the O
use B-AS
more O
easy O
. O

Thinking O
about O
returning O
it O

3 O
weeks O
went O
by O
and O
the O
computer O
keeps O
crashing O
and O
will O
not O
open O
any O
applications B-AS
. O

Remember O
to O
do O
your O
research O
first O
before O
consider O
buying O
a O
toshiba O
product O
. O

I O
brought O
this O
laptop O
last O
friday O
, O
and O
originally O
it O
worked O
fantastic O
. O

Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
keeps O
me O
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
blazing O
speed B-AS
. O

All O
apple B-AS
associates I-AS
are O
always O
wiling O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

The O
reality O
was O
, O
it O
heated O
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O
things O
, O
like O
opening B-AS
my I-AS
Documents I-AS
folder I-AS
. O

lots O
of O
preloaded B-AS
software I-AS
. O

Took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

What O
's O
really O
great O
about O
this O
product O
is O
you O
may O
have O
a O
family O
member O
who O
is O
computer O
illiterate O
and O
you O
can O
pretty O
much O
just O
let O
them O
loose O
on O
this O
computer O
without O
any O
real O
supervision O
. O

But O
as O
time O
went O
on O
I O
found O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
keep O
the O
thing O
on- O
line O
through O
wi- O
fi O
. O

Sadly O
Apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
MacBook O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
Pros O
. O

It O
works B-AS
fine O
with O
our O
wireless O
and O
they O
've O
had O
not O
problems O
. O

The O
apple O
MacBook O
is O
the O
best O
investment O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

Shiny O
This O
Laptop O
is O
the O
Best O
of O
the O
best O
! O

Buy O
this O
if O
you O
like O
being O
tortured O
, O
teased O
, O
frustrated O
and O
wasting O
twice O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
spent O
using O
your O
old O
Mac O
. O

( O
I O
found O
a O
2GB O
stick O
for O
a O
bit O
under O
$ O
50 O
) O
Nice O
and O
portable O
and O
definitely O
a O
decent O
enough O
system B-AS
to O
keep O
you O
entertained O
while O
sitting O
in O
the O
airplane O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
or O
at O
the O
hotel O
taking O
care O
of O
some O
last O
minute O
details O
and O
documents O
. O

I O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

I O
always O
swore O
by O
PCs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
MAC O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

while O
about O
8 O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
has O
changed O
. O

I O
use O
a O
cooling B-AS
pad I-AS
but O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
. O

Currently O
if O
I O
use O
the O
laptop O
I O
ca O
n't O
sit O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
because O
it O
will O
burn O
my O
legs O
. O

- O
No O
backlit O
keyboard B-AS
, O
but O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

not O
the O
day O
received O
. O

The O
overall O
build B-AS
quality I-AS
of O
the O
unit O
is O
excellent O
and O
she O
'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
else O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
it O
has O
shit O
gigs B-AS
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
... O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nicely O
sized B-AS
laptop O
with O
lots O
of O
processing B-AS
power I-AS
and O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

It O
's O
software B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
enable O
it O
to O
do O
amazing O
things O
. O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
MacBooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B-AS
enclosure I-AS
- O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge B-AS
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
( O
very O
clever O
con O
) O
. O

I O
will O
not O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

The O
service B-AS
I O
received O
from O
Toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O
. O

lightweight O
, O
long O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
excellent O
transition O
from O
PC O
; O

I O
got O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
all O
the O
stuff O
I O
need O
to O
do O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
system B-AS
quitting O
on O
me O
or O
freezing O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

The O
perfect O
notebook O
... O

Small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
Light O
enough O
to O
carry B-AS
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O
trips O
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser B-AS
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O
. O

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
Microsoft B-AS
software I-AS
. O

On O
3 O
July O
2004 O
, O
I O
purcased O
this O
model O
at O
Best O
Buy O
for O
about O
$ O
150 O

It O
WORKS O
! O

Summary O
: O
After O
doing O
some O
investigation O
on O
the O
web O
, O
I O
have O
found O
that O
Toshiba O
NB205s O
are O
not O
chronically O
not O
booting O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
on O
different O
batteries B-AS
with O
no O
luck O
. O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
. O

The O
DVD B-AS
drive I-AS
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

All O
the O
problems O
I O
have O
had O
with O
PC O
's O
are O
solved O
with O
a O
Mac O
: O
the O
issue O
of O
overheating- O
my O
Dell O
was O
always O
overheating O
and O
not O
working O
properly O
or O
simply O
shutting O
off O
, O
and O
the O
issue O
of O
viruses O
and O
contaminants- O
my O
HP O
completely O
quit O
working O
within2 O
years O
of O
purchasing O
it O
, O
with O
no O
inexpensive O
way O
of O
fixing O
it O
. O

It O
was O
loaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
Home I-AS
Premium I-AS
- O
- O
delivered O
with O
only O
1GB B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
* O
dog O
* O
. O

A O
great O
computer O
for O
light O
home B-AS
use I-AS
and O
business B-AS
use I-AS
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
in O
college O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
. O

Great O
overall O
. O

Speakers B-AS
do O
n't O
get O
that O
loud O
, O
but O
good O
enough O
. O

It O
was O
just O
one O
problem O
after O
another O
for O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
reason O
we O
had O
forked O
out O
so O
much O
money O
was O
so O
we O
would O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

My O
last O
laptop O
gave O
me O
a O
constant O
battle O
even O
though O
it O
was O
also O
completely O
new O
. O

It O
is O
known O
as O
Safari B-AS
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
any O
website O
work O
, O
you O
should O
know O
that O
many O
hosting O
companies O
do O
not O
support O
it O
. O

I O
've O
been O
a O
PC O
user O
and O
I O
just O
finally O
switched O
and O
I O
am O
never O
going O
back O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
I O
bought O
this O
Mac O
, O
well O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

Most O
laptops O
and O
notebooks O
are O
difficult O
to O
key O
on O
. O

The O
So O
called O
laptop O
Runs B-AS
to O
Slow O
and O
I O
hate O
it O
! O

The O
Apple B-AS
applications I-AS
( O
ex O
. O
iPhoto B-AS
) O
are O
fun O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
to O
use O
( O
unlike O
the O
competition O
) O
! O

* O
6th O
week* O
- O
They O
are O
not O
responding O
to O
my O
emails O
asking O
when O
they O
expect O
to O
dispatch O
the O
new O
unit O
... O

The O
computer O
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery B-AS
because O
HP O
forgot O
to O
complete O
the O
required O
import O
paperwork O
. O

Apparently O
under O
the O
screen B-AS
there O
are O
2 O
little O
screws O
and O
when O
the O
screen B-AS
gets O
moved O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
they O
come O
loose O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
I O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O

The O
size B-AS
is O
perfect O
and O
I O
do O
not O
recomend O
anything O
bigger O
except O
for O
any O
person O
who O
can O
exceed O
the O
limited O
space B-AS
it O
gives O
you O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
I O
love O
it O
! O

little O
short O
on O
RAM B-AS
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system B-AS
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

This O
time O
the O
mouse B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
right B-AS
click I-AS
key I-AS
would O
n't O
work O
! O

It O
may O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
or O
other O
headaches O
. O

The O
Unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
wear O
- O
and O
- O
tear O
issue O
, O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
they O
CA O
N'T O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service B-AS
and O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
. O

Windows B-AS
is O
also O
rather O
unsteady O
on O
its O
feet O
and O
is O
susceptible O
to O
many O
bugs O
. O

Seems O
to O
slow O
down O
occassionally O
but O
can O
run O
many O
applications B-AS
( O
ie O
Internet B-AS
tabs I-AS
, O
programs B-AS
, O
etc O
) O
simultaneously O
. O

its O
sad O
because O
their O
commercials O
are O
great O
. O

Good O
price B-AS
. O

of O
course O
my O
warranty B-AS
runs O
out O
next O
month O
. O

Bought O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
take O
for O
starting O
college O
this O
fall O
- O
she O
has O
been O
on O
it O
non- O
stop O
ever O
since O
`` O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
it O
'' O
. O

Where O
you O
click O
and O
hold O
and O
drag O
it O
picture O
, O
link O
, O
etc O
to O
where O
you O
want O
it O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O
pcconnection O
express O
. O

That O
was O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

I O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
daughter O
because O
I O
just O
hated O
the O
screen B-AS
, O
hated O
that O
it O
had O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
to O
at O
least O
play O
cd O
's O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
and O
do O
schoolwork O
. O

The O
Internet B-AS
Explorer I-AS
was O
very O
slow O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

- O
They O
say O
it O
will O
take O
`` O
up O
to O
two O
weeks O
'' O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
its O
keyboard B-AS
easily O
accommodates O
large O
hands O
, O
and O
its O
weight B-AS
is O
fantasic O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
fine O
. O

I O
really O
wish O
I O
had O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
. O

Fast O
, O
fast O
and O
fast O
, O
the O
web O
pages O
just O
fly O
by O
. O

This O
was O
around O
three O
years O
, O
maybe O
four O
years O
ago O
. O

Let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
good O
: O
So O
awesome O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
back O
to O
DELL O
. O

How O
Toshiba O
handles O
the O
repair B-AS
seems O
to O
vary O
, O
some O
folks O
indicate O
that O
they O
were O
charged O
for O
even O
an O
intial O
fix O
, O
others O
had O
the O
repair B-AS
done O
5 O
times O
. O

I O
'm O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look B-AS
and O
dependability B-AS
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
. O

I O
take O
it O
everywhere O
with O
me O
because O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
. O

Summary O
: O
HP O
knew O
they O
were O
shipping O
out O
bad O
BIOS B-AS
and O
did O
nothing O
proactive O
to O
resolve O
it O
. O

They O
are O
not O
. O

I O
have O
a O
business O
website O
and O
every O
time O
I O
have O
to O
change O
something O
I O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
public O
library O
to O
use O
a O
PC O
. O

Well O
I O
spilled O
something O
on O
it O
and O
they O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
model O
, O
which O
gets O
hot O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
it O
through O
1 O
DVD O
. O

After O
4 O
days O
, O
being O
denied O
6 O
times O
and O
told O
off O
once O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
through O
and O
was O
able O
to O
send O
them O
a O
scanned O
copy O
of O
the O
receipt O
. O

It O
runs B-AS
perfectly O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
notebook O
expecting O
the O
performance B-AS
of O
a O
Desktop O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
. O

Am O
very O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

Runs B-AS
fast O
and O
the O
regular B-AS
layout I-AS
keyboard I-AS
is O
so O
much O
better O
. O

- O
Managed O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
. O

A O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

It O
works O
great O
for O
general O
internet B-AS
use I-AS
, O
Microsoft B-AS
Office I-AS
apps I-AS
, O
home O
bookkeeping O
, O
etc O
. O

This O
comes O
in O
very O
handy O
for O
me O
as O
an O
educator O
. O

I O
've O
had O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
15 O
for O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
really O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

my O
information O
was O
all O
lost O
( O
my O
fault O
, O
I O
know O
, O
but O
I O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
need O
to O
back O
up O
my O
information O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
Mac O
, O
the O
paragon O
of O
all O
computers O
! O

With O
awesome O
graphics B-AS
and O
assuring O
security B-AS
, O
it O
's O
perfect O
! O

The O
image B-AS
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
soud B-AS
is O
excelent O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
remember O
how O
I O
finally O
got O
it O
taken O
care O
of O
, O
but O
I O
was O
done O
with O
Sony O
after O
that O
! O

First O
, O
you O
ll O
discover O
that O
the O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
program I-AS
known O
as O
Appleworks B-AS
rarely O
translates O
perfectly O
on O
anyone O
else O
s O
computer O
, O
if O
it O
translates O
at O
all O
. O

Whenever O
I O
call O
Dell O
about O
an O
unrelated O
problem O
, O
they O
ask O
me O
if O
my O
laptop O
is O
running O
slowly O
and O
if O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
purchase O
more O
memory B-AS
for O
$ O
75 O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
to O
handle B-AS
and O
operate B-AS
at O
school O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
are O
stunning O
. O

I O
dislike O
the O
weight B-AS
and O
size B-AS
, O
cubersome O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
all O
the O
design O
tools O
on O
Pages B-AS
and O
Keynotes B-AS
makes O
it O
much O
easier O
to O
create O
professional O
looking O
documents O
and O
presentations O
. O

first O
i O
have O
been O
searching O
for O
long O
time O
before O
i O
decided O
to O
get O
mac O
. O

Money O
and O
time O
well O
spent O
! O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
the O
compatibility B-AS
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me O
think O
I O
ll O
buy O
a O
PC O
next O
time O
. O

They O
're O
absolutely O
useless O
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
joy O
of O
releasing O
anger O
while O
smashing O
into O
little O
peices O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

Taking O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
I O
found O
that O
a O
tiny O
plastic O
piece O
inside O
had O
broken O

I O
fine O
Apple O

Macboook O
Pro O
Notebook O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
laptop O
computer O
when O
on O
the O
go O
. O

I O
was O
WRONG O
! O

Many O
kinds O
of O
software B-AS
that O
is O
necessary O
to O
the O
working O
person O
is O
not O
available O
and O
can O
not O
be O
downloaded O
. O

But O
the O
Macbook O
is O
the O
best O
! O

At O
first O
, O
the O
computer O
seemed O
a O
great O
deal O
- O
- O
seemingly O
high O
- O
end O
specs B-AS
for O
a O
low O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

I O
can O
not O
even O
imaging O
going O
back O
to O
a O
PC O
after O
using O
this O
wonderful O
computer O
. O

It O
is O
her O
first O
laptop O
and O
she O
is O
thrilled O
. O

No O
machine O
has O
come O
remotely O
close O
to O
causing O
as O
many O
problems O
. O

Never O
any O
doubt O
I O
would O
get O
a O
MacBook O
, O
just O
was O
n't O
sure O
which O
one O
. O

If O
you O
faintly O
come O
close O
to O
touching O
this O
thing O
while O
typing O
, O
all O
craziness O
may O
break O
loose O
. O

You O
just O
get O
a O
trial O
version O
either O
way O
. O

My O
computer O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
school O
compared O
to O
my O
fellow O
classmates O
. O

So O
, O
the O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
capacity I-AS
really O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
me O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
was O
also O
very O
nice O
and O
had O
a O
solid O
feel O
. O

Anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
buying O
an O
Acer O
computer O
of O
any O
sort O
, O
I O
seriously O
suggest O
you O
look O
into O
buying O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

Hieroglyphics O
are O
quite O
common O
. O

I O
had O
it O
four O
months O
when O
my O
disc B-AS
drive I-AS
refused O
to O
open O
. O

But O
we O
had O
paid O
for O
bluetooth B-AS
, O
and O
there O
was O
none O
. O

Every O
single O
one O
we O
've O
gotten O
we O
've O
had O
problems O
with O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
. O

THis O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
almost O
2yrs O
old O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

There O
are O
no O
gold O
key O
numbers O
too O
intall O
programs B-AS
, O
you O
must O
use O
the O
serial O
numbers O
that O
it O
does O
not O
accept O
and O
then O
things O
are O
limited O
as O
far O
a O
working O
because O
they O
are O
only O
good O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

They O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty B-AS
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
Toshiba O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

It O
is O
everything O
I O
'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look B-AS
and I-AS
feel I-AS
standpoint I-AS
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O
. O

I O
actually O
had O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
replaced O
twice O
, O
the O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
once O
, O
the O
dvd B-AS
drive I-AS
twice O
, O
then O
they O
FINALLY O
agreed O
to O
replace O
it O
, O

this O

all O

we O
smoothly O
with O

The O
company O
sent O
me O
a O
whole O
new O
cord B-AS
overnight O
and O
apologized O
. O

I O
previously O
purchased O
a O
13 O
'' O
macbook O
( O
had O
pro O
specs B-AS
and O
was O
aluminum B-AS
style I-AS
) O
which O
had O
a O
nvidia B-AS
9800 I-AS
( O
If O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken O
) O
and O
it O
had O
major O
heating O
issues O
. O

Before O
, O
I O
reloaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Ultimate I-AS
and O
used O
only O
the O
downloaded O
drivers B-AS
from O
Acer O
's O
site O
. O

I O
can O
leave O
my O
MacBook O
uncharged O
for O
upwards O
of O
eight O
hours O
and O
it O
wo O
n't O
even O
be O
dead O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume B-AS
buttons I-AS
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
. O

Features B-AS
such O
as O
the O
Dashboard B-AS
( O
allows O
you O
to O
view O
frequently O
used O
tools O
like O
a O
calculator O
, O
weather O
forecast O
, O
movie O
times O
, O

, O
computer O
post O

etc O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
purposely O
`` O
destroy O
'' O
my O
netbook O
, O
so O
that O
I O
can O
demand O
a O
new O
set O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
public O
transport O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
and O
get O
a O
non O
- O
satisfactory O
solution O
? O
Or O
rather O
NO O
solution O
. O

I O
am O
very O
Happy O
! O

luckly O
i O
had O
a O
student O
task O
force O
able O
to O
help O
, O
or O
else O
it O
would O
have O
crashed O
within O
the O
first O
year O
. O

I O
constantly O
had O
to O
send O
my O
laptop O
in O
for O
services B-AS
every O
3 O
months O
and O
it O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
same O
problem O
that O
they O
said O
they O
had O
already O
fixed O
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O
laptop O
. O

Will O
certainly O
use O
MacConnection O
again O
. O

I O
was O
so O
excited O
when O
my O
dad O
said O
i O
could O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

I O
went O
from O
BestBuy O
to O
Dell O
, O
Windows O
to O
Apple O
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
hp O
pavillion O
and O
that O
was O
my O
replacement O
and O
now O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
going O
back O
to O
an O
acer O
at O
all O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
promised O
about O
10 O
hours O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
to O
a O
limited O
7 O
hours O
( O
which O
is O
still O
amazing O
) O
. O

This O
is O
basically O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
or O
used O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery B-AS
lasted O
on O
a O
single O
charge B-AS
. O

I O
love O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
use O
it O
everyday O
to O
do O
something O
, O
and O
never O
lets O
me O
down O
. O

The O
letter B-AS
A I-AS
stopped O
working O
after O
the O
first O
week O
. O

DEFINITELY O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O

This O
laptop O
is O
insane O
! O
! O
! O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
software B-AS
I O
have O
wo O
n't O
work O
with O
Mac O
and O
iWork B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
of O
it O
. O

It O
was O
about O
six O
months O
later O
when O
the O
overheating O
problem O
started O
again O
, O
to O
the O
point O
it O
felt O
like O
fire O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
machine O
! O

I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
machine O
! O

We O
carry O
the O
netbook O
around O
here O
and O
there O
, O
hence O
it O
's O
kinda O
of O
irritating O
when O
the O
LCD B-AS
just O
`` O
slide O
'' O
downwards O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
since O
I O
bought O
my O
Mac O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
ever O
go O
back O
to O
any O
Windows B-AS
. O

Because O
he O
said O
that O
the O
hinge B-AS
is O
under O
the O
motherboard B-AS
and O
they O
have O
to O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
before O
it O
can O
be O
tightened O
. O

You O
will O
need O
them O
if O
you O
want O
to O
reload O
the O
OS B-AS
( O
I O
recommend O
doing O
if O
you O
can O
to O
start O
fresh O
and O
optimal O
) O
. O

No O
luck O
, O
although O
I O
waited O
for O
hours O
on O
the O
phone O
- O
Visited O
MacHouse O
, O
they O
stated O
the O
their O
call B-AS
center I-AS
is O
down O
due O
to O
too O
many O
phonecalls O
( O
difficult O
to O
believe O
) O
. O

Received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

We O
upgraded O
the O
memory B-AS
to O
four O
gigabytes O
in O
order O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
performace B-AS
increase O
in O
speed B-AS
. O

It O
just O
works B-AS
flawlessly O
! O

With O
a O
mac O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus B-AS
software I-AS
or O
firewall B-AS
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
. O

The O
only O
objection O
I O
have O
is O
that O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
system I-AS
is O
a O
starter O
and O
charges O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

I O
chose O
the O
iBookG4 O
, O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
an O
attractive O
computer O
with O
a O
large O
screen B-AS
big O
enough O
to O
please O
anyone O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it O
was O
not O
as O
user O
friendly O
as O
I O
expected O
either O
. O

I O
or O
my O
dad O
paid O
over O
twenty O
four O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
everything O
. O

I O
got O
a O
mac O
as O
my O
HS O
graduation O
gift O
. O

Im O
glad O
that O
it O
has O
such O
great O
features B-AS
in O
it O
. O

Very O
small O
and O
portable O
I O
've O
had O
this O
netbook O
about O
12 O
hrs O
now O
and O
It O
's O
better O
than O
expected O
. O

and O
looks O
very O
sexyy O
: O
D O
really O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
specially O
for O
students O
in O
college O
if O
you O
are O
not O
caring O
about O
price B-AS
. O

There O
are O
no O
viruses O
or O
spyware O
to O
worry O
about O
like O
on O
a O
Windows B-AS
computer O
. O

But O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
so O
professional O
. O

it O
has O
had O
some O
problems O
. O

Might O
not O
make O
the O
avid O
gamer O
happy O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
is O
what O
this O
computer O
is O
designed O
for O
. O

I O
lost O
two O
items O
I O
was O
working O
on O
until O
I O
figured O
out O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

It O
is O
a O
REAL O
touchpad B-AS
, O
not O
the O
toy O
I O
saw O
in O
other O
brands O
. O

I O
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
out O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers B-AS
and O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
. O

This O
purchase O
opened O
me O
to O
the O
world O
of O
Macbooks O
, O
and O
I O
am O
impressed O
with O
the O
intuition O
of O
the O
design B-AS
, O
the O
beauty B-AS
of O
the O
product O
, O
and O
the O
excellent O
technological O
advances O
associated O
with O
it O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
works B-AS
like O
a O
dream O
, O
it O
has O
never O
overheated O
, O
or O
even O
been O
slightly O
warm O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

Never O
been O
hacked O
. O

I O
love O
the O
size B-AS
, O
keyboard B-AS
, O
the O
functions B-AS
. O

Hewlett O
Packard O
HP O
Pavillion O
DV6000 O
Laptop O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
we O
have O
ever O
bought O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
ran B-AS
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Within O
3 O
weeks O
the O
same O
issues O
started O
happening O
AGAIN O
. O

As O
with O
any O
laptop O
not O
purchased O
with O
software B-AS
options I-AS
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
what O
I O
consider O
useless O
applications B-AS
. O

Pairing O
it O
with O
an O
iPhone O
is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O
- O
talk O
about O
painless O
syncing B-AS
- O
used O
to O
take O
me O
forever O
- O
now O
it O
's O
a O
snap O
. O

And O
inconvenient O
! O

I O
could O
not O
handle O
it O
one O
hand O
like O
I O
can O
the O
replacement O
computer O
I O
purchased O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
can O
easily O
carry B-AS
around O
in O
a O
knapsack O
full O
of O
text O
books O
and O
it O
barely O
adds O
any O
weight B-AS
. O

Great O
product O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

I O
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O
using O
two O
fingers O
on O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

the O
key B-AS
bindings I-AS
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
, O
but O
have O
loved O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
. O

I O
burned O
my O
leg O
, O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
, O
and O
for O
less O
than O
5 O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
, O
so O
I O
can O
place O
it O
there O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
issued O
a O
replacement O
RMA O
for O
a O
few O
dead O
pixels O
in O
the O
upper O
zone O
of O
the O
screen B-AS
, O
which O
is O
noticable O
to O
me O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
also O
have O
several O
great O
software B-AS
packages I-AS
that O
came O
for O
free O
including O
iWork B-AS
, O
GarageBand B-AS
, O
and O
iMovie B-AS
. O

The O
capabilities O
using O
that O
program B-AS
alone O
made O
me O
want O
a O
Mac O
. O

The O
casing B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
power I-AS
cord I-AS
fried O
and O
shocked O
my O
husband O
when O
he O
pulled O
it O
out O
of O
the O
socket O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
change O
about O
it O
is O
the O
mouse B-AS
keys I-AS
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
to O
replace O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
. O

the O
features B-AS
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O
speakers B-AS
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O
ability O
, O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O
to O
one O
of O
the O
more O
robust O
versions O
of O
Win B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
grab O
a O
2GB B-AS
stick I-AS
of I-AS
memory I-AS
to O
spice O
it O
all O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

Good O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

) O
I O
also O
purchased O
Applecare B-AS
for O
$ O
300 O
, O
which O
is O
a O
three O
year O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
since O
I O
ve O
never O
seen O
any O
laptop O
that O
lasted O
more O
than O
two O
. O

If O
what O
you O
need O
is O
a O
machine O
to O
do O
some O
surfing B-AS
, O
email O
checking O
, O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
, O
and O
watching O
a O
movie O
or O
two O
, O
this O
is O
the O
machine O
you O
want O
. O

So O
we O
exchanged O
it O
for O
the O
same O
on O
and O
after O
2 O
hours O
it O
did O
n't O
work B-AS
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
and O
they O
refused O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O
. O

Everything O
was O
up O
and O
running O
within O
15 O
minutes O
of O
unboxing O
. O

C'mon O
, O
LG O
. O

I O
spoke O
to O
4 O
different O
people O
and O
was O
told O
they O
needed O
to O
transfer O
me O
to O
a O
5th O
person O
! O

I O
hate O
the O
display B-AS
screen I-AS
and O
I O
have O
done O
everything O
I O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
. O

What O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
. O

However O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
last O
as O
well O
. O

I O
did O
a O
review O
on O
it O
, O
its O
awesome O
. O

Apple O
continues O
to O
shine O
and O
provide O
a O
much O
more O
enjoyable O
computer O
experience O
! O

They O
told O
me O
to O
reprogram O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
pictures O
of O
my O
oldests O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
her O
life O
. O

Clearly O
, O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
product O
and O
LG O
did O
n't O
take O
up O
the O
responsibility O
. O

One O
drawback O
, O
I O
wish O
the O
keys B-AS
were O
backlit O
. O

I O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
universal B-AS
charger I-AS
for O
this O
cheap O
$ O
300 O
laptop O
. O

It O
discharges B-AS
too O
quickly O
. O

It O
all O
just O
makes O
sense O
. O

Obviously O
, O
this O
Macbook O
is O
P- O
E- O
R- O
F- O
E- O
C- O
T O
for O
me O
because O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
I O
need O
in O
an O
easy- O
to- O
function O
way O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
for O
sure O
. O

I O
now O
travel O
with O
this O
laptop O
and O
my O
work O
PC O
. O

Yeah O
, O
to O
you O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
for I-AS
Mac I-AS
, O
which O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

The O
love O
part O
of O
my O
relationship O
with O
this O
laptop O
does O
n't O
take O
very O
long O
. O

There O
are O
differences O
that O
you O
need O
to O
know O
and O
take O
time O
to O
learn O
. O

Summary O
: O
I O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
2 O
months O
, O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
the O
power B-AS
adapter I-AS
stops O
working O
. O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
is O
head O
and O
shoulders O
above O
my O
first O
. O

My O
house O
is O
now O
100 O
% O
Macbook O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
wrong O
with O
this O
product O
, O
it O
just O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
set O
my O
self O
on O
fire O
! O

I O
do O
everything O
on O
this O
computer O
- O
check O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
shop O
, O
check O
blogs O
, O
write O
papers O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
, O
and O
we O
even O
watch O
all O
of O
our O
movies O
on O
it O
since O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
tv O
. O

Everything O
I O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
I O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall B-AS
charger I-AS
cause O
the O
battery B-AS
is O
so O
awesome O
. O

PDF O
files O
can O
be O
viewed O
instantly O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
is O
such O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

i O
'm O
returning O
mine O

Prior O
to O
this O
computer O
, O
I O
owned O
a O
PowerBook O
G4 O
for O
6 O
years O
( O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
laptop O
) O
. O

It O
's O
also O
fairly O
easy O
to O
use O
the O
Operating B-AS
System I-AS
. O

Laptop O
was O
in O
new O
condition O
and O
operational O
, O
but O
for O
the O
audio B-AS
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O
. O

I O
am O
forever O
changed O
and O
will O
no O
longer O
buy O
a O
Windows B-AS
based O
machine O
for O
personal O
use O
. O

Very O
dissappointed O
becase O
I O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

I O
love O
the O
solid O
machined B-AS
aluminum I-AS
frame I-AS
, O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
the O
best O
of O
any O
laptop O
I O
've O
used O
. O

Best O
thing O
is O
I O
can O
use O
existing O
32 O
bit O
old O
programs B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
wo O
n't O
last O
more O
than O
1 O
/ O
2 O
an O
hour O
. O

the O
only O
fact O
i O
dont O
like O
about O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O
use O
safari B-AS
and O
i O
dont O
use O
safari B-AS
but O
after O
i O
install O
Mozzilla B-AS
firfox I-AS
i O
love O
every O
single O
bit O
about O
it O
. O

Games B-AS
being O
the O
main O
issue O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
battery B-AS
does O
not O
last O
very O
long O
at O
all O
. O

Summary O
: O
Spend O
your O
money O
elsewhere O

I O
paid O
about O
the O
same O
for O
my O
Toshiba O
as O
I O
did O
for O
the O
compaq O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

You O
can O
call O
HP O
and O
they O
want O
you O
to O
buy O
more O
software B-AS
to O
fix O
it O
. O

A O
seventy O
dollar O
mouse B-AS
! O

The O
Computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
stinks O
. O

Summary O
: O
They O
played O
games O
with O
me O
for O
the O
warranty B-AS
period I-AS
. O

I O
was O
constantly O
having O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
computer O
after O
doing O
updates O
. O

Toshiba O
is O
a O
great O
brand O
, O
even O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
! O

Long O
story O
, O
but O
after O
many O
calls O
to O
various O
offices O
, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
no O
one O
can O
override O
the O
depot B-AS
and O
that O
managers O
do O
n't O
take O
phone O
calls O
or O
e O
/ O
mails O
. O

Seriously O
considering O
a O
larger O
laptop O
to O
replace O
the O
Dell O

I O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
Mac O
before O
; O

That O
is O
pretty O
sad O
when O
they O
name O
them O
specifically O
. O

When O
I O
called O
Toshiba O
, O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
$ O
35 O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
, O
even O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
offer O
any O
technical B-AS
support I-AS
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
I O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
. O

They O
removed O
them O
and O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
me O
. O

I O
love O
the O
15 O
'' O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
if O
you O
want O
the O
best O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

this O
one O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O
! O

My O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
efficient O
than O
a O
PC O
so O
it O
does O
not O
need O
the O
extra O
bells O
and O
whistles O
to O
compete O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
days O
after O
I O
received O
the O
computer O
back O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
froze O
again O
. O

I O
noticed O
windows B-AS
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
what O
about O
us O
Vista B-AS
users O
? O
They O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
Vista B-AS
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
. O

LOVE O
IT O
LOVE O
IT O
LOVE O
IT O
! O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
computer O
for O
anything O
like O
graphics B-AS
editing I-AS
and O
complex B-AS
data I-AS
analysis I-AS
and O
gaming B-AS
. O

And O
these O
are O
some O
reasons O
you O
should O
get O
a O
macbook O
pro O
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

I O
Contacted O
HP O
about O
this O
situation O
and O
was O
given O
excuses O
, O
without O
results O
. O

Love O
the O
stability B-AS
of O
the O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
and O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

I O
know O
that O
ASUS O
is O
known O
for O
making O
motherboards B-AS
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
experience O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size B-AS
. O

For O
those O
that O
care O
about O
noise B-AS
this O
thing O
does O
n't O
really O
make O
any O
; O

Not O
working O
= O
bad O

You O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
a O
satellite B-AS
card I-AS
which O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

Then O
it O
ceased O
charging B-AS
at O
all O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
and O
screen B-AS
are O
stunning O
and O
although O
I O
was O
a O
PC O
person O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
understand O
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

Went O
silently O
. O

My O
Toshiba O
did O
not O
have O
sound B-AS
on O
everything O
, O
just O
certain O
things O
. O

We O
did O
not O
even O
have O
it O
a O
year O
. O

Disappointing O
for O
such O
a O
lovely O
screen B-AS
and O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B-AS

Great O
Laptop O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
works B-AS
well O
with O
action B-AS
pack I-AS
games I-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
probably O
an O
hour O
at O
best O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
IT O
retail O
sales O
before O
. O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

Anyways O
I O
bought O
this O
two O
months O
ago O
and O
when O
I O
first O
brought O
it O
home O
it O
kept O
giving O
me O
a O
message O
about O
a O
vibration O
in O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
it O
is O
putting O
it O
temporaly O
in O
save O
zone O
. O

Finally O
set O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
HP O
after O
a O
month O
of O
hell O
. O

I O
'll O
wait O
and O
save O
up O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

I O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software B-AS
on O
it O
. O

Everything O
is O
falling O
apart O
internally O
and O
externally O
. O

I O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30 B-AS
'' I-AS
HD I-AS
Monitor I-AS
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen B-AS
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

- O
They O
reported O
that O
the O
computer O
is O
in O
their O
headquarters O
. O

Time O
will O
tell O
. O

The O
notebook O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
again O
. O

I O
love O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
key B-AS
board I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
trackpad B-AS
. O

The O
Dell O
mini O
was O
the O
first O
Dell O
product O
that O
I O
had O
ever O
purchased O
. O

This O
was O
purchased O
for O
my O
daughter O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

Have O
had O
many O
higher O
priced B-AS
computers O
crash O
and O
burn O
long O
before O
ever O
got O
to O
use O
all O
that O
great O
memory B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

After O
about O
a O
week O
I O
finally O
got O
it O
back O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
motherboard B-AS
had O
failed O
and O
so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O
motherboard B-AS
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O
I O
am O
with O
their O
product B-AS
and I-AS
help I-AS
aftermarket I-AS
. O

the O
manufacturer O
's O
warranty B-AS
only O
covers O
replacement O
/ O
repair O
of O
parts O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
not O
every O
unit O
has O
this O
issue O
, O
but O
the O
ones O
that O
do O
can O
not O
be O
repaired O
. O

Many O
of O
my O
classmates O
computers O
hard B-AS
drives I-AS
crashed O
. O

After O
they O
found O
no O
other O
way O
, O
they O
told O
me O
to O
courier O
it O
to O
them O
( O
since O
they O
do O
n't O
allow O
the O
use O
of O
the O
post O
office O
) O
at O
my O
expense O
, O
and O
sent O
me O
a O
4 O
page O
list O
of O
very O
specific O
packaging O
instructions O
to O
follow O
or O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
covered O
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
extremely O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
to O
those O
heavy O
Windows O
Laptop O
. O

I O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
3 O
for O
my O
office O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
incredibly O
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O
than O
my O
PowerBook O
and O
very O
crisp O
. O

Later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge B-AS
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
. O

I O
never O
had O
this O
kind O
of O
quality B-AS
issue O
with O
Dell O
( O
not O
to O
say O
Dell O
is O
that O
great O
) O
, O
not O
with O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

Battery B-AS
is O
lasting O
about O
6 O
hours O
as O
I O
am O
surfing B-AS
the I-AS
web I-AS
on O
Sundays O
while O
checking O
football O
scores O
and O
watching O
funny O
Youtube O
videos O

But O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
. O

Avoid O
this O
model O
. O

So O
I O
'd O
pop O
them O
off O
to O
see O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
, O
well O
guess O
what O
? O
The O
darn O
thing O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
on O
. O

The O
Toshiba O

DESIGNED O
to O
fail O
! O

The O
software B-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

lots O
of O
extra O
space B-AS
but O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B-AS
broad I-AS
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

The O
minute O
you O
fire O
it O
up O
it O
's O
all O
good O
, O
very O
easy O
user B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

Love O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
up O

like O
a O
regular O

Enjoy O
that O

It O
played O
various O

ran O

I O
tried O
out O

a O
few O
months O

I O
honestly O
love O

why O

not O

a O

I O

It O

it O

a O

I O
still O
have O
that O
stupid O

! O

My O
MacBook O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
investment O
I O
have O
ever O
made O

I O
asked O
how O
they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
, O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
. O

I O
've O
always O
used O
PC O
's O
for O
work O
home O
and O
this O
is O
my O
first O
experience O
with O
a O
Mac O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
purchase O
of O
this O
modle O
of O
Toshiba O
Computer O
or O
any O
Toshiba O
product O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

and O
it O
has O
blue O

I O
really O
do O

like O
it O

I O
am O
stuck O

Amazing O
Quality B-AS

I O
would O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
just O
got O
from O
Mac O
. O

Take O
your O
time O
and O
go O
through O
the O
tutorials B-AS
patiently O
. O

It O
is O
the O
easiest O
computer O
I O
have O
ever O
used O

Now O
, O
I O
guess O
, O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
unload O
my O
M6809 O
on O
some O
poor O
, O
hapless O
soul O
. O

I O
should O
have O
spent O
an O
extra O
hundred O
bucks O
and O
got O
a O
full O
sized O
computer O
. O

Never O
had O
a O
single O
problem O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
and O
i O
still O
do O
. O

The O
apple O
macbook O
pro O
nothing O
to O
say O
butprofessionally O
great O
and O
outstanding O
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
pad I-AS
, O
the O
left B-AS
button I-AS
always O
sticks O
. O

This O
computer O
does O
n't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games B-AS
it O
ca O
n't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

It O
's O
fast O
and O
has O
excellent O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

It O
is O
good O
to O
know O
that O
I O
can O
mobilize O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
've O
been O
having O
endless O
problems O
since O
I O
bought O
the O
computer O
- O
only O
1 O
month O
ago O

It O
is O
amazing O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
lie O
, O
I O
've O
never O
really O
liked O
the O
Acer O
brand O
in O
general O
. O

both O
upgrades O
were O
quickly O
accomplished O
after O
purchasing O
the O
necessary O
Product O
Key O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
does O
n't O
last O
long O
but O
I O
'm O
sure O
an O
upgrade O
battery B-AS
would O
solve O
that O
problem O
. O

But O
enough O
about O
that O
, O
I O
am O
an O
Apple O
convert O
for O
life O
. O

It O
took O
a O
little O
over O
2 O
weeks O
until O
i O
got O
it O
back O
. O

When O
calling O
Dell O
for O
help O
, O
reurn O
, O
or O
a O
new O
computer O
they O
were O
not O
useful O
and O
left O
it O
up O
to O
myself O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Very O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
well O
made O
. O

tons O
of O
bloatware O
and O
junk O
programs B-AS
. O

Me O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
bought O
the O
Gateway O
NV78 O
in O
nov O
of O
09 O
. O

The O
video B-AS
card I-AS
is O
great O
for O
media B-AS
, O
and O
above O
average O
for O
gaming B-AS
, O
but O
not O
a O
gamers O
first O
choice O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
to O
my O
friends O

I O
'm O
honestly O
afraid O
that O
it O
will O
burn O
me O
, O
it O
's O
that O
hot O
! O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
it O
only O
two O
months O
! O

I O
LOVE O
it O
! O

I O
was O
ready O
to O
take O
it O
back O
for O
a O
refund O
, O
but O
the O
Geek B-AS
Squad I-AS
camed O
through O
and O
pointed O
me O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

Summary O
: O
Dont O
buy O
HP O
. O

I O
had O
the O
staff B-AS
telling O
me O
older O
version O
did O
not O
make O
the O
fan B-AS
noise I-AS
cause O
it O
is O
a O
`` O
different O
'' O
computer O
. O

Would O
like O
more O
trendy O
, O
high O
tech O
features B-AS
. O

The O
quality B-AS
, O
engineering B-AS
design I-AS
and O
warranty B-AS
are O
superior O
- O
- O
covers O
damage O
from O
dropping O
the O
laptop O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

Probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

No O
waiting O
to O
have O
my O
claim O
reviewed O
by O
someone O
in O
another O
state O
( O
or O
more O
often O
, O
another O
country O
) O
. O

Please O
, O
anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
stop O
. O

There O
is O
hardly O
any O
memory B-AS
on O
the O
computer O
's O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
another O
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
gorgeous O
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
good O
. O

I O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
HP O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
next O
issue O
I O
had O
freaked O
me O
out O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
Envy O
. O

Who O
knows O
what O
will O
happen O
later O
on O
when O
they O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
damn O
thing O
? O
So O
, O
I O
said O
I O
wanted O
a O
new O
set O
. O

Having O
someone O
give O
you O
a O
quick O
tour O
of O
how O
to O
's O
is O
the O
best O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
, O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O

They O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
did O
n't O
work B-AS
. O

Toshiba O
knows O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
but O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
it O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
play O
a O
first O
- O
person O
shooter O
with O
this O
, O
mind O
, O
but O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
run O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
email O
, O
chat O
, O
download O
a O
video O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
from O
a O
certain O
fruit O
- O
named O
music O
store O
, O
and O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
highly O
portable O
yet O
powerful O
netbook O
to O
do O
that O
all O
in O
, O
I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
checking O
this O
out O
. O

The O
online B-AS
tutorial I-AS
videos I-AS
make O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
learn O
if O
you O
have O
always O
used O
a O
PC O
. O

But O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
iLife B-AS
is O
great O
and O
I O
love O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
X I-AS
. O

And O
that O
probably O
explains O
why O
I O
've O
already O
had O
my O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
go O
bad O
within O
a O
year O
of O
buying O
it O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Waiting O
for O
the O
i7 B-AS
was O
well O
worth O
it O
, O
great O
value O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

With O
today O
's O
company O
fighting O
over O
marketshare O
, O
its O
a O
shame O
that O
ASUS O
can O
get O
away O
with O
the O
inept O
staff B-AS
answering O
thephone O
. O

At O
first O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
then O
the O
system B-AS
board I-AS
failed O
and O
I O
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O
some O
complaints O
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
I O
then O
receive O
my O
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
I O
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again O
. O

At O
first O
when O
I O
got O
this O
product O
, O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
reasonable O
size B-AS
. O

VERY O
disappointing O
: O

They O
discovered O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
defect O
and O
sent O
it O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

( O
No O
problem O
with O
the O
ordering O
or O
shipping B-AS
by O
the O
way O
. O

But O
not O
in O
this O
case O
. O

I O
am O
currently O
out O
of O
town O
and O
called O
to O
inform O
them O
the O
broken O
part O
would O
be O
returned O
when O
I O
got O
back O
in O
town O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
new O
computer O
for O
graduate O
school O
( O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
laptop O
before O
) O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
did O
n't O
purchase O
a O
Mac O
was O
because O
my O
school O
's O
website O
strongly O
recommended O
students O
purchase O
PCs O
. O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B-AS
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
. O

I O
reinstalled O
windows B-AS
through O
the O
recovery B-AS
discs I-AS
and O
everything O
seemed O
good O
again O
. O

Both O
computers O
started O
acting O
extremely O
slow O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
owning O
them O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
so O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
had O
a O
computer O
in O
the O
living O
room O
; O

The O
price B-AS
is O
great O
for O
this O
model O
, O
I O
only O
plan O
on O
using O
it O
for O
media O
in O
the O
entertainment O
room O
. O

Apple B-AS
care I-AS
included O
. O

A O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
: O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
IT O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

That O
's O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

( O
I O
had O
been O
a O
Windows B-AS
/ O
Linux B-AS
user O
before O
this O
) O
I O
love O
the O
size B-AS
because O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
use O
it O
for O
( O
Internet O
, O
artwork O
) O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O
portable O
. O

After O
paying O
over O
$ O
1000 O
for O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

No O
viruses O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
updated O
is O
the O
video B-AS
, O
other O
than O
that O
you O
're O
all O
set O
. O

at O
first O
! O

It O
's O
a O
long O
and O
tirring O
process O
that O
after O
a O
while O
it O
seems O
like O
their O
game O
plan O
was O
to O
wear O
you O
out O
so O
you O
would O
want O
to O
give O
up O
on O
contacting O
them O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
value B-AS
for O
the O
money O
. O

You O
will O
love O
this O
macbook O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

Stupidly O
, O
mind- O
numbingly O
slow- O
- O
then O
I O
found O
it O
can O
only O
be O
loaded O
with O
2GB O
* O
maximum* O
. O

This O
system O
came O
loaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
. O

I O
have O
the O
A65 O
- O
right O
now O
it O
's O
a O
paperweight O
. O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
the O
Mac O
Book O
was O
that O
I O
went O
on O
my O
honeymoon O
and O
shot O
a O
bunch O
of O
pictures O
and O
movies O
with O
my O
iPhone O
, O
then O
I O
came O
back O
and O
put O
them O
onto O
my O
Macbook O
and O
made O
a O
pretty O
good O
DVD O
movie O
with O
all O
the O
pictures O
and O
videos O
from O
my O
trip O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

It O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use B-AS
, O
I O
use O
it O
more O
than O
my O
desktop O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
begin O
to O
say O
how O
disappointed O
I O
am O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
additional O
money O
right O
now O
, O
and O
therefore O
would O
n't O
have O
purchased O
it O
at O
this O
time O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
model O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
, O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
! O

Buy O
this O
. O

Its O
Office B-AS
compatible O
, O
but O
the O
features B-AS
and O
its O
functioning B-AS
is O
all O
new O
again O
so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
save O
the O
money O
and O
just O
learn O
the O
pre O
installed O
mac O
programs B-AS
. O

It O
does O
not O
keep O
internet B-AS
signals I-AS
no O
matter O
where O
you O
bring O
it O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
started O
using O
Google B-AS
Chrome I-AS
, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
, O
but O
it O
freezes O
too O
sometimes O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
a O
great O
price B-AS
! O

another O
problem O
. O

This O
one O
has O
had O
the O
same O
effect O
. O

The O
powerpoint B-AS
opened O
seamlessly O
in O
the O
apple O
and O
the O
mac O
hooked O
up O
to O
the O
projector O
so O
easily O
it O
was O
almost O
scary O
. O

I O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
MAC O
, O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
PC O
laptop O
. O

It O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

The O
speed B-AS
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
work O
on O
these O
projects O
seamlessly O
, O
and O
multiple O
at O
a O
time O
if O
you O
sowish O
. O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O
finger O
and O
the O
pointer B-AS
will O
not O
even O
move O
. O

super O
fast O
processor B-AS
and O
really O
nice O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
.. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

Breaking O
within O
1 O
year O
of O
purchase O
and O
speaking O
to O
4+ O
people O
to O
report O
the O
damaged O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
late O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
driver B-AS
for O
my O
HP O
and O
they O
would O
not O
help O
me O
with O
out O
me O
paying O
over O
$ O
50 O
for O
it O
. O

You O
will O
regret O
it O
if O
you O
buy O
any O
dell O
. O

Three O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
has O
advantages O
over O
pcs O
' O
with O
linux B-AS
based I-AS
os I-AS
there O
is O
very O
'few O
problems O
with O
system B-AS
performance I-AS
when O
it O
comes O
to O

Long O
story O
short O
, O
since O
I O
experience O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
every O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
from O
day O
one O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
or O
a O
refund O
of O
what O
I O
pay O
for O
a O
crapy O
laptop O
, O
but O
just O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
laptop O
warranty B-AS
for O
another O
year O
, O
they O
made O
a O
big O
deal O
of O
out O
that O
and O
after O
so O
many O
calls O
and O
complaints O
about O
their O
products O
and O
services O
, O
they O
finally O
gave O
in O
. O
