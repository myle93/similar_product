all O
the O

are O
necessary O
for O

if O
not O

so O
great O

I O
can O
Hardly O
ever O
take O
my O

off O
it O

( O
I O
definatly O
ca O

Ok O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
Apple O

But O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
is O
not O
available O
24 O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
anyone O
can O
use O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
impressed O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
even O
after O
paying O
staples O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
speed O
it O
up O

i O
love O
to O
use O
it O
it O

It O

big O

since O

what O

I O
would O
say O
if O

In O
the O
past O
four O
years O
I O
've O
had O
it O
I O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
. O

I O
Love O
my O
new O
computer O
! O

I O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
did O
think O
it O
had O
a O
camera B-AS
because O
that O
was O
one O
of O
my O
requirements O
, O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications B-AS
on O
this O
one O
before O
I O
purchased O
. O

But O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O
operation B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS

Thank O
God O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
've O
been O
using O
laptops O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
and O
probably O
the O
majority O
of O
brands O
out O
there O
. O

Overall O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

Originally O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

Apparently O
well O
- O
built B-AS
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look B-AS
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price B-AS
and O
performance B-AS
. O

THIS O
IS O
MY O
SECOND O
MAC O
BOOK O
PRO O
. O

I O
got O
assurances O
from O
2 O
different O
people O
that O
the O
remaining O
10 O
months O
of O
my O
warranty B-AS
would O
transfer O
to O
the O
new O
computer O
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

This O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

Although O
my O
model O
was O
listed O
as O
recalled O
, O
HP O
denied O
my O
claim O
. O

An O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
. O

The O
price B-AS
premium I-AS
is O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features B-AS
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O
. O

Despite O
the O
claims O
of O
the O
Apple O
apologists O
( O
a O
vice O
of O
which O
I O
am O
recently O
myself O
reformed O
) O
the O
internals B-AS
of O
Mac O
laptops O
are O
NO O
different O
from O
PCs O
' O
at O
this O
point O
. O

Theres O
a O
built B-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
with O
special O
effects O
- O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
. O

And O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company B-AS
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
opened O
the O
box O
to O
the O
present O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
joy O
. O

It O
has O
happened O
again O
and O
I O
'm O
being O
told O
that O
it O
's O
$ O
175 O
. O

Again O
. O

I O
claim O
that O
this O
has O
no O
value O
to O
me O
, O
the O
laptop O
was O
new O
anyway O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
space B-AS
bar I-AS
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-AS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

But O
see O
the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
different O
because O
it O
may O
have O
a O
huge O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
but O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
full O
software B-AS
that O
you O
would O
actually O
need O
and O
most O
of O
it O
has O
free O
future O
updates B-AS
. O

Took O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
defective O
. O

also O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
compared O
to O
others O
. O

Maybe O
three O
or O
four O
months O
ago O
it O
started O
blinking O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
. O

Very O
very O
disappointed O
! O

It O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

Received O
all O
four O
in O
good O
order O
; O

They O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard B-AS
again O
, O
but O
Dell O

Again O
, O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
the O
right B-AS
speaker I-AS
did O
not O
work O
. O

All O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-AS
cd I-AS
's I-AS
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

I O
should O
have O
bought O
one O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

It O
started O
out O
getting O
hot O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
. O

By O
the O
way O
teachers O
, O
they O
offer O
a O
discount O
which O
helps O
! O

It O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
memory B-AS
and O
a O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

After O
years O
of O
using O
PCs O
, O
a O
new O
Mac O
user O
is O
basically O
forced O
to O
re- O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
a O
computer O
. O

It O
's O
the O
inside O
that O
is O
truly O
wonderful O
. O

Right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
I O
asked O
of O
it O
, O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you O
're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
( O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
) O
. O

Frustrated O
I O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2- O
3 O
days O
for O
turnaround O
time O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
as O
a O
problem O
. O

I O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
, O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
! O

It O
can O
not O
save O
the O
correct O
date O
and O
time O
I O
set O
. O

My O
problem O
was O
with O
DELL B-AS
Customer I-AS
Service I-AS
. O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O
desktop O
, O
and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O
, O
which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
or O
the O
motherboard B-AS
. O

They O
told O
me O
it O
was O
my O
loss O
even O
though O
it O
was O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
what O
I O
've O
done O
. O

Laptop O
is O
advertised O
as O
a O
15 B-AS
'' I-AS
but O
the O
casing B-AS
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a O
17 B-AS
'' I-AS
. O

It O
was O
always O
getting O
froze O
up O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
trying O
to O
decide O
on O
another O
Dell O
model O
. O

HOW O
DOES O
THE O
POWER B-AS
SUPPLY I-AS
NOT O
WORK O
! O
! O
! O

However O
the O
frozen O
screens B-AS
kept O
happening O
. O

Great O
OS B-AS
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor B-AS
speed I-AS
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt B-AS
port I-AS
. O

Clear O
picture B-AS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

I O
have O
never O
really O
been O
big O
on O
downloading O
anything O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
too O
worried O
about O
getting O
a O
virus O
, O
plus O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
protected O
by O
Norton B-AS
. O

It O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
, O
making O
transporting B-AS
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
. O

My O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
loaded I-AS
Norton I-AS
Firewall I-AS
/ I-AS
Security I-AS
program I-AS
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
buttons I-AS
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

I O
now O
own O
another O
Hewlitt O
Packard O
. O

They O
are O
n't O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
on O
the O
cheap O
side O
, O
laptop O
speaking O
. O

They O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
I O
return O
it O
within O
15 O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

Obviously O
we O
both O
got O
new O
Macs O
. O

Unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O
inconvenienced O
with O
a O
non O
working O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O
attachment O
so O
small O
. O

Supplied B-AS
software I-AS
: O
The O
software B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
this O
machine O
is O
greatly O
welcomed O
compared O
to O
what O
Windows B-AS
comes O
with O
. O

I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
Vista B-AS
, O
yet O
I O
know O
Vista B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
Acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
Vista B-AS
( O
I O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
) O
. O

We O
use O
the O
built B-AS
in I-AS
tools I-AS
often O
, O
iTunes B-AS
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iPhone O
. O

Took O
several O
hours O
with O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
before O
I O
could O
even O
start O
the O
PC O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

The O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty B-AS
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
recommend O
the O
HP O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrentys B-AS
. O

Would O
buy O
100 O
more O
of O
these O
if O
I O
could O
. O

Either O
way O
the O
entire O
thing O
was O
just O
a O
joke O
, O
a O
complete O
rip O
off O
! O

This O
laptop O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
little O
peice O
of O
machinery O
I O
have O
owned O
outside O
of O
the O
Iphone O
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
back O
in O
yet O
again O
except O
this O
time O
they O
kept O
it O
to O
send O
into O
their O
Geek O
Squad O
headquarters O
. O

It O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

I O
think O
I O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

They O
freeze O
all O
the O
time O
. O

My O
friends O
or O
children O
use O
that O
when O
they O
need O
to O
borrow O
the O
Net O
= O
) O
When O
I O
out O
grow O
this O
Meaning O
when O
its O
old O
and O
my O
oldest O
child O
is O
ready O
for O
one O
she O
will O
get O
this O
one O
ANd O
I O
will O
be O
buying O
only O
TOSHIBA O
! O

The O
ease O
in O
which O
you O
set O
everything O
up O
is O
such O
that O
a O
child O
could O
do O
it O
. O

Overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
I O
use O
. O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery B-AS
... O

Eventually O
my O
battery B-AS
would O
n't O
charge O
, O
so O
unless O
I O
had O
it O
plugged O
in O
it O
would O
n't O
even O
power O
on O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
more O
like O
week O
one O
. O

It O
was O
secure O
and O
easy O
to O
navigate B-AS
. O

If O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
my O
apple O
items O
I O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
one O
of O
my O
local O
stores O
and O
they O
work O
on O
correcting O
it O
right O
there O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
really O
happy O
that O
I O
waited O
to O
buy O
, O
because O
this O
thing O
kicks O
a O
$ O
$ O
! O

I O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery B-AS
once O
, O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O
laptop O
with O
semi O
- O
decent O
gaming B-AS
capabilities O
. O

It O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
with O
2 O
buttons O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
is O
better O
than O
the O
Toshiba O
, O
too O
. O

BUT O
there O
's O
this O
application B-AS
called O
Boot B-AS
Camp I-AS
which O
allows O
you O
to O
add O
another O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
like O
Windows B-AS
. O

, O
Applications B-AS
respond O
immediately O
( O
not O
like O
the O
tired O
MS B-AS
applications I-AS
) O
. O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
just O
pick O
up O
and O
use B-AS
- O
- O
It O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
get O

the O

OS I-AS

Lightweight O
and O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
beautiful O

It O
is O

Desktop O
Replacement O

No O

up I-AS
was O
terrific O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bad O
experience O
but O
i O
played O
down O
its O
importance O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
. O

Excellent O
LED B-AS
monitor I-AS
and O
well O
equipped O
. O

I O
eventually O
did O
the O
migration O
from O
my O
iMac B-AS
backup I-AS
disc I-AS
which O
uses O
USB B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
stuck O
w/ O
a O
broken O
computer O
. O

I O
do O
transcription O
work O
on O
the O
side O
, O
and O
the O
flatline B-AS
keyboard I-AS
makes O
typing O
quick O
and O
easy O
as O
well O
. O

Until O
I O
bought O
the O
Dell O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
( O
size B-AS
, O
software B-AS
, O
options O
, O
hardware B-AS
) O
and O
purchase O
the O
best O
deal O
you O
could O
find O
. O

but O
other O
then O
that O
I O
would O
give O
this O
product O
a O
4 O
in O
hafe O
stars O
. O

So O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
install O
one O
of O
the O
3 O
printers O
I O
have O
in O
my O
house O
so O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
print O
. O

Treat O
yourself O
to O
a O
more O
expensive O
, O
long O
- O
lasting O
laptop O
of O
quality B-AS
like O
a O
Sony O
, O
Apple O
, O
or O
Toshiba O
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

Could O
n't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
said O
, O
about O
10 O
% O
of O
their O
products O
fail O
. O

Then O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
failed O
; O

I O
could O
not O
find O
a O
phone O
number O
anywhere O
to O
call O
an O
actual O
live O
person O
for O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
and O
had O
to O
result O
the O
their O
online B-AS
chat I-AS
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
( O
Refurbished O
) O
again O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
and O
if O
the O
fancy O
webcam B-AS
breaks O
guess O
who O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
to O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
? O

She O
told O
me O
flatly O
, O
`` O
It O
's O
like O
that O
one O
. O

I O
guess O
he O
was O
the O
technical B-AS
person I-AS
. O

Being O
a O
PC O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
, O
it O
's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
OS B-AS
of O
a O
Mac O
but O
I O
'm O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

Overall O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
perfect O
, O
great O
computer O
, O
my O
daughter O
loves O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

After O
3 O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
the O
laptop O
just O
died O
. O

HP O
said O
I O
had O
done O
the O
damage O
. O

This O
computer O
I O
used O
daily O
nice O
compact O
design B-AS
. O

i O
love O
the O
size B-AS
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O
games B-AS
on O
it O
. O

Worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
company O
nor O
the O
toshiba O
brand O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
because O
I O
've O
put O
more O
into O
it O
then O
it O
is O
worth O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard B-AS
. O

I O
dual O
boot O
with O
Linux B-AS
and O
that O
other O
security B-AS
- I-AS
prone I-AS
OS I-AS
and O
it O
performs B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

taking O
it O
back O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
of O
purchase O

I O
also O
purchased O
Office B-AS
Max I-AS
's I-AS
`` I-AS
Max I-AS
Assurance I-AS
'' I-AS
with O
the O
`` O
no O
lemon O
'' O
clause O
. O

A O
cheaper O
price B-AS
should O
not O
equal O
a O
`` O
cheap O
'' O
product O
. O

I O
did O
contact O
HP O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
I O
am O
. O

the O
internet O
can O
be O
an O
scary O
place O
its O
up O
to O
you O
on O
what O
you O
do O
with O
it O
. O

This O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
is O
great O
! O

It O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam B-AS
, O
and O
Skype B-AS
works O
very O
well O
. O

I O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
this O
product O
can O
not O
display O
websites O
that O
contain O
Flash O
. O

( O
The O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
is O
the O
motherboard B-AS
chip I-AS
that O
lets O
the O
CPU B-AS
talk O
to O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O
) O

I O
edit O
and O
burn O
to O
DVD O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
, O
so O
I O
obviously O
could O
not O
live O
with O
a O
non O
- O
functioning O
drive B-AS
. O

I O
had O
my O
IWORKS B-AS
, O
Itunes B-AS
, O
Email O
, O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
never O
held O
a O
charge B-AS
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B-AS
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
've O
been O
Dell O
fan O
for O
more O
than O
fifteen O
years O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
macbook O
pros O
since O
2005 O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
yet O
! O

But O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

I'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher O
- O
end O
laptops O
, O
but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget B-AS
and O
the O
features B-AS
I O
need O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B-AS
. O

I O
would O
totally O
recommend O
any O
other O
laptop O
over O
this O
pile O
of O
grabage O
. O

Some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
blurry O
, O
some O
days O
it O
appears O
that O
it O
's O
raining O
on O
my O
nice O
desktop O
background O
of O
a O
lake O
and O
mountains O
. O

It O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

I O
've O
always O
owned O
a O
PC O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
MacBook O
to O
see O
what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
any O
high O
tech O
stuff O
on O
it O
, O
just O
write O
papers O
, O
check O
mail O
, O
and O
sometimes O
play O
games O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
reccomend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
. O

I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
! O

With O
what O
I O
paid O
for O
this O
computer O
it O
should O
have O
had O
everything O
on O
it O
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
I O
've O
noticed O
an O
electronic B-AS
fuzz I-AS
sound I-AS
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone B-AS
jack I-AS
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
. O

My O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
- O
- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
: O
Do O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
. O

) O
And O
printing O
from O
either O
word B-AS
processor I-AS
is O
an O
adventure O
. O

It O
's O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
'm O
thinking O
I O
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery B-AS
or O
something O
. O

I O
am O
enjoying O
it O
and O
the O
quality B-AS
it O
provides O
is O
great O
! O

Then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
, O
my O
left B-AS
`` I-AS
mouse I-AS
'' I-AS
button I-AS
snapped O
! O

This O
was O
an O
update O
from O
an O
early O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

I O
can O
not O
even O
read O
what O
I O
am O
writing O
half O
of O
the O
time O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

The O
# O
1 O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

High O
price B-AS
tag I-AS
, O
however O
. O

Not O
even O
safe B-AS
mode I-AS
boots O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
the O
ideal O
college O
companion O
. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
another O
computer O
, O
I O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O
acer O
one O
computer O
. O

I O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
yet O
again O
. O

My O
wife O
also O
has O
problems O
with O
her O
Asus O
- O
different O
model O
. O

seriously O
why O
have O
n't O
they O
just O
replaced O
it O
by O
now O
. O

Sure O
hope O
Best O
Buy O
will O
replace O
it O
asap O
. O

Kind O
of O
annoying O
, O
but O
I O
still O
love O
the O
laptop O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

When O
I O
am O
next O
to O
my O
router O
on O
my O
HP O
I O
get O
full B-AS
service I-AS
, O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
I O
get O
3 O
bars O
. O

Great O
battery B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
, O
display B-AS
. O

It O
has O
no O
camera B-AS
but O
, O
I O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

By O
Air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
Me O
. O

My O
daughter O
uses O
it O
for O
games B-AS
, O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
pictures O
and O
music O
. O

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B-AS
! O

The O
computer O
will O
constantly O
be O
getting O
hot O
and O
burning O
your O
leg O
unless O
you O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
taking O
off O
the O
entire O
back O
of O
it O
just O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
fan B-AS
. O

I O
would O
never O
tell O
anyone O
to O
buy O
one O
either O
. O

Honestly O
, O
this O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
. O

Bigger O
HD B-AS
, O
better O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
, O
and O
a O
bid O
HD B-AS
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

It O
's O
very O
annoying O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
webcam B-AS
though O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
! O

This O
is O
my O
first O
personal O
Satellite O
purchase O
but O
had O
very O
good O
experience O
through O
previous O
Satellite O
work O
issued O
laptops O
. O

But O
Sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O
it O
back O
and O
be O
charged O
for O
adding B-AS
the I-AS
bluetooth I-AS
an O
additional O
seventy O
something O
dollars O
. O

it O
might O
be O
something O
deep O
within O
Windows B-AS
, O
for O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
create O
a O
disk B-AS
image I-AS
on O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

It O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
PC O
laptops O
, O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
, O
security B-AS
, O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
pricetag B-AS
. O

Hard B-AS
disk I-AS
- O
The O
new O
editions O
gives O
you O
more O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
space I-AS
( O
500GB O
instead O
of O
320GB O
) O
but O
time O
has O
taught O
me O
never O
to O
trust O
an O
internal B-AS
hard I-AS
disk I-AS
. O

Apple O
is O
always O
great O
about O
the O
aesthetics B-AS
of O
things O
, O
they O
always O
come O
up O
with O
good O
looking O
products O
. O

Since O
I O
purchased O
my O
Toshiba O
netbook O
, O
I O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
I O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

It O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
DIES O
( O
like O
a O
PC O
, O
maybe O
worse O
) O
and O
I O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

I O
was O
even O
able O
to O
uninstall O
McAffe O
and O
install O
one O
of O
my O
Symantec O
licenses O
with O
a O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

Needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery B-AS
, O
More O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
Hrs O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
Dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
I O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company B-AS
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left B-AS
mouse I-AS
key I-AS
broke O
and O
it O
costed B-AS
$ O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

This O
laptop O
has O
left O
me O
with O
a O
HORRIBLE O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
for O
Acer O
brand O
products O
. O

So O
I O
called O
, O
AGAIN O
. O

It O
weighed B-AS
like O
seven B-AS
pounds I-AS
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

AND O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer B-AS
( O
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion O
/ O
offer O
going O
, O
of O
course O
) O
! O

Wireless B-AS
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O
for O
me O
, O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O
. O

However O
, O
my O
girlfriend O
realized O
that O
the O
netbook O
's O
hinge B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
loose O
( O
when O
you O
open O
or O
close O
the O
LCD B-AS
) O
. O

Numerous O
problems O
over O
the O
next O
3 O
weeks O
until O
I O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
and O
had O
to O
send O
the O
PC O
back O
to O
HP O
. O

As O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
, O
, O
about O
4 O
inches O
across O
is O
hardly O
visible O
. O

Waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

WIth O
the O
upgraded B-AS
memory I-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
never O
has O
an O
issue O
running B-AS
many O
many O
applications B-AS
at O
once O
! O

The O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
. O

Called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
Acer O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
software B-AS
but O
for O
$ O
$ O
$ O
we O
can O
help O
you O
'' O
I O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software B-AS
involved O
in O
booting B-AS
. O

THIS O
is O
what O
a O
laptop O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

the O
size B-AS
of O
has O
actually O
help O
me O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me O
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O
full O
backpack O
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O
table O
is O
always O
so O
space O
consuming O
. O

Call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs B-AS
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

however O
, O
they O
were O
kind O
enough O
