So O
it O
was O
only O
about O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
. O

The O
difference O
in O
the O
Apple B-AS
keyboard I-AS
from O
a O
PC B-AS
's I-AS
keyboard I-AS
took O
a O
bit O
of O
tim O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
but O
overall O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
! O

Even O
if O
Apple O
replaces O
whatever O
needs O
replacing O
I O
wonder O
if O
, O
since O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
doubling O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
each O
time O
it O
's O
`` O
like O
new O
, O
'' O
I O
might O
have O
8 O
months O
next O
time O
. O

But O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
is O
not O
available O
24 O
/ O
7 O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
Macbook O
Pro O
if O
you O
want O
the O
best O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
a O
PC O
that O
ca O
n't O
support O
a O
cell O
phone O
is O
less O
than O
useless O
! O

I O
have O
used O
PC O
's O
and O
converting O
to O
this O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
easy O
. O

I O
can O
throw O
anything O
at O
it O
( O
and O
I O
do O
) O
, O
Pictures O
, O
video O
editing O
, O
schoolwork O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
PC O
, O
with O
a O
little O
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
this O
OS B-AS
! O

I O
upgraded O
the O
memory B-AS
and O
replaced O
the O
base O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
to O
Win B-AS
7 I-AS
Home I-AS
, O
and O
it O
runs B-AS
just O
fine O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

A O
MONTH O
LATER O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
OS B-AS
( I-AS
Vista I-AS
) I-AS
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
anything O
from O
HP O
again O
! O

Mom O
, O
Dad O
, O
Brother O
, O
sister O
, O
You O
name O
it O
! O

it O
has O
times O
were O
it O
freezes O
for O
10 O
seconds O
and O
then O
starts O
again O
. O

Loaded O
with O
bloatware B-AS
. O

I O
am O
constantly O
trying O
to O
uninstall O
programs B-AS
, O
clean O
cookies O
, O
and O
delete O
unused O
files O
. O

I O
could O
have O
purchased O
a O
cheap O
computer O
to O
do O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
now O
! O

It O
's O
not O
a O
wear O
- O
and O
- O
tear O
issue O
, O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
they O
CA O
N'T O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service B-AS
and O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
. O

Toshiba O
knows O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
but O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
it O
. O

Processor B-AS
- O
When O
compared O
to O
my O
3 O
week O
old O
Early O
2011 O
edition O
there O
I O
barely O
experience O
any O
difference O
in O
performance B-AS
( O
2.3 O
GHz O
v O
/ O
s O
2.4 O
GHz O
) O
. O

My O
husband O
got O
me O
this O
for O
Chrismas O
after O
getting O
me O
a O
very O
expensve O
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
work B-AS
after O
2 O
days O
. O

in O
May O
I O
started O
having O
problems O
with O
the O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
not O
working O
. O

But O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
my O
part O
would O
be O
shipped O
nor O
could O
they O
tell O
me O
where O
to O
buy O
it O
ON O
THEIR O
WEBSITE O
! O
! O
! O

I O
had O
this O
computer O
for O
one O
month O
and O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

Love O
the O
stability B-AS
of O
the O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
and O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

So O
i O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anyone O
buying O
this O
computer O

It O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
any O
software B-AS
installed O
outside O
of O
windows B-AS
media I-AS
, O
but O
for O
the O
price B-AS
, O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
condition O
and O
the O
overall O
product O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
since O
I O
bought O
my O
Mac O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
ever O
go O
back O
to O
any O
Windows B-AS
. O

The O
13 O
'' O
Macbook O
Pro O
just O
fits O
in O
my O
budget B-AS
and O
with O
free O
shipping B-AS
and O
no O
tax O
to O
CA O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price B-AS
we O
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O
product O
. O

I O
should O
have O
bought O
one O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

Files O
as O
well O
would O
become O
lost O
, O
deleted O
or O
corrupted O
. O

A O
coupla O
months O
later O
, O
they O
change O
my O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

The O
speakers B-AS
on O
it O
are O
useless O
too O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
. O

I O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
almost O
zero O
viruses O
and O
spyware O
problems O
! O

Seriously O
considering O
a O
larger O
laptop O
to O
replace O
the O
Dell O

Features B-AS
such O
as O
the O
Dashboard B-AS
( O
allows O
you O
to O
view O
frequently O
used O
tools O
like O
a O
calculator O
, O
weather O
forecast O
, O
movie O
times O
, O
calendar O
, O
computer O
post O
its O
etc O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS
. O

Took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-AS
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-AS
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

- O
Touchpad B-AS
will O
take O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B-AS
broad I-AS
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

And O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
writing O
, O
editing B-AS
is O
a O
problem O
since O
there O
is O
no O
forward O
delete B-AS
key I-AS
. O

She O
told O
me O
flatly O
, O
`` O
It O
's O
like O
that O
one O
. O

It O
Was O
a O
great O
deal O
after O
all O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
fun O
using O
the O
laptop O
now O
, O
still O
learning O
the O
Apple B-AS
navigation I-AS
, O
but O
is O
fun O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
apps B-AS
. O

That O
's O
very O
possible O
, O
but O
since O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
Windows B-AS
XP I-AS
drivers I-AS
for O
the O
sound B-AS
card I-AS
in O
this O
machine O
, O
I O
was O
stuck O
until O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
came O
out O
. O

If O
so O
, O
you O
may O
be O
having O
similar O
problems O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
spend O
gobs O
of O
money O
on O
some O
inefficient O
virus B-AS
program I-AS
that O
needs O
to O
be O
updated O
every O
month O
and O
that O
constantly O
drains O
your O
wallet O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
even O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

Do O
n't O
buy O
this O
model O
. O

After O
3 O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
the O
laptop O
just O
died O
. O

not O
the O
day O
received O
. O

Amazing O
machine O
. O

Support B-AS
has O
been O
lackluster O
and O
now O
I O
just O
want O
a O
refund O
. O

SO O
? O
HOW O
CAN O
YOU O
SOLVE O
IT O
? O
C'mon O
, O
I O
just O
bought O
the O
netbook O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
. O

It O
has O
served O
my O
needs O
quite O
nicely O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

I O
am O
stuck O
with O
a O
laptop O
that O
I O
can O
not O
do O
very O
much O
with O
. O

Still O
pretty O
pricey O
, O
but O
I O
've O
been O
putting O
off O
money O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
little O
Macbook O
Fund O
, O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
use O
it O
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
HP O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
recovery B-AS
disk I-AS
because O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
come O
with O
one O
and O
completely O
redo O
it O
all O
. O

It O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
everything O
I O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
more O
. O

Then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

Memory B-AS
is O
upgradable O
. O

Love O
it O
so O
far O
. O

And O
that O
probably O
explains O
why O
I O
've O
already O
had O
my O
SATA B-AS
controller I-AS
go O
bad O
within O
a O
year O
of O
buying O
it O
. O

None O
of O
the O
techs B-AS
at I-AS
HP I-AS
knew O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

My O
parents O
bought O
it O
for O
me O
as O
a O
graduation O
gift O
, O
and O
i O
'm O
totally O
( O
almost O
kind O
of O
maybe O
definitely O
) O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

I O
would O
easly O
reccomend O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

Luckily O
, O
Dell O
said O
they O
would O
replace O
my O
laptop O
with O
a O
new O
one O
, O
but O
instead O
I O
got O
a O
refund O
and O
bought O
a O
mac O
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
I O
've O
had O
terrible O
experiences O
with O
HP O
. O

My O
Toshiba O
did O
not O
have O
sound B-AS
on O
everything O
, O
just O
certain O
things O
. O

Many O
of O
my O
classmates O
computers O
hard B-AS
drives I-AS
crashed O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
also O
relatively O
good O
. O

Pay O
attention O
to O
the O
specs B-AS
if O
you O
want O
these O
options O
. O

Best O
thing O
is O
I O
can O
use O
existing O
32 O
bit O
old O
programs B-AS
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
, O
which O
generally O
felt O
okay O
even O
for O
someone O
used O
to O
a O
desktop B-AS
keyboard I-AS
, O
now O
looks O
terrible O
. O

I O
love O
this O
computer O
. O

Call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

Recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
framed O
by O
half O
- O
to O
a O
full O
- O
inch O
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O
unnecessary O
, O
reduces O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
and O
increases O
the O
bulk B-AS
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
on O
this O
computer O
are O
also O
stellar O
- O
very O
clear O
and O
vivid O
. O

Images B-AS
are O
crisp O
and O
clean O
. O

Sadly O
Apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
MacBook O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
Pros O
. O

I O
eventually O
did O
the O
migration O
from O
my O
iMac B-AS
backup I-AS
disc I-AS
which O
uses O
USB B-AS
. O

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O
design B-AS
flaw O
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
doubt O
you O
'd O
be O
overly O
disappointed O
if O
you O
invest O
in O
this O
machine O
. O

Now O
mainboard B-AS
is O
broken O
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

I O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
yet O
again O
. O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O
desktop O
, O
and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O
, O
which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
or O
the O
motherboard B-AS
. O

I O
would O
rate O
this O
computer O
at O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
considering O
it O
has O
a O
short O
life B-AS
span I-AS
I O
can O
only O
give O
it O
1 O
and O
implore O
anyone O
looking O
at O
laptops O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
machine O
. O

One O
night O
I O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
I O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
GUI B-AS
, O
screen B-AS
all O
dark O
, O
power B-AS
light I-AS
steady O
, O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
light I-AS
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

After O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service B-AS
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
. O

I O
can O
not O
even O
imaging O
going O
back O
to O
a O
PC O
after O
using O
this O
wonderful O
computer O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

I O
fine O
Apple O
MC373LL/ O
A O
2.66GHz O
15 O
'' O
Macboook O
Pro O
Notebook O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
laptop O
computer O
when O
on O
the O
go O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
much O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
toy O
called O
an O
IPad O
. O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
. O

apple O
and O
quess O
what O
, O
you O
have O
to O
send O
the O
whole O
laptop O
in O
, O
too O
bad O
, O
so O
sad O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
. O

When O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
immediately O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
heavy O
and O
thick O
and O
not O
really O
attractive O
. O

But O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

Bigger O
HD B-AS
, O
better O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
, O
and O
a O
bid O
HD B-AS
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
reports O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
, O
it O
's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
and O
the O
response B-AS
for O
the O
computing O
she O
's O
doing O
( O
Internet B-AS
focused I-AS
activity I-AS
: O
mail O
, O
research O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
is O
excellent O
; O

You O
know O
, O
using O
the O
computer O
should O
be O
fun O
, O
not O
aggrevation O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
are O
playing B-AS
games I-AS
or O
working O
with O
photos O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
holds O
up O
well O
, O
it O
's O
built B-AS
very O
solidly O
, O
and O
runs B-AS
fast O
. O

Besides O
the O
great O
look B-AS
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

Hieroglyphics O
are O
quite O
common O
. O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
. O

Sure O
it O
has O
the O
one B-AS
touch I-AS
keys I-AS
but O
that O
was O
the O
best O
feature B-AS
of O
the O
computer O
. O

- O
4 O
RAM B-AS
slots I-AS
, O
2 O
HDD B-AS
Bays I-AS
* O
, O
16GB B-AS
RAM I-AS
support I-AS
- O
No O
Wireless B-AS
Issues O
, O
at O
least O
for O
me O
. O

My O
only O
other O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
. O

I O
went O
from O
BestBuy O
to O
Dell O
, O
Windows O
to O
Apple O
. O

They O
went O
through O
asking O
me O
open O
up O
various O
components O
, O
taking O
battery B-AS
out O
, O
hard B-AS
disk I-AS
apart O
, O
and O
after O
2 O
hours O
on O
phone O
could O
not O
fix O
it O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
started O
using O
Google B-AS
Chrome I-AS
, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
, O
but O
it O
freezes O
too O
sometimes O
. O

That O
seemed O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
, O
till O
I O
wrote O
an O
article O
with O
semicolons O
in O
it O
. O

I O
have O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
online O
sources O
to O
help O
me O
but O
think O
that O
I O
would O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
quicker O
if O
I O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
class O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
purchase O
Spy B-AS
ware I-AS
or O
Nortell B-AS
for O
privacy O
protection O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
takes O
some O
getting O
use O
to O
, O
because O
it O
is O
smaller O
than O
the O
laptop O
. O

Everything O
else O
just O
install O
and O
go O
. O

It O
's O
color B-AS
is O
even O
cool O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
sometimes O
the O
whole O
charger B-AS
unit I-AS
will O
decide O
not O
to O
work O
entirely O
. O

I O
was O
taught O
to O
use O
Photoshop B-AS
and O
was O
amazed O
. O

I O
would O
rather O
spend O
my O
money O
on O
a O
computer O
that O
costs B-AS
more O
then O
a O
Toshiba O
that O
is O
n't O
good O
at O
all O
. O

Wasted O
me O
at O
least O
8 O
hours O
of O
installation B-AS
time I-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
a O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
out O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
in O
style B-AS
, O
speed B-AS
and O
just O
cool O
factor O
. O

With O
the O
macbook O
pro O
it O
comes O
with O
free O
securitysoftware B-AS
to O
protect O
it O
from O
viruses O
and O
other O
intrusive O
things O
from O
downloads O
and O
internet O
surfing O
or O
emails O
. O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
am O
stuck O
. O

THIS O
IS O
MY O
SECOND O
MAC O
BOOK O
PRO O
. O

The O
feature B-AS
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
I O
need O
. O

I O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
Mac O
before O
; O

But O
the O
quality B-AS
, O
in O
general O
was O
less O
than O
the O
worth O
of O
the O
cheap O
laptop O
. O

It O
was O
always O
getting O
froze O
up O
. O

It O
is O
in O
the O
best O
condition O
and O
has O
a O
really O
high O
quality B-AS
. O

the O
mouse B-AS
buttons I-AS
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

English O
must O
have O
been O
his O
third O
or O
fourth O
language O
. O

If O
it O
's O
not O
shipped O
on O
the O
next O
business O
day O
, O
called O
on O
a O
Friday O
they O
are O
closed O
on O
weekends O
, O
what O
was O
the O
next O
step O
. O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B-AS
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
. O

I O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
Dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
I O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company B-AS
. O

Overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

Going O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
service B-AS
today O
. O

It O
does O
run O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
that O
is O
a O
negligible O
concern O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
it O
has O
shit O
gigs B-AS
. O

Another O
two O
weeks O
later O
and O
it O
was O
back O
in O
my O
possession O
. O

My O
wireless O
provider O
confirmed O
my O
home O
internet O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
any O
connections O
I O
turn O
on O
should O
work O
. O

It O
had O
a O
cooling B-AS
system I-AS
malfunction O
after O
10 O
minutes O
of O
general O
use B-AS
, O
and O
would O
not O
move O
past O
this O
error O
. O

Great O
OS B-AS
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor B-AS
speed I-AS
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt B-AS
port I-AS
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
only O
last O
1.5 O
- O
2.0 O
hrs O
when O
not O
plugged O
in O
. O

Dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
? O
Then O
it O
will O
not O
be O
a O
newly O
manufactured O
set O
like O
before O
. O

I O
am O
definitely O
sold O
, O
and O
not O
going O
back O
to O
PCs O
for O
home O
use O
! O

One O
of O
the O
wonderful O
things O
about O
Macs O
is O
that O
they O
are O
virus O
free O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
. O

I O
love O
how O
easy O
every O
thing O
is O
to O
do O
on O
my O
Apple O
products O
. O

Each O
time O
taking O
about O
1 O
day O
or O
so O
. O

still O
testing O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
as O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
, O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
upgrade O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
call O
the O
support B-AS
line I-AS
at O
all O
. O

This O
has O
happened O
three O
times O
so O
far O
. O

the O
headphone B-AS
and O
mic B-AS
jack I-AS
are O
in O
front O
of O
touch B-AS
- I-AS
pad I-AS
making O
the O
touch B-AS
- I-AS
pad I-AS
hard O
to O
use O
when O
using O
headphones B-AS
/ O
mic B-AS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
laptop O
was O
designed O
for O
right O
handed O
person O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
huge O
change O
in O
that O
my O
mac O
runs B-AS
pretty O
fast O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
PC O
. O

I O
visited O
the O
Apple O
Store O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
17- O
inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

That O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

They O
break O
down O
just O
as O
often O
as O
PCs O
do O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
viruses O
, O
is O
because O
no O
one O
makes O
viruses O
for O
them O
, O
they O
're O
not O
better O
in O
any O
way O
, O
they O
are O
worse O
, O
try O
finding O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
programs I-AS
for I-AS
a I-AS
Mac I-AS
, O
they O
do O
n't O
exist O
. O

Apparently O
under O
the O
screen B-AS
there O
are O
2 O
little O
screws O
and O
when O
the O
screen B-AS
gets O
moved O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
they O
come O
loose O
. O

It O
's O
priced B-AS
very O
reasonable O
and O
works B-AS
very O
well O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
. O

Apple B-AS
care I-AS
included O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
. O

The O
minute O
you O
fire O
it O
up O
it O
's O
all O
good O
, O
very O
easy O
user B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard B-AS
. O

After O
that O
I O
turned O
to O
email O
in O
my O
next O
vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
warranty B-AS
was O
still O
valid O
. O

MacBook O
Notebooks O
quickly O
die O
out O
because O
of O
their O
short O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
many O
background O
programs B-AS
that O
run O
without O
the O
user O
's O
knowlede O
. O

I O
was O
constantly O
having O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
computer O
after O
doing O
updates O
. O

If O
only O
Bill O
Gates O
would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O
MS O
would O
do O
a O
better O
job O
. O

The O
only O
objection O
I O
have O
is O
that O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
system I-AS
is O
a O
starter O
and O
charges O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
9 O
months O
and O
it O
is O
already O
a O
$ O
250 O
loss O
. O

The O
great O
18 O
month O
same O
as O
cash O
financing O
and O
Advance O
Protection O
Plan O
which O
includes O
accidents O
like O
spills O
. O

The O
advantages O
of O
owning O
'a O
'mac O
are O
numerous O
. O

Does O
a O
great O
job O
with O
video O
shot O
on O
a O
Canon O
5D O
MKII O
. O

It O
is O
fast O
and O
i O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
internet B-AS
connection I-AS
or O
any O
other O
problems O
. O

All O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Very O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
well O
made O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
back O
to O
DELL O
. O

the O
last O
time O
we O
took O
it O
to O
get O
fixed O
the O
guy O
said O
that O
most O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
reppative O
problem O
and O
will O
keep O
happeneing O
so O
hopefully O
we O
can O
get O
a O
new O
one O
very O
soon O
! O

I O
was O
sorly O
disapointed O
to O
discover O
that O
HP O
( O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
reputable O
company O
) O
would O
n't O
honor O
the O
warrenty B-AS
when O
the O
fan B-AS
blade I-AS
fell O
apart O
. O

compresses O
itself O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

This O
process O
continued O
to O
repeat O
itself O
until O
the O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
4 O
times O
and O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
replaced O
3 O
times O
. O

When O
the O
computer O
has O
been O
on O
for O
several O
minutes O
, O
it O
will O
occasionaly O
just O
go O
off O
by O
itself O
. O

But O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
( O
the O
company O
) O
would O
not O
and O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
my O
problem O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
I O
have O
decided O
to O
NEVER O
purchase O
another O
HP O
product O
( O
my O
five O
year O
old O
Compaq O
) O
lasted O
5 O
- O
years O
before O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
crashed O
. O

And O
at O
one O
point O
, O
they O
blame O
me O
for O
installing O
a O
bad O
memory B-AS
stick I-AS
when O
I O
upgrade O
my O
memory B-AS
for O
the O
first O
time O
during O
my O
purchase O
of O
the O
laptop O
( O
I O
bought O
the O
memory B-AS
stick I-AS
they O
recomended O
) O
. O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
to O
look B-AS
at O
and O
the O
keys B-AS
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O
. O

If O
you O
could O
stretch O
by O
a O
few O
100 O
dollars O
I O
highly O
recommend O
you O
should O
replace O
your O
Windows O
laptop O
with O
this O
one O
. O

tosiba O
has O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
my O
llast O
computer O
was O
an O
acer O
. O

Its O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
and O
the O
top O
service B-AS
from O
Apple O
- O
be O
it O
their O
phone B-AS
assistance I-AS
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius B-AS
bar I-AS
- O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
I O
suggest O
going O
to O
apple.com O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B-AS
. O

We O
both O
recently O
got O
new O
laptops O
. O

very O
convenient O
when O
you O
travel O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
... O

Meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
for O
this O
senior O
to O
carry O
without O
affecting O
my O
arthritis O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
many O
PC O
laptops O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

They O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty B-AS
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
Toshiba O
. O

The O
apple O
systems O
are O
over O
priced O
luxurys O
that O
ar O
n't O
worth O
what O
they O
are O
being O
charged O
for O
, O
this O
model O
's O
specifications B-AS
are O
far O
from O
being O
impressive O
and O
they O
only O
thing O
you O
get O
out O
of O
this O
is O
the O
apple O
name O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
! O

It O
's O
also O
very O
energy O
efficient O
, O
running O
on O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
power O
it O
takes O
to O
run O
a O
60 O
Watt O
lightbulb O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
I O
am O
no O
Microsoft O
hater O
, O
I O
've O
just O
managed O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
much O
bigger O
Apple O
fan O
because O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

The O
sound B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
quiet O
if O
you O
're O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
this O
can O
easily O
be O
overcome O
with O
a O
decent O
pair O
of O
head O
phones O
. O

After O
2 O
months O
of O
complaints O
, O
Asus O
finally O
sent O
the O
right O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
to O
my O
techies B-AS
. O

It O
has O
worked O
fine O
. O

Purchased O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

My O
husband O
purchased O
a O
laptop O
at O
the O
same O
time O
for O
about O
$ O
300 O
less O
( O
he O
got O
a O
pc O
) O
. O

This O
is O
basically O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
or O
used O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
the O
other O
performance B-AS
specs I-AS
and O
while O
comparing O
, O
I O
took O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
these O
features B-AS
were O
standard O
. O

I O
dual O
boot O
with O
Linux B-AS
and O
that O
other O
security B-AS
- I-AS
prone I-AS
OS I-AS
and O
it O
performs B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

With O
notes O
saying O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

got O
another O
1 O
, O
and O
same O
issue O
. O

We O
use O
the O
built B-AS
in I-AS
tools I-AS
often O
, O
iTunes B-AS
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iPhone O
. O

Temperatures B-AS
on O
the O
outside O
were O
alright O
but O
i O
did O
not O
track O
in O
Core B-AS
Processing I-AS
Unit I-AS
temperatures I-AS
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

When O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
Best O
Buy O
I O
asked O
them O
if O
they O
were O
seriously O
trying O
to O
drive O
me O
insane O
! O

One O
drawback O
I O
noticed O
was O
sound B-AS
quality I-AS
via I-AS
USB I-AS
. O

Otherwise O
, O
I O
love O
it O
! O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
G4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
purchased O
this O
computer O
. O

They O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
, O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

return O
it O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

It O
is O
sleek O
, O
smooth O
, O
and O
lightweight O
. O

I O
acually O
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
with O
the O
Nvidia B-AS
grafics I-AS
card I-AS

Blue O
screen O
first O
month O

I O
was O
also O
able O
to O
install O
and O
use O
my O
Photoshop B-AS
and O
AfterEffects B-AS
programs I-AS
easily O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
and O
screen B-AS
are O
stunning O
and O
although O
I O
was O
a O
PC O
person O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
understand O
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

I O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
. O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eyes O
without O
looking O
too O
much O
like O
an O
Alienware O
gaming O
machine O

But O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

Have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer B-AS
support I-AS
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me O
that O
is O
a O
great O
thing O
, O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
PC O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
a O
satellite B-AS
card I-AS
which O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

The O
lesson O
learned O
here O
is O
: O
It O
does O
not O
pay O
to O
by O
this O
loyal O
to O
any O
brand O
, O
since O
all O
of O
them O
are O
there O
to O
simply O
to O
make O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
, O
and O
in O
this O
day O
and O
age O
, O
the O
customer O
no O
longer O
is O
right O
all O
the O
times O
. O

This O
is O
now O
my O
3rd O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
I O
really O
honestly O
love O
it O
! O

Then O
HP O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware B-AS
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

I O
have O
used O
both O
PCs O
and O
Macs O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
really O
really O
love O
my O
Mac O
Book O
Pro O
. O

There O
is O
a O
small O
red O
circle O
next O
to O
it O
with O
a O
x O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
when O
I O
click O
on O
it O
it O
says O
: O
`` O
Consider O
replacing O
your O
battery B-AS
`` O
and O
it O
does O
not O
hold O
full O
charge B-AS

Sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size B-AS

The O
Awesomest O
of O
the O
awesomest O

Though O
you O
get O
a O
polite O
person O
, O
you O
often O
don O
t O
get O
a O
solution O
