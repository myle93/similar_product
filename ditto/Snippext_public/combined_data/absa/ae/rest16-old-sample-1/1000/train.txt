The O
fish B-AS
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-AS
price I-AS
sushi I-AS
deal I-AS
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Ess O
- O
A O
- O
Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty O
- O
town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-AS
in O
NY O
. O

I O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
and O
has O
great O
food B-AS
! O

Their O
pad B-AS
penang I-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
. O

Recommendations O
, O
of O
course O
, O
are O
required O
! O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

Also O
, O
do O
n't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll O
, O
if O
it O
's O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-AS
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

Same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

A O
gentleman B-AS
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-AS
bottles I-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-AS
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

quacamole B-AS
at O
pacifico O
is O

as O
are O
the O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

delicious O

The O

really O
fresh O
. O

I O
've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-AS
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

Too O
many O
other O
good O
places O

have O
to O
settle O
. O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

Go O
there O
once O
and O
oh O
yes O
... O
you O
will O
go O
back O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O

of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

$ O

... O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-AS
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-AS
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
local O
... O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B-AS
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

We O
had O
half B-AS
/ I-AS
half I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
mine O
was O
eggplant O
and O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O
and O
it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza O
! O

Ravioli B-AS
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
night O
person O
) O

The O
food B-AS
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-AS
like O
this O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place B-AS
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
OK O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
adn O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
! O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

The O
Dancing B-AS

as O
I O
can O
. O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O

Went O
for O

. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

For O
a O
Fabulous O

! O

If O
you O
are O

Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

Was O
n't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-AS
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

the O
pad B-AS
se I-AS
ew I-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
was O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-AS
in I-AS
spicy I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-AS
! O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

The O
mussles B-AS
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-AS
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
salad I-AS
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne B-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
chicken I-AS
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
some O
of O
the O
'best O
' O
sushi O
joints O
in O
NYC O
( O
Nobu O
, O
Bond O
Street O
, O
JewelBako O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
Yamato O
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O

and O

My O

slightly O

, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O

On O

out O

we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional O
. O

Just O
remember O

the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O

When O

he O
gave O
them O

their O

The O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B-AS
very O
much O
... O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O

I O
love O
Ess- O
a- O
bagel O
, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Drinks O
: O
2 O
glasses O
of O

The O
meat B-AS

are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS

a O

with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

lobster B-AS
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

The O

The O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O

sizes I-AS
are O
appropriate O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
Tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-AS
were O
friendly O
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O

The O

and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

It O
was O
pretty O

Great O

. O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-AS
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` B-AS
salt I-AS
encrusted I-AS
shrimp I-AS
'' I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

Their O
calzones B-AS
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
- O
inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

You O

says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

Pizza B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
) O
. O

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O

. O

There O

Immediately O
after O

the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O

pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

This O
place B-AS

a O
must O

! O

I O

recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

I O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
my O
ice O
water O
is O
kept O
full O
and O
my O
tea O
kettle O
filled O
with O
piping O
hot O
tea O
and O
that O
's O
all O
the O
service O
I O
need O
... O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao B-AS
's I-AS
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips- O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

Small O
servings B-AS
for I-AS
main I-AS
entree I-AS
, O
i O
had O
salmon B-AS
( O
wasnt O
impressed O
) O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B-AS
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
... O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
wonderfull O
. O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20's/ O
30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

It O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Chennai B-AS
Garden I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT B-AS
's I-AS
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

Best O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NY O
! O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
actors B-AS
. O

Go O
to O
son O
cubano O
in O
edgewater O
nj O
instead O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

it O
was O
really O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-AS
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-AS
salad I-AS
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-AS
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
must O
! O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

Not O
because O
you O
are O
`` O
The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
`` O
... O
– O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
charge O
an O

fresh B-AS
restaurant I-AS
was O
amazing O
... O
... O
.. O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

No O
, O
really O
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-AS
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
) O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

Wow O
. O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
though O
: O
) O

It O
's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria B-AS
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O

by O
a O

The O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O
! O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

great O
taste O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

Ahhh O
... O

Great O
pizza B-AS
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

Will O
comeback O
for O
sure O
, O
wish O
they O
have O
it O
here O
in O
LA.. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
) O
. O

Dessert B-AS
: O
pure O
disaster O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-AS
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Have O
the O
iced B-AS
tea I-AS
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O

had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B-AS
ever O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

Dessert B-AS
is O
a O
joke O
... O
dont O
bother O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

Love O
Al B-AS
Di I-AS
La I-AS

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit B-AS
- I-AS
out I-AS
, O
some O
attractive O
furnishings B-AS
and O
, O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
a O
reasonable O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
( O
I O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins O
) O

Loved O
it O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

Pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza B-AS
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings O
- O
the O
crust B-AS
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread O
! O

Their O
sake B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
! O

The O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
good O
size O
menu B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B-AS
. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-AS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

BEST O
DINING O
EXPERIENCE O
IN O
THE O
WEST O
VILLAGE O
! O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

Try O
green B-AS
curry I-AS
with I-AS
vegetables I-AS
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

I O
think O
I O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

The O
Cypriot B-AS
restaurant I-AS
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

enough O
said O
! O

Rao B-AS
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing O
special O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-AS
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
... O
. O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

Very O
pleased O

I O
've O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
and O
this O
spot O
delivers O
. O

Very O
immature O
bartender B-AS
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service B-AS
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses B-AS
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

Thank O
You O
Emilio B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-AS
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-AS
Salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-AS
and I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
... O
.both O
very O
tasty O
. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona B-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

for O
7 O
years O
they O
have O
put O
out O
the O
most O
tasty O
, O
most O
delicious O
food B-AS
and O
kept O
it O
that O
way O
... O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

I O
went O
there O
2times O
. O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy O
's O
! O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

I O
got O
the O
$ B-AS
10 I-AS
10 I-AS
- I-AS
piece I-AS
dim I-AS
sum I-AS
combo I-AS
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

We O
had O
fun O
eating O
in O
there O
, O
we O
were O
there O
like O
around O
3 O
a.m. O
in O
the O
morning O
! O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

Red B-AS
Dragon I-AS
Roll I-AS
- O
my O
favorite O
thing O
to O
eat O
, O
of O
any O
food O
group O
- O
hands O
down O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

( O
i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood.. O
) O

Zero O
ambiance B-AS
to O
boot O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
had O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

Great O
vibe B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

those O
rolls B-AS
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-AS
was O
n't O
fresh O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time O
. O

Service B-AS
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom B-AS
. O

The O
lava B-AS
cake I-AS
dessert I-AS
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
) O
. O

Great O
, O
original O
taste O
. O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

Raymond B-AS
the O
bartender O
rocks O
! O

I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-AS
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-AS
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-AS
sauce I-AS
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
duck B-AS
confit I-AS
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
terrine I-AS
with I-AS
figs I-AS
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-AS
England I-AS
Chowder I-AS
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

Good O
Experience O

I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
delicious O
dishes B-AS
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-AS
. O

Great O
sake B-AS
! O

The O
place B-AS
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Chinese I-AS
in O
the O
city O
, O
by O
far O
! O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B-AS
! O

Cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

This O
little O
place B-AS
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-AS
for O
your O
money O
. O

The O
soup B-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
udon I-AS
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

The O
sushi B-AS
was O
awful O
! O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B-AS
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-AS
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside- O
out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-AS
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

The O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
superb O
! O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

The O
mussels B-AS
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-AS
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-AS
with O
a O
smile O
. O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-AS
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

The O
flavors O
are O
amazing O
and O
the O
value O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

Once O
you O
try O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
beware.. O
you O
ca O
n't O
stop O
! O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B-AS
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O
- O
to O
for O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
`` O
can O
I O
help O
you O
'' O
and O
`` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
'' O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-AS
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

I O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
wonderful O
; O

great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
... O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

Regardless O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

The O

a O
great O
cocktail B-AS

Citrus I-AS
Vodka I-AS
and I-AS
lemon I-AS
and I-AS
lime I-AS
juice I-AS
and I-AS
mint I-AS
leaves I-AS
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B-AS
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
do O
n't O
know O

Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O

happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O
) O

whoever O
the O
jazz B-AS
duo I-AS
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

The O
brioche B-AS
and I-AS
lollies I-AS
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-AS
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

Always O
good O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

Service B-AS
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
NYC O
for O
bit O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-AS
more O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-AS
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

The O
quantity O
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

We O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
it O
's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

Tasty O
Dog B-AS
! O

Ingredients B-AS
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

Never O
again O
! O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
... O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

Whether O
it O
's O
the O
parmesean B-AS
porcini I-AS
souffle I-AS
or O
the O
lamb B-AS
glazed I-AS
with I-AS
balsamic I-AS
vinegar I-AS
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-AS
and O
great O
food B-AS
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

Check O
this O
place B-AS
out O
! O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
Tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-AS
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-AS
with O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-AS
place I-AS
! O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-AS
alla I-AS
marsala I-AS
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-AS
still O
open O
? O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
pre O
- O
sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-AS
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-AS
and O
a O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Wo O
n't O
or O
Ca O
n't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service O
directory O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

we O
love O
th O
pink B-AS
pony I-AS
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-AS
spot I-AS
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

The O
food B-AS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-AS
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B-AS
or I-AS
orange I-AS
flavoring I-AS
. O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

Excellent O
spot B-AS
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co O
- O
workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
have O
n't O
seen O
in O
a O
while O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
sat O
1/ O
26 O
and O
was O
disappointed O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-AS
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ai O
n't O
bad O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-AS
Kha I-AS
soup I-AS
was O
pathetic O
. O

you O
should O
travel O
from O
the O
Bronx O
to O
try O
it O
... O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

Come O
on O
. O

If O
you O
go O
, O
try O
the O
marinara B-AS
/ I-AS
arrabiatta I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
the O
mozzarella B-AS
en I-AS
Carozza I-AS
is O
mmmmmmmm O
... O
.. O
everything O
is O
just O
delicious O
. O

The O
shrimp B-AS
scampi I-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-AS
were O
plentiful O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

( O
Always O
ask O
the O
bartender O
for O
the O
SEASONAL B-AS
beer I-AS
! O
! O
! O

the O
all B-AS
- I-AS
u I-AS
- I-AS
can I-AS
- I-AS
eat I-AS
sushi I-AS
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-AS
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Great O
bagels B-AS
made O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
way O
. O

They O
have O
a O
delicious O
banana B-AS
chocolate I-AS
dessert I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
great O
green B-AS
tea I-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband O
. O

The O
DJ B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
keep O
going O
back O
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

I O
've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B-AS
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
and O
the O
rose B-AS
special I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
wo O
n't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines O
. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-AS
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
has O
great O
staff B-AS
. O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-AS
with O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-AS
la I-AS
Femme I-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatos I-AS
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-AS
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Unbelievable O
. O

this O
little O
place B-AS
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B-AS
in O
the O
City O

I O
CAN O
EAT O
HERE O
EVERY O
DAY O
OF O
THE O
WEEK O

were O
done O

and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O

Decent O
wine B-AS

reasonable O
prices O

Simply O
some O
good O

, O
hand O
- O
painted O
high O
ceiling B-AS
) O
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
were O
juicy O
and O
tender O
inside O
and O
had O
plenty O
of O
crunch O
and O
snap O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-AS
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-AS
and O
the O
name O
. O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-AS
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-AS
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-AS
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-AS
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
... O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice O
though O
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/ O
2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

Entrees O
: O
Vanison O
steak O
and O
Bison O
Steak O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
family B-AS
seafood I-AS
entree I-AS
was O
very O
good O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-AS
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-AS
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B-AS
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B-AS
( I-AS
Egg I-AS
) I-AS
rolls I-AS
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
with O
good O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
thin I-AS
crust I-AS
pizza I-AS
including O
the O
Basil B-AS
slice I-AS
. O

It O
's O
all O
about O
the O
food B-AS
! O
! O

Even O
though O
the O
place B-AS
is O
not O
beautiful O
, O
the O
food B-AS
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-AS
and O
bev B-AS
. O

great O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
.. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

I O
'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one O
- O
two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

cirspy O
crust O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-AS
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O
. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

Great O
staff B-AS
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B-AS
Ave I-AS
spot I-AS
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

And O
$ O
11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole B-AS
? O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-AS
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
... O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef B-AS
's I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
and O
your O
favourite O
bottle O
( O
or O
two O
! O
) O
of O
wine O
from O
an O
extensive O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-AS
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Good O
spreads B-AS
, O
great O
beverage B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
bagels B-AS
really O
tasty O
. O

however O
, O
it O
's O
the O
service B-AS
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

Lucky B-AS
Strike I-AS
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit O
- O
in O
. O

( O
The O
asparagus B-AS
, I-AS
truffle I-AS
oil I-AS
, I-AS
parmesan I-AS
bruschetta I-AS
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
! O

The O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
was O
special O
. O

But O
that O
was O
n't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-AS
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
ca O
n't O
hide O
. O

Love O
their O
drink B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-AS
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-AS
wooden I-AS
doors I-AS
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor B-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

Great O
sushi B-AS
experience O
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

the O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
scary O
! O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

bad O
staff B-AS

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars O

Maitre B-AS

`` O
Eat O

Each O
time O
we O
've O
been O

the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
( O
not O
the O
waiters B-AS
- O
they O
're O
fantastic O
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-AS
dishes I-AS
I O
would O
never O
return O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-AS
ribs I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

Moving O
on O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

Excellent O
food B-AS
, O
although O
the O
interior B-AS
could O
use O
some O
help O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
back O
. O

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

I O
'll O
being O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
positives O
: O
cool O
decor B-AS
, O
good O
pita B-AS
and O
hummus B-AS
, O
and O
grilled B-AS
octopus I-AS
that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty O
. O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-AS
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-AS
room I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-AS
is O
even O
better O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O

waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
the O
place B-AS
is O
pretty O
tiny O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-AS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
and I-AS
roe I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Raga B-AS
's I-AS
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
... O
.. O
this O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
... O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place B-AS

Just O
go O
to O
Yamato B-AS
and O
order O
the O
Red B-AS
Dragon I-AS
Roll I-AS
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

Service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting B-AS
/ I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
a O
lot O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
HUGE O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
) O
for O
two O
people O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared O
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
! O

The O
decor B-AS
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-AS
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place O
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi B-AS
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

The O
rice B-AS
to I-AS
fish I-AS
ration I-AS
was O
also O
good O
- O
- O
they O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
inedible O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant B-AS
is O
clean O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

Love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
we O
always O
go O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-AS
in O
Fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O.G O
. O
again O
last O
night O
. O

Old O
school O
meets O
New O
world O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
great O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

Way O
below O
average O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

Best O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Gorgeous O
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-AS
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
pre O
- O
theatre O
or O
after O
- O
theatre O
drinks O
! O

it O
's O
delicious O
! O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
; O
- O
) O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-AS
appetizers I-AS
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-AS
, O
you O
're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
Prime B-AS
Rib I-AS
it O
was O
good O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

The O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music O
to O
shout O
over O
- O
- O
how O
refreshing O
! O

The O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
) O
. O

Taxan B-AS
delicious O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B-AS
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O
- O
down O
. O

The O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

I O
've O
also O
been O
amazed O
at O
all O
the O
new O
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
: O
A O
new O
Jazz B-AS
Bar I-AS
, O
the O
most O
fantastic O
Dining B-AS
Garden I-AS
, O
the O
Best O
Thin B-AS
Crust I-AS
Pizzas I-AS
, O
and O
now O
a O
Lasagna B-AS
Menu I-AS
which O
is O
to O
die O
for O
( O
these O
are O
not O
your O
average O
lasagnas O
) O
! O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-AS
Go I-AS

no O
matter O
what O
the O

The O

Interesting O

Skip O

you O
can O
get O

at O
the O

go O
to O
Bark O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
were O
great O
. O

And O
even O
with O
it O
's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

The O
crust B-AS
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-AS
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly O
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

Best O
restaurant B-AS
in O
Brooklyn O

Traditional B-AS
French I-AS
decour I-AS
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-AS
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

Great O

Nice O
view B-AS

NYC I-AS

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
: O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comp O
it O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
views B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
city I-AS
were O
great O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

Would O
n't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner O
! O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O

. O

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
's O
cold O
! O

You O
'll O
be O

birthday O
, O
valentines O

... O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
calm O

Make O
sure O
you O

Great O

For O

1/ O
2 O
hour O

45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Sauce B-AS
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B-AS

I O
had O

Best O

Restaurant I-AS

The O
bibimbap B-AS
was O

the O

bowl I-AS
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O

Have O

the O
type O
of O

I O
enjoy O
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

We O
have O
gone O
for O
dinner B-AS
only O
a O
few O
times O
but O
the O
same O
great O
quality O
and O
service B-AS
is O
given O
. O

The O
baked B-AS
clams I-AS
octopus I-AS
we O
shared O
as O

were O
the O
best O
we O

reservations O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-AS
, O
chai B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chole B-AS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-AS
and O
dhal B-AS
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

Not O
enough O

Most O
of O
the O

are O
very O
attentive O

friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O

Great O
atmoshere B-AS

, O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
- O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

over O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

Great O
place B-AS
, O
great O
value O
. O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican O
! O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
booths B-AS
allow O
you O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
eachother O
without O
looking O
like O
'that O
' O
couple O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN O
; O
there O
are O
NO O
MEAT O
dishes B-AS
whatsoever O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-AS
shrimp I-AS
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-AS
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-AS
- I-AS
staff I-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-AS
! O

And O
I O
've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

if O
you O
're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-AS
vinegar I-AS
over I-AS
icecream I-AS
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
! O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

Bukhara B-AS
Grill I-AS
, O
the O
tagline O
says O
it O
all.. O
`` O
INDIAN O
SPICE O
RAVE O
'' O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-AS
I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-AS
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

amazing O
fresh O
dogs B-AS
but O
best O
of O
all O
endless O
toppings B-AS
! O
! O
! O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

Creative O
, O
consistent O
, O
fresh O
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

It O

also O
attached O
to O

which O
is O
a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O

We O
visited O

Week O
and O
tried O
their O

We O
were O
n't O
! O

never O
swaying O
, O
never O
a O
bad O
meal B-AS
, O
never O
bad O
service B-AS
... O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

Are O
you O
freaking O
kidding O
me O
? O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

An O
unpretentious O
spot B-AS
in O
Park O
Slope O
, O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
consistently O
good O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
pleasant O
, O
effective O
and O
unassuming O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-AS
booths I-AS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
( O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-AS
ceilings I-AS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
) O
. O

Can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-AS
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

Wish O
NY O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places O
: O
intimate O
, O
superb O
food B-AS
, O
homey O
, O
top O
notch O
all O
the O
way O
around O
, O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

Authentic O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
that O
's O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

It O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
the O
chef B-AS
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-AS
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

SO O
GOOD O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
is O
fairly O
priced O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-AS
! O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B-AS
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

It O
's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

Ambiance B-AS
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B-AS
of I-AS
herbs I-AS
and I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-AS
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B-AS
. O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

The O
lox B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Molto O
bene O
! O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-AS
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

Nice O
value O
. O

Do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place B-AS
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
beautiful O
place B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

The O
combination O
of O
super O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

I O
had O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
it O
has O
2 O
oz O
. O
of O
Maine O
Lobster O
in O
it O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot O
, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O
here O
, O
it O
was O
very O
well O
organized O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-AS
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O
! O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
) O
. O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

Downstairs B-AS
lounge I-AS
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor B-AS
, O
good O
service B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O
! O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

Not O
cheap O
but O
very O
yummy O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

Their O
bagels B-AS
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

This O
is O

BEST O

The O
pasta B-AS
penne I-AS
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
.but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O

because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

the O
crust B-AS
was O
imazingly O
cooked O
well O
and O
pizza B-AS
was O
fully O
loaded O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B-AS
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds- O
- O
this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/ O
10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

The O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B-AS
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
. O

The O
anti B-AS
- I-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B-AS
mains I-AS
. O

It O
’ O
s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘ O
excuse O
me O
’ O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-AS
! O

The O
food B-AS
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non B-AS
- I-AS
veg I-AS
selections I-AS
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-AS
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-AS
. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

Food B-AS
- O
awesome O
. O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-AS
black I-AS
sesame I-AS
mousse I-AS
( O
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
) O
and O
matcha B-AS
( I-AS
powdered I-AS
green I-AS
tea I-AS
) I-AS
and I-AS
blueberry I-AS
cheesecake I-AS
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

this O
place O
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings B-AS
and O
i O
mean O
all O
. O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-AS
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-AS
and O
great O
service B-AS
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

Went O

the O
place B-AS
was O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host O
, O
Vittorio B-AS
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
- O
- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not O
- O
so O
- O
frequent O

This O
small O
Astoria O

makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros B-AS
in O
New O

. O

Mazing O
interior B-AS

The O
portion B-AS
sizes O
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
good O
. O

I O
was O
visiting O
New O
York O
City O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
discovered O
this O
really O
warm O
and O
inviting O
restaurant B-AS
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B-AS
! O

some O
beef B-AS
and I-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

Rude O
service B-AS
, O
medicore O
food B-AS
... O
there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY O
... O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
one O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

Pizza B-AS
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade B-AS
pasta I-AS
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY- O
- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

Starters O
: O
Kobe O
Beef O
Sashimi O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

I O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-AS
tacos I-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

Expensive O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

This O
place B-AS
is O
worth O
an O
one O
- O
hour O
drive O
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-AS
Saul I-AS
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
's O
frequently O
. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd B-AS
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-AS

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-AS
croquette I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-AS
. O

The O
potato B-AS
balls I-AS
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
