The O
fish B-AS
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-AS
price I-AS
sushi I-AS
deal I-AS
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

Ess O
- O
A O
- O
Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty O
- O
town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-AS
in O
NY O
. O

I O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
and O
has O
great O
food B-AS
! O

Their O
pad B-AS
penang I-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
. O

Recommendations O
, O
of O
course O
, O
are O
required O
! O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

Also O
, O
do O
n't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll O
, O
if O
it O
's O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-AS
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

Same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

A O
gentleman B-AS
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-AS
bottles I-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-AS
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

quacamole B-AS
at O
pacifico O
is O

as O
are O
the O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

delicious O

The O

really O
fresh O
. O

I O
've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-AS
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

Too O
many O
other O
good O
places O

have O
to O
settle O
. O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

Go O
there O
once O
and O
oh O
yes O
... O
you O
will O
go O
back O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O

of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

$ O

... O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-AS
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-AS
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
local O
... O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B-AS
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

We O
had O
half B-AS
/ I-AS
half I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
mine O
was O
eggplant O
and O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O
and O
it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza O
! O

Ravioli B-AS
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
night O
person O
) O

The O
food B-AS
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-AS
like O
this O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place B-AS
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
OK O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
adn O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
! O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

The O
Dancing B-AS

as O
I O
can O
. O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O

Went O
for O

. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

For O
a O
Fabulous O

! O

If O
you O
are O

Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

Was O
n't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-AS
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

the O
pad B-AS
se I-AS
ew I-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
was O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-AS
in I-AS
spicy I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-AS
! O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

The O
mussles B-AS
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-AS
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
salad I-AS
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne B-AS
w I-AS
/ I-AS
chicken I-AS
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
some O
of O
the O
'best O
' O
sushi O
joints O
in O
NYC O
( O
Nobu O
, O
Bond O
Street O
, O
JewelBako O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
Yamato O
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O

and O

My O

slightly O

, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O

On O

out O

we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional O
. O

Just O
remember O

the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O

When O

he O
gave O
them O

their O

The O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B-AS
very O
much O
... O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

Run O

I O
love O
Ess- O
a- O
bagel O
, O

I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Drinks O
: O
2 O
glasses O

The O
meat B-AS

great O
, O
you O
get O

with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

lobster B-AS
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

The O

The O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O

sizes I-AS
are O
appropriate O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
Tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-AS
were O
friendly O
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O

The O

staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

It O
was O
pretty O

. O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-AS
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` B-AS
salt I-AS
encrusted I-AS
shrimp I-AS
'' I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

Their O
calzones B-AS
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
- O
inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

You O

says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

Pizza B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
) O
. O

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O

the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O

This O
place B-AS

Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

I O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Just O
make O
sure O
my O
ice O
water O
is O
kept O
full O
and O
my O
tea O
kettle O
filled O
with O
piping O
hot O
tea O
and O
that O
's O
all O
the O
service O
I O
need O
... O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao B-AS
's I-AS
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips- O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

Small O
servings B-AS
for I-AS
main I-AS
entree I-AS
, O
i O
had O
salmon B-AS
( O
wasnt O
impressed O
) O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken B-AS
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
... O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
wonderfull O
. O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20's/ O
30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

It O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Chennai B-AS
Garden I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT B-AS
's I-AS
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

Best O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NY O
! O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
actors B-AS
. O

Go O
to O
son O
cubano O
in O
edgewater O
nj O
instead O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

it O
was O
really O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-AS
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-AS
salad I-AS
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-AS
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
must O
! O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

Not O
because O
you O
are O
`` O
The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
`` O
... O
– O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
charge O

... O
.. O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

No O
, O
really O
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-AS
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
) O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

Wow O
. O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
though O
: O
) O

It O
's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria B-AS
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O

NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
food B-AS

! O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O
! O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

great O
taste O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

Ahhh O
... O

Great O
pizza B-AS
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

Will O
comeback O
for O
sure O
, O
wish O
they O
have O
it O
here O
in O
LA.. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
) O
