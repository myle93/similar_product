I O
have O
used O
PC O
's O
and O
converting O
to O
this O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
easy O
. O

It O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

Well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

I O
am O
constantly O
trying O
to O
uninstall O
programs B-AS
, O
clean O
cookies O
, O
and O
delete O
unused O
files O
. O

Probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

if O
this O
computer O
every O
breaks O
down O
on O
me O
i O
will O
most O
definatly O
get O
the O
same O
one O
again O
. O

Payed O
$ O
2200 O
for O
a O
`` O
premium O
'' O
laptop O

No O
big O
deal O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
a O
dream O
come O
true O
. O

It O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
to O
a O
bookstore O
, O
sit O
in O
the O
coffee O
shop O
area O
, O
sign O
in O
to O
WiFi O
and O
look O
up O
book O
reviews O
of O
books O
I O
might O
buy O
. O

The O
large O
screen B-AS
also O
helps O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
design B-AS
based I-AS
programs I-AS
like O
Adobe B-AS
Creative I-AS
Suite I-AS
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
. O

my O
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O
that O
does O
n't O
require O
a O
dedicated O
video B-AS
card I-AS
. O

We O
researched O
and O
found O
the O
best O
price B-AS
at O
MacConnection O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
extremely O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
to O
those O
heavy O
Windows O
Laptop O
. O

I O
loved O
the O
netbook O
( O
minus O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
windows B-AS
OS I-AS
) O
until O
this O
started O
happening O
. O

The O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance B-AS
- O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
I O
've O
seen O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

the O
apple O
pro O
notebook O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
i5 O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
have O
recycled O
ALL O
of O
my O
old O
PC O
laptops O
. O

A O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
MACBOOK O
PRO O
and O
it O
's O
better O
than O
ever O
. O

I O
have O
never O
really O
been O
big O
on O
downloading O
anything O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
too O
worried O
about O
getting O
a O
virus O
, O
plus O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
protected O
by O
Norton B-AS
. O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
am O
stuck O
. O

When O
I O
got O
my O
laptop O
back O
after O
this O
first O
instance O
it O
worked O
okay O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
then O
I O
started O
expeirencing O
issues O
again O
, O
everything O
from O
programs B-AS
and O
drivers B-AS
failing O
again O
, O
to O
it O
powering O
off O
for O
no O
reason O
, O
to O
locking O
up O
and O
freezing O
and O
just O
all O
sorts O
of O
issues O
. O

The O
touchpad B-AS
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons B-AS
to O
click O
again O
! O

the O
screen B-AS
brightness I-AS
automatically O
adjusts O
. O

I O
had O
3 O
months O
when O
the O
ports B-AS
started O
going O
out O
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
HP O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
recovery B-AS
disk I-AS
because O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
come O
with O
one O
and O
completely O
redo O
it O
all O
. O

The O
first O
one O
I O
had O
was O
a O
2006 O
model O
, O
not O
the O
Pro O
. O

All O
apple B-AS
associates I-AS
are O
always O
wiling O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

returned O
it O
. O

I O
have O
a O
business O
website O
and O
every O
time O
I O
have O
to O
change O
something O
I O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
public O
library O
to O
use O
a O
PC O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B-AS
. O

If O
you O
can O
afford O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
and O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
, O
of O
course O
, O
then O
definitely O
go O
for O
this O
. O

The O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software B-AS
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
good O
machine O
that O
does O
almost O
anything O
this O
is O
the O
one O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
low O
budget O
computer O
then O
look O
at O
the O
other O
great O
brands O
Best O
Buy O
sells O
. O

Second O
, O
it O
gets O
scratches O
easily O
and O
when O
it O
gets O
old O
some O
thing O
may O
operated O

Obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features B-AS
of O
any O
computer O
is O
the O
`` O
human B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

Then O
HP O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware B-AS
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

My O
wireless O
provider O
confirmed O
my O
home O
internet O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
any O
connections O
I O
turn O
on O
should O
work O
. O

The O
shop O
will O
definitely O
push O
the O
problem O
to O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
. O

Most O
of O
the O
large O
bags O
are O
for O
a O
17 O
inch O
. O

big O
mistake O
! O

The O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
. O

* O
4 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair* O
- O
Annoyed O
at O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
, O
decided O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
to O
Apple O
. O

Clear O
picture B-AS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

Simply O
amazing O
computer O
! O
! O

Everything O
I O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
I O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall B-AS
charger I-AS
cause O
the O
battery B-AS
is O
so O
awesome O
. O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
OSX B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features B-AS
that O
makes O
the O
use B-AS
more O
easy O
. O

I O
'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
everything O
else O
. O

I O
complain O
again O
... O

The O
gray B-AS
color I-AS
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B-AS
broad I-AS
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
, O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O

I O
know O
that O
ASUS O
is O
known O
for O
making O
motherboards B-AS
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
experience O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B-AS
! O

He O
loves O
it O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
well O
the O
schools O
start O
teaching O
the O
kids O
early O
about O
computers O
so O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
get O
started O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
side O
view O
angles O
are O
pretty O
good O
. O

It O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp B-AS
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

LOVE O
THIS O
LAPTOP O
WONDERFUL O
PRICE B-AS
FOR O
WHAT O
YOU O
GET O
! O

After O
paying O
over O
$ O
1000 O
for O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

also O
you O
may O
need O
to O
charge B-AS
it O
once O
a O
day O
, O
if O
for O
medium O
use O
every O
thing O
fast O
and O
easy O
with O
mac O
the O
size B-AS
and O
look B-AS
is O
the O
most O
feature B-AS
that O
attracted O
me O
to O
it O
. O

Peformance B-AS
is O
good O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O
Dell O
would O
last O
a O
week O
in O
environment O
of O
free O
competition O
with O
normal O
products O
- O
it O
only O
survives O
b/ O
c O
its O
substandard O
laptops O
are O
forced O
onto O
captive O
students O
and O
employees O
through O
question- O
raising O
programs O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
I O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O

My O
HP O
is O
very O
heavy O

Issues O
, O
at O
least O
for O
me O
. O

Two O
times O
with O
in O
one O
month O
. O

We O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
back O
up O
computer O
after O
our O
more O
expensive O
HP O
needed O
to O
be O
repaired O
. O

I O
baby O
my O
electronics O
so O
I O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
it O
was O
defective O
and O
not O
anything O
that O
I O
did O
to O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

First O
things O
first O
, O
Macbook O
pro O
has O
many O
applications B-AS
to O
make O
life O
easier O
, O
unlike O
the O
windows B-AS
computers O
. O

It O
's O
still O
beautiful O
and O
has O
better O
color B-AS
reproduction I-AS
than O
I O
could O
ever O
expect O
from O
a O
notebook O
. O

I O
always O
swore O
by O
PCs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
MAC O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
who O
is O
willing O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
money O
to O
get O
great O
quality B-AS
! O

I O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
HP O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

I O
bought O
mine O
from O
Apple O
Store O
the O
day O
it O
was O
released O
as O
Amazon O
did O
n't O
have O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
PC O
user O
since O
middle O
school O
, O
but O
in O
my O
mid O
twenties O
I O
decided O
to O
convert O
to O
the O
dark O
side O
, O
or O
should O
I O
say O
the O
brighter O
side O
of O
life O
. O

I O
'have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
and O
yes O
I O
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
. O

It O
's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program B-AS
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

Received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

I O
noticed O
windows B-AS
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
what O
about O
us O
Vista B-AS
users O
? O
They O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
Vista B-AS
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
. O

It O
was O
definelty O
a O
smart O
move O
. O

- O
I O
give O
up O
on O
my O
data O
, O
I O
just O
want O
a O
computer O
reasonably O
fast O
... O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
. O

I O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
Dell O
again O
. O

Just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing B-AS
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
laptop O
I O
purchased O
was O
also O
a O
Dell O
and O
again O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
i O
hated O
it O
. O

Temperatures B-AS
on O
the O
outside O
were O
alright O
but O
i O
did O
not O
track O
in O
Core B-AS
Processing I-AS
Unit I-AS
temperatures I-AS
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

Breaking O
within O
1 O
year O
of O
purchase O
and O
speaking O
to O
4+ O
people O
to O
report O
the O
damaged O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
late O
! O

I O
purchased O
an O
HP O
right O
after O
my O
high O
school O
graduation O
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
design B-AS
to O
the O
OS B-AS
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
. O

Ok O
first O
. O

That O
's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
. O

WOULD O
PAY O
MORE O
FOR O
IT O
IF O
I O
HAD O
TOO O
! O

They O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery B-AS
itself O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
die O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
on O
different O
batteries B-AS
with O
no O
luck O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
almost O
looked O
like O
a O
barcode O
when O
it O
froze O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
purposely O
`` O
destroy O
'' O
my O
netbook O
, O
so O
that O
I O
can O
demand O
a O
new O
set O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
public O
transport O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
and O
get O
a O
non O
- O
satisfactory O
solution O
? O
Or O
rather O
NO O
solution O
. O

Memory B-AS
is O
upgradable O
. O

It O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

BAck O
she O
goes O
! O

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser B-AS
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
awesome O
. O

To O
those O
thinking O
about O
switching O
, O
do O
it O
and O
do O
not O
look O
back O
! O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

I O
am O
also O
upset O
with O
CR O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
rating O
. O

you O
can O
find O
many O
laptops O
with O
the O
same O
performance B-AS
and O
even O
better O
with O
lower O
price B-AS
, O
but O
you O
can O
not O
find O
the O
look B-AS
, O
easy O
, O
applications B-AS
, O
and O
the O
experience O
in O
mac O
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
is O
better O
than O
the O
Toshiba O
, O
too O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

I O
did O
an O
internet O
search O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

When O
I O
am O
at O
Starbucks O
between O
clients O
I O
get O
full O
bars O
on O
my O
HP O
and O
1 O
bar O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
currently O
in O
West O
Verginia O
doe O
to O
the O
method O
of O
shipping B-AS
choosen O
by O
Toshiba O
. O

As O
a O
lifelong O
Windows B-AS
user O
, O
I O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
Mac O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
. O

They O
transfer O
you O
around O
to O
other O
people O
who O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
. O

This O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

Battery B-AS
life I-AS
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price B-AS
and O
Toshiba O
's O
reputation O
for O
laptops O
it O
's O
great O
! O

Quality B-AS
Display I-AS
I O
was O
surprised O
with O
the O
performance B-AS
and O
quality B-AS
of O
this O
HP O
Laptop O
. O

It O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

It O
has O
good O
speed B-AS
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
space I-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
to O
me O
is O
what O
really O
stands O
out O
though O
, O
you O
can O
do O
several O
different O
things O
with O
it O
just O
depending O
on O
how O
many O
fingers O
you O
use O
on O
the O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
, O
awesome O
thinking O
Apple O
! O

The O
acer O
one O
computer O
that O
I O
bought O
is O
17 B-AS
ince I-AS
screen I-AS
and O
its O
hard O
to O
find O
lap O
top O
bags O
for O
it O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
big O
screen B-AS
on O
it O
. O

- O
They O
say O
it O
will O
take O
`` O
up O
to O
two O
weeks O
'' O
. O

My O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
- O
- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
for O
three O
years O
now O
and O
still O
love O
it O
! O

They O
are O
wonderful O
, O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
. O

I O
am O
not O
happy O
at O
all O
with O
the O
product O
I O
purchased O
. O

Size B-AS
: O
I O
know O
13 O
is O
small O
( O
especially O
for O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
) O
but O
with O
an O
external B-AS
monitor I-AS
, O
who O
cares O
. O

It O
was O
about O
six O
months O
later O
when O
the O
overheating O
problem O
started O
again O
, O
to O
the O
point O
it O
felt O
like O
fire O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
machine O
! O

The O
keyboard B-AS
has O
a O
wonderful O
nature O
feel O
. O

Very O
dissappointed O
becase O
I O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

A O
MONTH O
LATER O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
OS B-AS
( I-AS
Vista I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Good O
luck O
with O
your O
purchase O
options O
. O

The O
computer O
continued O
to O
give O
me O
issues O
and O
in O
Late O
June O
it O
completely O
died O
again O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
call O
Acer O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
and O
they O
refused O
to O
help O
me O
, O
they O
said O
my O
warrenty B-AS
was O
up O
and O
hung O
up O
on O
me O
. O

The O
backlit B-AS
keys I-AS
are O
wonderful O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

I O
ordered O
four O
D620 O
laptops O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

That O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries B-AS
possible O
. O

Okay O
, O
let O
's O
just O
start O
out O
by O
saying O
I O
am O
in O
no O
way O
a O
computer O
techy O
. O

The O
speakers B-AS
are O
terrible O
and O
are O
probably O
the O
cheapest O
ones O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O
so O
if O
your O
planning O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
I O
suggest O
you O
get O
something O
better O
. O

three O
years O
is O
a O
decent O
life O
, O
but O
this O
must O
make O
it O
to O
graduation O
and O
beyond O
. O

on O
the O
bright O
side O
at O
least O
I O
was O
n't O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
long O
this O
time O
! O

It O
has O
everything O
I O
would O
need O
for O
a O
home O
computer O
. O

Maybe O
this O
is O
virus O
related O
, O
maybe O
not O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
has O
locked O
up O
many O
times O
, O
and O
on O
two O
occasions O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
has O
simply O
gone O
black O
. O

she O
ca O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
it O
and O
her O
regular O
desktop O
system O
. O

If O
you O
already O
own O
a O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
, O
or O
early O
2011 O
model O
, O
you O
should O
wait O
until O
the O
next O
update O
. O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

They O
're O
absolutely O
useless O
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
joy O
of O
releasing O
anger O
while O
smashing O
into O
little O
peices O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

This O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
before O
shutting O
down O
. O

And O
if O
you O
are O
a O
game O
player O
it O
works O
with O
World O
Of O
Warcraft O
wonderfully O
. O

I O
have O
had O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
these O
small O
netbooks O
a O
try O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-AS
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-AS
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

It O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam B-AS
, O
and O
Skype B-AS
works O
very O
well O
. O

So O
far O
, O
a O
great O
product O
. O

Now O
mainboard B-AS
is O
broken O
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

But O
I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
school B-AS
use I-AS
. O

Could O
not O
keep O
up O
with O
me O
and O
finally O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
went O
out O
. O

I O
already O
own O
an O
iPhone O
, O
and O
so O
the O
move O
just O
made O
more O
sense O
. O

Here O
we O
are O
another O
year O
later O
and O
the O
computer O
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

tons O
of O
bloatware O
and O
junk O
programs B-AS
. O

But O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
my O
part O
would O
be O
shipped O
nor O
could O
they O
tell O
me O
where O
to O
buy O
it O
ON O
THEIR O
WEBSITE O
! O
! O
! O

I O
had O
to O
adjust O
my O
mousepad B-AS
sensitivity I-AS
, O
because O
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O
. O

That O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse B-AS
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
. O

We O
did O
not O
even O
have O
it O
a O
year O
. O

I O
started O
hainv O
problems O
with O
it O
within O
the O
first O
month O
. O

The O
only O
time O
I O
have O
restarted O
is O
during O
system O
updates O
. O

It O
was O
also O
cheaper O
than O
the O
Pro O
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

I O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
. O

Its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
. O

A O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
: O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
IT O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
makes O
this O
computer O
almost O
unusable O
for O
online B-AS
service I-AS
. O

It O
seems O
they O
could O
have O
updated O
XP B-AS
and O
done O
without O
creating O
Vista B-AS
. O

The O
newer O
black B-AS
keyboard I-AS
took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
notebook O
! O

When O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
immediately O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
heavy O
and O
thick O
and O
not O
really O
attractive O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
it O
crash O
, O
randomly O
turn O
off O
, O

Garageband B-AS
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone B-AS
, O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O
and O
musicians O
at O
the O
intermediate O
level O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
a O
new O
Intel B-AS
Core I-AS
processors I-AS
and O
HDMI B-AS
port I-AS
so O
that O
we O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O
to O
our O
TV O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
and O
screen B-AS
are O
stunning O
and O
although O
I O
was O
a O
PC O
person O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
understand O
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

English O
must O
have O
been O
his O
third O
or O
fourth O
language O
. O

Fast O
, O
great O
visual B-AS
! O

I O
had O
less O
problems O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
suggest O
this O
laptop O
! O

So O
if O
you O
move O
laptop O
a O
lot O
, O
it O
might O
get O
loose O
, O
however O
it O
sits O
pretty O
tightly O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
also O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
touchpad B-AS
that O
caused O
the O
mouse B-AS
pointer I-AS
to O
jump O
all O
over O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

It O
's O
color B-AS
is O
even O
cool O
. O

However O
, O
a O
NETBOOK O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
. O

Toshiba O
does O
not O
send O
any O
one O
out O
unless O
you O
have O
paid O
extra O
to O
have O
the O
on O
site O
repair O
done O
. O

I O
was O
WRONG O
! O

also O
the O
keyboard B-AS
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
cant O
see O
anything O
and O
thats O
bad O
for O
me O
because O
my O
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me O
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

The O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
. O

But O
it O
may O
be O
potentially O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
I O
suggest O
going O
to O
apple.com O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B-AS
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
vivid O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
important O
for O
use O
quick O
typers O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
AND O
THEY O
LOST O
IT O
. O

But O
, O
buy O
this O
model O
and O
just O
purchase O
4GB B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
( O
2x2GB O
for O
$ O
92 O
or O
1x4GB O
for O
$ O
99 O
) O
, O
and O
save O
yourself O
$ O
100 O
than O
the O
other O
model O
with O
8GB B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
Dell O
I O
heard O
their O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

But O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

Fully O
charged B-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
can O
last O
about O
five O
hours O
unplugged O
. O

Did O
I O
mention O
everything O
about O
it O
, O
from O
size B-AS
to O
weight B-AS
to O
keyboard B-AS
screams O
BULK O
? O

Screen B-AS
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system B-AS
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

It O
is O
speedy O
when O
connected O
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O
regardless O
if O
the O
connection B-AS
is O
weak O
or O
not O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
build O
your O
own O
computer O
, O
but O
if O
u O
ca O
n't O
company O
's O
like O
dell O
who O
allow O
you O
to O
choose O
the O
components B-AS
are O
better O
and O
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
you O
can O
get O
a O
computer O
who O
compares O
to O
one O
of O
apple O
$ O
2000 O
systems O
and O
if O
you O
google O
`` O
dell O
coupons O
'' O
you O
can O
find O
codes O
that O
take O
a O
signifant O
amount O
off O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Not O
good O
for O
a O
person O
who O
gets O
online O
daily O
. O

First O
of O
all O

I O
've O
been O
Dell O

for O
more O

fifteen O
years O

THE O
MOTHERBOARD B-AS
IS O
DEAD O
! O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-AS
cd I-AS
's I-AS
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-AS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

I O
investigated O
netbooks O
and O
saw O
the O
Toshiba O

I O

2 O
) O
Blue O

Ive O
had O
to O
call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
many O
times O
. O

I O
think O
this O
will O
happen O
to O
any O
new O
version O
of O
computer/ O
phone O
released O
and O
I O
need O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
next O
set O
of O
updates O
to O
have O
all O
of O
this O
fixed O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O
! O

There O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features B-AS
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
MacBook O
! O

I O
think O
this O
ps O
was O
manufactured O
in O
the O
mid O
90 O
's O
. O

however O
, O
I O
may O
have O
inadvertently O
thrown O
out O
one O
of O
the O
batteries B-AS
with O
the O
shipping B-AS
carton I-AS
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
it O
I O
see O
that O
I O
really O
needed O
this O
for O
much O
more O
. O

but O
it O
came O
back O
in O
even O
worse O
shape O
. O

The O
DVD B-AS
drive I-AS
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
load O
on O
long O
trips O
where O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
is O
required O
. O

dell O
is O
a O
decently O
made O
pc O
. O

It O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
one O
of O
my O
purses O
! O

Web B-AS
access I-AS
through O
the O
3G B-AS
network I-AS
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it O
's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
VERY O
DISAPPOINTING O
. O

mac O
is O
extremely O
different O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
. O

In O
my O
house O
, O
HP O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
into O
Best O
Buy O
where O
I O
purchased O
it O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
over O
night O
to O
study O
it O
. O

Now O
I O
had O
not O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
since O
the O
disc B-AS
drive I-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
and O
after O
taking O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
I O
found O
out O
they O
had O
accidently O
not O
used O
the O
right O
drive B-AS
when O
they O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
, O
so O
back O
it O
went O
to O
get O
the O
correct O
drive B-AS
. O
