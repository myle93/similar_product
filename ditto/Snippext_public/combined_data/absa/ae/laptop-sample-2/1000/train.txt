I O
have O
used O
PC O
's O
and O
converting O
to O
this O
MacBook O
Pro O
was O
easy O
. O

It O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

Well O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

I O
am O
constantly O
trying O
to O
uninstall O
programs B-AS
, O
clean O
cookies O
, O
and O
delete O
unused O
files O
. O

Probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

if O
this O
computer O
every O
breaks O
down O
on O
me O
i O
will O
most O
definatly O
get O
the O
same O
one O
again O
. O

Payed O
$ O
2200 O
for O
a O
`` O
premium O
'' O
laptop O

No O
big O
deal O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
a O
dream O
come O
true O
. O

It O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
to O
a O
bookstore O
, O
sit O
in O
the O
coffee O
shop O
area O
, O
sign O
in O
to O
WiFi O
and O
look O
up O
book O
reviews O
of O
books O
I O
might O
buy O
. O

The O
large O
screen B-AS
also O
helps O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
design B-AS
based I-AS
programs I-AS
like O
Adobe B-AS
Creative I-AS
Suite I-AS
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
. O

my O
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O
that O
does O
n't O
require O
a O
dedicated O
video B-AS
card I-AS
. O

We O
researched O
and O
found O
the O
best O
price B-AS
at O
MacConnection O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
. O

The O
Macbook O
Pro O
is O
extremely O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
to O
those O
heavy O
Windows O
Laptop O
. O

I O
loved O
the O
netbook O
( O
minus O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
windows B-AS
OS I-AS
) O
until O
this O
started O
happening O
. O

The O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance B-AS
- O
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
I O
've O
seen O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
Mac B-AS
OS I-AS
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

the O
apple O
pro O
notebook O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
i5 O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
have O
recycled O
ALL O
of O
my O
old O
PC O
laptops O
. O

A O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
MACBOOK O
PRO O
and O
it O
's O
better O
than O
ever O
. O

I O
have O
never O
really O
been O
big O
on O
downloading O
anything O
so O
I O
was O
n't O
too O
worried O
about O
getting O
a O
virus O
, O
plus O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
protected O
by O
Norton B-AS
. O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
am O
stuck O
. O

When O
I O
got O
my O
laptop O
back O
after O
this O
first O
instance O
it O
worked O
okay O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
then O
I O
started O
expeirencing O
issues O
again O
, O
everything O
from O
programs B-AS
and O
drivers B-AS
failing O
again O
, O
to O
it O
powering O
off O
for O
no O
reason O
, O
to O
locking O
up O
and O
freezing O
and O
just O
all O
sorts O
of O
issues O
. O

The O
touchpad B-AS
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons B-AS
to O
click O
again O
! O

the O
screen B-AS
brightness I-AS
automatically O
adjusts O
. O

I O
had O
3 O
months O
when O
the O
ports B-AS
started O
going O
out O
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
HP O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
recovery B-AS
disk I-AS
because O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
come O
with O
one O
and O
completely O
redo O
it O
all O
. O

The O
first O
one O
I O
had O
was O
a O
2006 O
model O
, O
not O
the O
Pro O
. O

All O
apple B-AS
associates I-AS
are O
always O
wiling O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

returned O
it O
. O

I O
have O
a O
business O
website O
and O
every O
time O
I O
have O
to O
change O
something O
I O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
public O
library O
to O
use O
a O
PC O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B-AS
. O

If O
you O
can O
afford O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
and O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
, O
of O
course O
, O
then O
definitely O
go O
for O
this O
. O

The O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software B-AS
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
good O
machine O
that O
does O
almost O
anything O
this O
is O
the O
one O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
low O
budget O
computer O
then O
look O
at O
the O
other O
great O
brands O
Best O
Buy O
sells O
. O

Second O
, O
it O
gets O
scratches O
easily O
and O
when O
it O
gets O
old O
some O
thing O
may O
operated O

Obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features B-AS
of O
any O
computer O
is O
the O
`` O
human B-AS
interface I-AS
. O

Then O
HP O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware B-AS
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

My O
wireless O
provider O
confirmed O
my O
home O
internet O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
any O
connections O
I O
turn O
on O
should O
work O
. O

The O
shop O
will O
definitely O
push O
the O
problem O
to O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
. O

Most O
of O
the O
large O
bags O
are O
for O
a O
17 O
inch O
. O

big O
mistake O
! O

The O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
OS B-AS
X I-AS
. O

* O
4 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair* O
- O
Annoyed O
at O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
, O
decided O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
to O
Apple O
. O

Clear O
picture B-AS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

Simply O
amazing O
computer O
! O
! O

Everything O
I O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
I O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall B-AS
charger I-AS
cause O
the O
battery B-AS
is O
so O
awesome O
. O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
OSX B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features B-AS
that O
makes O
the O
use B-AS
more O
easy O
. O

I O
'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
everything O
else O
. O

I O
complain O
again O
... O

The O
gray B-AS
color I-AS
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B-AS
broad I-AS
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

I O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
, O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O

I O
know O
that O
ASUS O
is O
known O
for O
making O
motherboards B-AS
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
experience O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B-AS
! O

He O
loves O
it O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
well O
the O
schools O
start O
teaching O
the O
kids O
early O
about O
computers O
so O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
get O
started O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
nice O
, O
side O
view O
angles O
are O
pretty O
good O
. O

It O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp B-AS
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

LOVE O
THIS O
LAPTOP O
WONDERFUL O
PRICE B-AS
FOR O
WHAT O
YOU O
GET O
! O

After O
paying O
over O
$ O
1000 O
for O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

also O
you O
may O
need O
to O
charge B-AS
it O
once O
a O
day O
, O
if O
for O
medium O
use O
every O
thing O
fast O
and O
easy O
with O
mac O
the O
size B-AS
and O
look B-AS
is O
the O
most O
feature B-AS
that O
attracted O
me O
to O
it O
. O

Peformance B-AS
is O
good O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O
Dell O
would O
last O
a O
week O
in O
environment O
of O
free O
competition O
with O
normal O
products O
- O
it O
only O
survives O
b/ O
c O
its O
substandard O
laptops O
are O
forced O
onto O
captive O
students O
and O
employees O
through O
question- O
raising O
programs O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
and O
I O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O

My O
HP O
is O
very O
heavy O

Issues O
, O
at O
least O
for O
me O
. O

Two O
times O
with O
in O
one O
month O
. O

We O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
back O
up O
computer O
after O
our O
more O
expensive O
HP O
needed O
to O
be O
repaired O
. O

I O
baby O
my O
electronics O
so O
I O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
it O
was O
defective O
and O
not O
anything O
that O
I O
did O
to O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

First O
things O
first O
, O
Macbook O
pro O
has O
many O
applications B-AS
to O
make O
life O
easier O
, O
unlike O
the O
windows B-AS
computers O
. O

It O
's O
still O
beautiful O
and O
has O
better O
color B-AS
reproduction I-AS
than O
I O
could O
ever O
expect O
from O
a O
notebook O
. O

I O
always O
swore O
by O
PCs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
MAC O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
who O
is O
willing O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
money O
to O
get O
great O
quality B-AS
! O

I O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
HP O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

I O
bought O
mine O
from O
Apple O
Store O
the O
day O
it O
was O
released O
as O
Amazon O
did O
n't O
have O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
PC O
user O
since O
middle O
school O
, O
but O
in O
my O
mid O
twenties O
I O
decided O
to O
convert O
to O
the O
dark O
side O
, O
or O
should O
I O
say O
the O
brighter O
side O
of O
life O
. O

I O
'have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
and O
yes O
I O
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
. O

It O
's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program B-AS
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O
. O

So O
far O
so O
good O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

Received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

I O
noticed O
windows B-AS
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
, O
what O
about O
us O
Vista B-AS
users O
? O
They O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
Vista B-AS
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
. O

It O
was O
definelty O
a O
smart O
move O
. O

- O
I O
give O
up O
on O
my O
data O
, O
I O
just O
want O
a O
computer O
reasonably O
fast O
... O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
. O

I O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
Dell O
again O
. O

Just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing B-AS
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
laptop O
I O
purchased O
was O
also O
a O
Dell O
and O
again O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
i O
hated O
it O
. O

Temperatures B-AS
on O
the O
outside O
were O
alright O
but O
i O
did O
not O
track O
in O
Core B-AS
Processing I-AS
Unit I-AS
temperatures I-AS
. O

This O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

Breaking O
within O
1 O
year O
of O
purchase O
and O
speaking O
to O
4+ O
people O
to O
report O
the O
damaged O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
late O
! O

I O
purchased O
an O
HP O
right O
after O
my O
high O
school O
graduation O
. O

Everything O
from O
the O
design B-AS
to O
the O
OS B-AS
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
. O

Ok O
first O
. O

That O
's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
. O

WOULD O
PAY O
MORE O
FOR O
IT O
IF O
I O
HAD O
TOO O
! O

They O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery B-AS
itself O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
die O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
on O
different O
batteries B-AS
with O
no O
luck O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
almost O
looked O
like O
a O
barcode O
when O
it O
froze O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
purposely O
`` O
destroy O
'' O
my O
netbook O
, O
so O
that O
I O
can O
demand O
a O
new O
set O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
public O
transport O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
service B-AS
center I-AS
and O
get O
a O
non O
- O
satisfactory O
solution O
? O
Or O
rather O
NO O
solution O
. O

Memory B-AS
is O
upgradable O
. O

It O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

BAck O
she O
goes O
! O

Speaking O
of O
the O
browser B-AS
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
awesome O
. O

To O
those O
thinking O
about O
switching O
, O
do O
it O
and O
do O
not O
look O
back O
! O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
purchased O
it O
. O

I O
am O
also O
upset O
with O
CR O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
rating O
. O

you O
can O
find O
many O
laptops O
with O
the O
same O
performance B-AS
and O
even O
better O
with O
lower O
price B-AS
, O
but O
you O
can O
not O
find O
the O
look B-AS
, O
easy O
, O
applications B-AS
, O
and O
the O
experience O
in O
mac O
. O

The O
feel B-AS
of O
this O
is O
better O
than O
the O
Toshiba O
, O
too O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
I O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

I O
did O
an O
internet O
search O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

When O
I O
am O
at O
Starbucks O
between O
clients O
I O
get O
full O
bars O
on O
my O
HP O
and O
1 O
bar O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

The O
computer O
is O
currently O
in O
West O
Verginia O
doe O
to O
the O
method O
of O
shipping B-AS
choosen O
by O
Toshiba O
. O

As O
a O
lifelong O
Windows B-AS
user O
, O
I O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
Mac O
. O

I O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
. O

They O
transfer O
you O
around O
to O
other O
people O
who O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
. O

This O
worked O
just O
fine O
. O

Battery B-AS
life I-AS
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price B-AS
and O
Toshiba O
's O
reputation O
for O
laptops O
it O
's O
great O
! O

Quality B-AS
Display I-AS
I O
was O
surprised O
with O
the O
performance B-AS
and O
quality B-AS
of O
this O
HP O
Laptop O
. O

It O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

It O
has O
good O
speed B-AS
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
space I-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
to O
me O
is O
what O
really O
stands O
out O
though O
, O
you O
can O
do O
several O
different O
things O
with O
it O
just O
depending O
on O
how O
many O
fingers O
you O
use O
on O
the O
track B-AS
pad I-AS
, O
awesome O
thinking O
Apple O
! O

The O
acer O
one O
computer O
that O
I O
bought O
is O
17 B-AS
ince I-AS
screen I-AS
and O
its O
hard O
to O
find O
lap O
top O
bags O
for O
it O
, O
but O
I O
like O
the O
big O
screen B-AS
on O
it O
. O

- O
They O
say O
it O
will O
take O
`` O
up O
to O
two O
weeks O
'' O
. O

My O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
The O
statement O
of O
7 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
- O
- O
it O
's O
a O
lie O
. O

I O
've O
had O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
for O
three O
years O
now O
and O
still O
love O
it O
! O

They O
are O
wonderful O
, O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
. O

I O
am O
not O
happy O
at O
all O
with O
the O
product O
I O
purchased O
. O

Size B-AS
: O
I O
know O
13 O
is O
small O
( O
especially O
for O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
) O
but O
with O
an O
external B-AS
monitor I-AS
, O
who O
cares O
. O

It O
was O
about O
six O
months O
later O
when O
the O
overheating O
problem O
started O
again O
, O
to O
the O
point O
it O
felt O
like O
fire O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
machine O
! O

The O
keyboard B-AS
has O
a O
wonderful O
nature O
feel O
. O

Very O
dissappointed O
becase O
I O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

A O
MONTH O
LATER O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
OS B-AS
( I-AS
Vista I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Good O
luck O
with O
your O
purchase O
options O
. O

The O
computer O
continued O
to O
give O
me O
issues O
and O
in O
Late O
June O
it O
completely O
died O
again O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
call O
Acer O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
and O
they O
refused O
to O
help O
me O
, O
they O
said O
my O
warrenty B-AS
was O
up O
and O
hung O
up O
on O
me O
. O

The O
backlit B-AS
keys I-AS
are O
wonderful O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

I O
ordered O
four O
D620 O
laptops O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

That O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

The O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries B-AS
possible O
. O

Okay O
, O
let O
's O
just O
start O
out O
by O
saying O
I O
am O
in O
no O
way O
a O
computer O
techy O
. O

The O
speakers B-AS
are O
terrible O
and O
are O
probably O
the O
cheapest O
ones O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O
so O
if O
your O
planning O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
I O
suggest O
you O
get O
something O
better O
. O

three O
years O
is O
a O
decent O
life O
, O
but O
this O
must O
make O
it O
to O
graduation O
and O
beyond O
. O

on O
the O
bright O
side O
at O
least O
I O
was O
n't O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
long O
this O
time O
! O

It O
has O
everything O
I O
would O
need O
for O
a O
home O
computer O
. O

Maybe O
this O
is O
virus O
related O
, O
maybe O
not O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
has O
locked O
up O
many O
times O
, O
and O
on O
two O
occasions O
, O
the O
screen B-AS
has O
simply O
gone O
black O
. O

she O
ca O
n't O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
it O
and O
her O
regular O
desktop O
system O
. O

If O
you O
already O
own O
a O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
, O
or O
early O
2011 O
model O
, O
you O
should O
wait O
until O
the O
next O
update O
. O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
. O

My O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

They O
're O
absolutely O
useless O
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
joy O
of O
releasing O
anger O
while O
smashing O
into O
little O
peices O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

This O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
before O
shutting O
down O
. O

And O
if O
you O
are O
a O
game O
player O
it O
works O
with O
World O
Of O
Warcraft O
wonderfully O
. O

I O
have O
had O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
these O
small O
netbooks O
a O
try O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-AS
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-AS
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

It O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam B-AS
, O
and O
Skype B-AS
works O
very O
well O
. O

So O
far O
, O
a O
great O
product O
. O

Now O
mainboard B-AS
is O
broken O
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

But O
I O
needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
school B-AS
use I-AS
. O

Could O
not O
keep O
up O
with O
me O
and O
finally O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
went O
out O
. O

I O
already O
own O
an O
iPhone O
, O
and O
so O
the O
move O
just O
made O
more O
sense O
. O

Here O
we O
are O
another O
year O
later O
and O
the O
computer O
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

tons O
of O
bloatware O
and O
junk O
programs B-AS
. O

But O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
my O
part O
would O
be O
shipped O
nor O
could O
they O
tell O
me O
where O
to O
buy O
it O
ON O
THEIR O
WEBSITE O
! O
! O
! O

I O
had O
to O
adjust O
my O
mousepad B-AS
sensitivity I-AS
, O
because O
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O
. O

That O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse B-AS
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
. O

We O
did O
not O
even O
have O
it O
a O
year O
. O

I O
started O
hainv O
problems O
with O
it O
within O
the O
first O
month O
. O

The O
only O
time O
I O
have O
restarted O
is O
during O
system O
updates O
. O

It O
was O
also O
cheaper O
than O
the O
Pro O
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

I O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
. O

Its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
. O

A O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
: O
DO O
NOT O
BUY O
IT O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
makes O
this O
computer O
almost O
unusable O
for O
online B-AS
service I-AS
. O

It O
seems O
they O
could O
have O
updated O
XP B-AS
and O
done O
without O
creating O
Vista B-AS
. O

The O
newer O
black B-AS
keyboard I-AS
took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
notebook O
! O

When O
I O
got O
it O
, O
I O
immediately O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
heavy O
and O
thick O
and O
not O
really O
attractive O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
it O
crash O
, O
randomly O
turn O
off O
, O

Garageband B-AS
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone B-AS
, O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O
and O
musicians O
at O
the O
intermediate O
level O
. O

I O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
a O
new O
Intel B-AS
Core I-AS
processors I-AS
and O
HDMI B-AS
port I-AS
so O
that O
we O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O
to O
our O
TV O
. O

The O
graphics B-AS
and O
screen B-AS
are O
stunning O
and O
although O
I O
was O
a O
PC O
person O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
understand O
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

English O
must O
have O
been O
his O
third O
or O
fourth O
language O
. O

Fast O
, O
great O
visual B-AS
! O

I O
had O
less O
problems O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
suggest O
this O
laptop O
! O

So O
if O
you O
move O
laptop O
a O
lot O
, O
it O
might O
get O
loose O
, O
however O
it O
sits O
pretty O
tightly O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
also O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
touchpad B-AS
that O
caused O
the O
mouse B-AS
pointer I-AS
to O
jump O
all O
over O
the O
screen B-AS
. O

It O
's O
color B-AS
is O
even O
cool O
. O

However O
, O
a O
NETBOOK O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
. O

Toshiba O
does O
not O
send O
any O
one O
out O
unless O
you O
have O
paid O
extra O
to O
have O
the O
on O
site O
repair O
done O
. O

I O
was O
WRONG O
! O

also O
the O
keyboard B-AS
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
cant O
see O
anything O
and O
thats O
bad O
for O
me O
because O
my O
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me O
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

The O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
. O

But O
it O
may O
be O
potentially O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

If O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
I O
suggest O
going O
to O
apple.com O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B-AS
. O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run B-AS
flawlessly O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
vivid O
and O
the O
keyboard B-AS
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
important O
for O
use O
quick O
typers O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
back O
AND O
THEY O
LOST O
IT O
. O

But O
, O
buy O
this O
model O
and O
just O
purchase O
4GB B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
( O
2x2GB O
for O
$ O
92 O
or O
1x4GB O
for O
$ O
99 O
) O
, O
and O
save O
yourself O
$ O
100 O
than O
the O
other O
model O
with O
8GB B-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
Dell O
I O
heard O
their O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

But O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

Fully O
charged B-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
can O
last O
about O
five O
hours O
unplugged O
. O

Did O
I O
mention O
everything O
about O
it O
, O
from O
size B-AS
to O
weight B-AS
to O
keyboard B-AS
screams O
BULK O
? O

Screen B-AS
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system B-AS
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

This O
MacBook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B-AS
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

It O
is O
speedy O
when O
connected O
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O
regardless O
if O
the O
connection B-AS
is O
weak O
or O
not O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
build O
your O
own O
computer O
, O
but O
if O
u O
ca O
n't O
company O
's O
like O
dell O
who O
allow O
you O
to O
choose O
the O
components B-AS
are O
better O
and O
for O
the O
same O
price B-AS
you O
can O
get O
a O
computer O
who O
compares O
to O
one O
of O
apple O
$ O
2000 O
systems O
and O
if O
you O
google O
`` O
dell O
coupons O
'' O
you O
can O
find O
codes O
that O
take O
a O
signifant O
amount O
off O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Not O
good O
for O
a O
person O
who O
gets O
online O
daily O
. O

First O
of O
all O

I O
've O
been O
Dell O

for O
more O

fifteen O
years O

THE O
MOTHERBOARD B-AS
IS O
DEAD O
! O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-AS
cd I-AS
's I-AS
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-AS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

I O
investigated O
netbooks O
and O
saw O
the O
Toshiba O

I O

2 O
) O
Blue O

Ive O
had O
to O
call O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
many O
times O
. O

I O
think O
this O
will O
happen O
to O
any O
new O
version O
of O
computer/ O
phone O
released O
and O
I O
need O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
next O
set O
of O
updates O
to O
have O
all O
of O
this O
fixed O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O
! O

There O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features B-AS
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
MacBook O
! O

I O
think O
this O
ps O
was O
manufactured O
in O
the O
mid O
90 O
's O
. O

however O
, O
I O
may O
have O
inadvertently O
thrown O
out O
one O
of O
the O
batteries B-AS
with O
the O
shipping B-AS
carton I-AS
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
it O
I O
see O
that O
I O
really O
needed O
this O
for O
much O
more O
. O

but O
it O
came O
back O
in O
even O
worse O
shape O
. O

The O
DVD B-AS
drive I-AS
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
load O
on O
long O
trips O
where O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
is O
required O
. O

dell O
is O
a O
decently O
made O
pc O
. O

It O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
one O
of O
my O
purses O
! O

Web B-AS
access I-AS
through O
the O
3G B-AS
network I-AS
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it O
's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
VERY O
DISAPPOINTING O
. O

mac O
is O
extremely O
different O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
. O

In O
my O
house O
, O
HP O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

I O
took O
the O
computer O
into O
Best O
Buy O
where O
I O
purchased O
it O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
over O
night O
to O
study O
it O
. O

Now O
I O
had O
not O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
since O
the O
disc B-AS
drive I-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
and O
after O
taking O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Geek O
Squad O
I O
found O
out O
they O
had O
accidently O
not O
used O
the O
right O
drive B-AS
when O
they O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
, O
so O
back O
it O
went O
to O
get O
the O
correct O
drive B-AS
. O

I O
got O
assurances O
from O
2 O
different O
people O
that O
the O
remaining O
10 O
months O
of O
my O
warranty B-AS
would O
transfer O
to O
the O
new O
computer O
. O

There O
's O
literally O
no O
way O
to O
make O
it O
sing O
with O
Vista B-AS
. O

She O
said O
its O
very O
user O
friendly O
. O

Numerous O
problems O
over O
the O
next O
3 O
weeks O
until O
I O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
and O
had O
to O
send O
the O
PC O
back O
to O
HP O
. O

I O
think O
I O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
have O
the O
A65 O
- O
right O
now O
it O
's O
a O
paperweight O
. O

I O
paid O
$ O
800 O
for O
this O
computer O
from O
my O
school O
campus O
bookstore O
. O

The O
sheer O
power B-AS
and O
flexibility B-AS
makes O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
a O
must O
have O
for O
any O
techie O
! O

The O
laptop O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
set B-AS
up I-AS
. O

The O
17 B-AS
inch I-AS
screen I-AS
is O
very O
large O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
light O
. O

It O
is O
everything O
I O
'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look B-AS
and I-AS
feel I-AS
standpoint I-AS
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O
. O

The O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-AS
up I-AS
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

- O
they O
lost O
my O
laptop O
for O
a O
month O

You O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
such O
a O
great O
thing O
like O
this O
! O

It O
was O
a O
laugh O
too O
! O

Very O
good O
quality B-AS
and O
well O
made O
. O

Reason O
why O
? O
It O
's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value B-AS
for O
that O
laptop O
, O
the O
price B-AS
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
, O
and O
even O
if O
Apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
, O
your O
laptop O
value B-AS
will O
only O
drop O
10 O
- O
20 O
% O
, O
unlike O
PC O
laptops O
which O
drop O
more O
than O
80 O
% O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
3 O
weeks O
to O
get O
it O
back O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
working O
properly O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
many O
PC O
laptops O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

Its O
fast O
, O
has O
High B-AS
definition I-AS
quality I-AS
in O
the O
videos O
. O

its O
sad O
because O
their O
commercials O
are O
great O
. O

very O
convenient O
when O
you O
travel O
and O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
... O

I O
picked O
it O
out O
because O
it O
was O
inexpensive O
( O
$ O
400 O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
, O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
first O
laptop O
. O

The O
little O
battery B-AS
that O
it O
did O
have O
would O
only O
last O
about O
an O
hour O
while O
just O
having O
it O
on O
the O
desktop O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
for O
a O
better O
device O
. O

I O
had O
always O
used O
PCs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating B-AS
systems I-AS
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
. O

Good O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

bought O
the O
first O
asus O
laptop O
in O
san O
francisco O
, O
returned O
it O
in O
santa O
maria O
, O
thinking O
it O
was O
just O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
computer O
. O

I O
run O
Dreamweaver B-AS
, O
Final B-AS
Cut I-AS
Pro I-AS
7 I-AS
, O
Photoshop B-AS
, O
Safari B-AS
, O
Firefox B-AS
, O
MSN B-AS
Messenger I-AS
and O
a O
few O
other O
applications B-AS
constantly O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

even O
though O
I O
had O
the O
receipt O
in O
front O
of O
me O
proving O
it O
still O
had O
2 O
months O
left O
on O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

Within O
3 O
weeks O
the O
same O
issues O
started O
happening O
AGAIN O
. O

this O
company O
truely O
does O
make O
horrible O
products O
and O
doesnt O
seem O
to O
because O
they O
are O
certain O
things O
like O
this O
`` O
never O
'' O
happen O
... O

My O
wife O
recently O
purchased O
an O
Apple O
MacBook O
Pro O
and O
our O
granddaughter O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
and O
asked O
for O
one O
for O
her O
birthday O
. O

Sadly O
Apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
MacBook O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
Pros O
. O

I O
take O
it O
everywhere O
with O
me O
because O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry B-AS
. O

My O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre B-AS
- I-AS
loaded I-AS
Norton I-AS
Firewall I-AS
/ I-AS
Security I-AS
program I-AS
. O

The O
speed B-AS
is O
incredible O
and O
I O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
a O
month O
or O
two O
ago O
. O

They O
were O
able O
to O
set- O
up O
with O
labtops O
themselves O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

I O
will O
not O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
: O
I O
love O
newegg O
, O
I O
recommend O
them O
to O
the O
world O
however O
this O
is O
just O
unacceptable O
. O

I O
also O
did O
not O
like O
the O
loud O
noises B-AS
it O
made O
or O
how O
the O
bottom B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
computer I-AS
would O
get O
really O
hot O
. O

It O
is O
not O
even O
a O
year O
old O
yet O
, O
so O
I O
would O
definitely O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

It O
took O
several O
weeks O
just O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
I O
owned O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

The O
driver B-AS
updates I-AS
do O
n't O
fix O
the O
issue O
, O
very O
frustrating O
. O

I O
love O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
use O
it O
everyday O
to O
do O
something O
, O
and O
never O
lets O
me O
down O
. O

I O
remind O
myself O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
take O
off O
my O
watch O
when O
ever O
I O
look O
at O
the O
small O
scratch O
that O
it O
has O
caused O
. O

I O
simply O
got O
tired O
of O
a O
bad O
computer O
like O
windows O
with O
its O
constant O
freezing O
and O
anti- O
virus O
. O

It O
has O
no O
camera B-AS
but O
, O
I O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

The O
bottom- O
line O
is O
that O
this O
laptop O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
. O

So O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
, O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
! O

I O
worked O
in O
IT O
retail O
sales O
before O
. O

the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
will O
make O
it O
easy O
for O
you O
to O
write O
and O
read O
your O
emails O
at O
blazing O
speeds B-AS
. O

When O
I O
called O
Sony O
the O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
was O
Great O
. O

This O
laptop O
serves O
all O
my O
needs O
. O

I O
am O
overall O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
toshiba O
satellite O
, O
I O
like O
the O
extra B-AS
features I-AS
, O
I O
love O
the O
windows B-AS
7 I-AS
home I-AS
premium I-AS
. O

They O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty B-AS
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
Toshiba O
. O

My O
MacBook O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
investment O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

The O
magnetic B-AS
plug I-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
power I-AS
charging I-AS
power I-AS
cord I-AS
is O
great O
( O
I O
even O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O
) O
- O
excellent O
innovation O
! O

Before O
we O
got O
this O
laptop O
, O
had O
a O
compaq O
pasaro O
for O
5 O
years O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

PC O
users O
use O
the O
Powerpoint B-AS
program I-AS
for O
slide O
- O
show O
presentation O
and O
Mac O
users O
utilize O
Keynote B-AS
. O

Screen B-AS
is O
crystal O
clear O
, O
yes O
it O
's O
small O
- O
but O
it O
's O
a O
netbook O
! O

They O
told O
me O
it O
was O
my O
loss O
even O
though O
it O
was O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
what O
I O
've O
done O
. O

I O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
AGAIN O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
mother B-AS
board I-AS
yet O
again O
. O

I O
have O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

It O
has O
happened O
again O
and O
I O
'm O
being O
told O
that O
it O
's O
$ O
175 O
. O

It O
's O
even O
easy O
to O
hook B-AS
up I-AS
to I-AS
other I-AS
wireless I-AS
networks I-AS
. O

I O
've O
owned O
this O
labtop O
for O
less O
then O
two O
months O
, O
already O
the O
mouse B-AS
button I-AS
has O
broke O
. O

Better O
stick O
with O
another O
brand O
. O

Great O
overall O
. O

After O
having O
two O
PC O
laptops O
die O
with O
in O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
, O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
Apple O
display O
at O
Best O
Buy O
by O
the O
sleek O
design B-AS
and O
promise O
of O
less O
tech B-AS
issues I-AS
. O

It O
is O
made O
better O
, O
thicker O
, O
and O
all O
out O
tough O
! O

Enough O
said O
. O

It O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
work O
and O
pleasure O
while O
traveling O
. O

So O
you O
out O
of O
of O
notebook O
and O
money O
. O

I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
! O

I O
love O
it O
! O

They O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
susceptible O
to O
viruses O
, O
which O
is O
one O
less O
big O
thing O
to O
worry O
about O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
computers O
. O

Am O
very O
glad O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price B-AS
. O

As O
a O
user O
of O
a O
PC O
, O
I O
will O
will O
admit O
that O
the O
macBook O
Pro O
has O
a O
better O
running B-AS
system I-AS
in O
which O
I O
found O
myself O
`` O
Getting O
the O
job O
done O
quicker O
. O

So O
, O
buyers O
beware O
! O

After O
that O
I O
turned O
to O
email O
in O
my O
next O
vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
warranty B-AS
was O
still O
valid O
. O

I O
can O
throw O
anything O
at O
it O
( O
and O
I O
do O
) O
, O
Pictures O
, O
video O
editing O
, O
schoolwork O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
huge O
and O
coloful O
, O
but O
no O
LED O
backlighting O
. O

With O
all O
the O
programs B-AS
that O
came O
with O
it O
, O
such O
as O
iLife B-AS
and O
iWork B-AS
, O
I O
was O
set O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

So O
, O
after O
Apple O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
I O
enjoyed O
another O
4 O
months O
of O
my O
new O
computer O
, O
until O
it O
froze O
this O
morning O
- O
- O
completely O
. O

This O
was O
the O
3rd O
day O
and O
part O
still O
had O
not O
been O
shipped B-AS
. O

My O
sister O
is O
the O
electronics O
manager O
at O
Wal O
Mart O
and O
she O
says O
that O
HP O
is O
the O
best O
. O

I O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
100 O
for O
a O
universal B-AS
charger I-AS
for O
this O
cheap O
$ O
300 O
laptop O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
might O
add O
is O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

I O
would O
tell O
the O
technician B-AS
I O
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
but O
they O
did O
not O
listen O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
through O
a O
bunch O
of O
junk O
to O
get O
them O
to O
tell O
me O
I O
needed O
to O
send O
the O
computer O
in O
. O

( O
I O
definatly O
ca O
n't O
) O
. O

It O
gives O
me O
the O
power B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
that O
I O
need O
to O
run O
all O
the O
programs B-AS
I O
use O
to O
edit O
. O

It O
was O
over O
rated O
! O

We O
purchase O
the O
Dell O
XPS O
several O
years O
ago O
for O
my O
home O
business O
. O

After O
the O
first O
few O
months O
, O
the O
computer O
started O
crashing O
about O
every O
week O
. O

The O
apple O
systems O
are O
over O
priced O
luxurys O
that O
ar O
n't O
worth O
what O
they O
are O
being O
charged O
for O
, O
this O
model O
's O
specifications B-AS
are O
far O
from O
being O
impressive O
and O
they O
only O
thing O
you O
get O
out O
of O
this O
is O
the O
apple O
name O
. O

I O
called O
Toshiba O
and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
while O
they O
look O
at O
the O
problem O
. O

ca O
n't O
reinstall O
with O
standard B-AS
os I-AS
cd I-AS
because O
of O
proprietary B-AS
hardware I-AS
drivers I-AS
. O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O
finger O
and O
the O
pointer B-AS
will O
not O
even O
move O
. O

Sony O
parts O
reliability O
and O
quality O
of O
service B-AS
is O
recenlty O
the O
worst O
. O

After O
the O
warrenty B-AS
expired O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
went O
bad O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
to O
fix O
then O
to O
replace O
. O

That O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
! O

i O
had O
the O
bulk O
of O
problems O
with O
my O
lap O
top O
within O
the O
first O
six O
months O
. O

The O
Macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-AS
packing I-AS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B-AS
works O
great O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
gets O
so O
HOT O
it O
is O
scary O
. O

its O
not O
bad O
just O
VERY O
VERY O
annoying O
. O

YOU O
PAY O
FOR O
WHAT O
YOU O
GET O
FOR O
. O

THIS O
HAS O
BEEN O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
HEADACHE O
SINCE O
WE O
PURCHASED O
IT O
. O

My O
laptop O
is O
almost O
2yrs O
old O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
comply O
with O
these O
too O
and O
now O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
if O
they O
can O
find O
another O
way O
to O
screw O
me O
. O

cosmetically O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
changed O
was O
2 O
of O
the O
Function B-AS
keys I-AS
at O
the O
top O
. O

Be O
safe O
buy O
a O
Sony O
. O

Granted O
, O
it O
's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
my O
Mac O
boots B-AS
up I-AS
noticeably O
quicker O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

It O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
DIES O
( O
like O
a O
PC O
, O
maybe O
worse O
) O
and O
I O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

It O
is O
as O
good O
as O
new O
. O

I O
was O
sorly O
disapointed O
to O
discover O
that O
HP O
( O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
reputable O
company O
) O
would O
n't O
honor O
the O
warrenty B-AS
when O
the O
fan B-AS
blade I-AS
fell O
apart O
. O

It O
bluescreened O
on O
me O
without O
any O
warning O
, O
running O
simply O
basic O
Chrome B-AS
. O

without O
having O
to O
have O
extra O
equipment O
and/ O
or O
complicated O
routes O
to O
take O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
did O
not O
have O
all O
the O
features B-AS
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
promised O
about O
10 O
hours O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
to O
a O
limited O
7 O
hours O
( O
which O
is O
still O
amazing O
) O
. O

The O
unibody B-AS
design I-AS
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O
. O

A O
great O
feature B-AS
is O
the O
spotlight B-AS
search I-AS
: O
one O
can O
search O
for O
documents O
by O
simply O
typing O
a O
keyword O
, O
rather O
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O
. O

Though O
you O
get O
a O
polite O
person O
, O
you O
often O
don O
t O
get O
a O
solution O
. O

i O
love O
the O
size B-AS
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O
games B-AS
on O
it O
. O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
specs O
on O
Apple O
products O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
Dell O
or O
a O
HP O
, O
yes O
they O
do O
seem O
to O
offer O
less O
for O
a O
higher O
cost B-AS
. O

It O
is O
so O
great O
, O
I O
can O
Hardly O
ever O
take O
my O
hands O
off O
it O
! O

Has O
a O
5 O
- O
6 O
hour O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
should O
have O
realized O
that O
trouble O
was O
brewing O
. O

I O
was O
waiting O
for O
this O
model O
to O
be O
released O
since O
January O
, O
and O
have O
been O
holding O
off O
on O
buying O
a O
Macbook O
Pro O
until O
the O
new O
model O
came O
out O
. O

For O
me O
I O
was O
lucky O
and O
a O
local O
store O
was O
selling O
them O
for O
$ O
2000 O
off O
and O
Best O
Buy O
matched O
their O
price B-AS
so O
I O
was O
able O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
under O
$ O
1000 O

apple O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
computer O
companies O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
good O
sized O
and O
wasy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

It O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
everything O
I O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
more O
. O

Then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O
but O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty B-AS
. O

I O
had O
to O
call O
Apple O
19 O
times O
( O
each O
time O
40 O
to O
75 O
minutes O
on O
the O
phone O
) O
, O
and O
take O
it O
to O
their O
store O
for O
evaluations O
, O
and O
diagnostics O
, O
5 O
times O
. O

The O
only O
problems O
are O
the O
sound B-AS
isnt O
very O
loud O
I O
have O
to O
wear O
headphones O
. O

I O
paid O
about O
18000 O
for O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
all O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O
and O
it O
kept O
crapping O
out O
on O
me O
. O

It O
could O
be O
a O
perfect O
laptop O
if O
it O
would O
have O
faster O
system B-AS
memory I-AS
and O
its O
radeon B-AS
5850 I-AS
would O
have O
DDR5 B-AS
instead O
of O
DDR3 B-AS
. O

super O
fast O
processor B-AS
and O
really O
nice O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
.. O

My O
kids O
have O
to O
take O
their O
PCs O
in O
once O
a O
year O
to O
have O
them O
`` O
de- O
bugged O
'' O
. O

The O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

But O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
your O
product O
last O
more O
than O
a O
year O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
my O
business O
again O
. O

The O
4 O
USB B-AS
ports I-AS
are O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
two O
on O
the O
side O
only O
work O
now O
and O
then O
. O

THis O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
. O

It O
was O
an O
all O
around O
waste O
of O
money O
for O
me O
. O

Also O
consider O
the O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
apps I-AS
are O
all O
trial O
versions O
, O
hope O
you O
have O
your O
own O
copies O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
during O
the O
recent O
Comex O
IT O
show O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume B-AS
buttons I-AS
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
. O

Then O
it O
ceased O
charging B-AS
at O
all O
. O

My O
Mac O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
trusted O
friend O
to O
an O
adversary O
. O

I O
tried O
giving O
it O
0 O
stars O
but O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
at O
least O
one O
, O
but O
IMO O
NO O
STARS O

Startup B-AS
in O
about O
30 O
seconds O
, O
shutdown B-AS
in O
2 O
- O
4 O
seconds O
, O
resume B-AS
from I-AS
sleep I-AS
in O
0 O
- O
2 O
seconds O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
computer O
was O
light O
weight O
, O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
, O
and O
was O
pretty O
self O
explantory O
in O
use B-AS
. O

and O
if O
u O
did O
. O

The O
overall O
build B-AS
quality I-AS
of O
the O
unit O
is O
excellent O
and O
she O
'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
else O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
. O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
seventy O
nine O
plus O
tax O
. O

I O
am O
a O
full O
Mac O
convert O
now O
. O

The O
service B-AS
I O
received O
from O
Toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O
. O

The O
Mac B-AS
version I-AS
of I-AS
Microsoft I-AS
Office I-AS
is O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
the O
actual O
and O
works O
just O
as O
well O
. O

I O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
HP O
and O
could O
NOT O
understand O
the O
techie B-AS
due O
to O
his O
accent O
. O

I O
will O
be O
patient O
for O
few O
months O
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
, O
it O
( O
laptop O
) O
runs B-AS
great O
and O
loads B-AS
fast O
. O

while O
about O
8 O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
has O
changed O
. O

I O
Hate O
it O
! O

Only O
thing O
I O
would O
want O
to O
add O
to O
this O
is O
an O
internal O
bluray B-AS
read I-AS
/ I-AS
write I-AS
drive I-AS
. O

It O
is O
truly O
a O
Desktop O
Replacement O
. O

Money O
and O
time O
well O
spent O
! O

As O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
, O
, O
about O
4 O
inches O
across O
is O
hardly O
visible O
. O

Ease O
of O
use B-AS
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
I O
love O
about O
my O
Mac O
. O

The O
lcd B-AS
screen I-AS
stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
10 O
months O
. O

I O
am O
now O
making O
a O
point O
to O
avoid O
their O
products O
and O
I O
hope O
my O
experience O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
you O
as O
well O
. O

WIth O
the O
upgraded B-AS
memory I-AS
, O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
never O
has O
an O
issue O
running B-AS
many O
many O
applications B-AS
at O
once O
! O

So O
I O
called O
, O
AGAIN O
. O

Dell O
Latitude O
d620 O
is O
not O
a O
reliable O
machine O
. O

They O
sent O
it O
off O
and O
within O
2 O
weeks O
I O
had O
it O
back O
good O
as O
new O
. O

I O
believe O
I O
purchased O
this O
in O
Dec O
09 O
for O
my O
primary O
work O
laptop O
which O
is O
used O
5- O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
4- O
6 O
days O
a O
week O
. O

It O
still O
heats O
up O
like O
mad O
and O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
use O
it O
with O
the O
computer O
directly O
on O
my O
lap O
for O
more O
than O
five O
to O
ten O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
. O

They O
're O
easy O
, O
fun O
, O
powerful O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

But O
Sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O
it O
back O
and O
be O
charged O
for O
adding B-AS
the I-AS
bluetooth I-AS
an O
additional O
seventy O
something O
dollars O
. O

Then O
to O
make O
matters O
worst O
, O
there O
is O
noone O
that O
they O
can O
transfer O
you O
to O
. O

The O
right B-AS
speaker I-AS
did O
not O
work O
. O

Note O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
ordinarily O
take O
the O
time O
to O
write O
a O
review O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

The O
system B-AS
it O
comes O
with O
does O
not O
work O
properly O
, O
so O
when O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
problems O
with O
it O
it O
started O
not O
working O
at O
all O
. O

Great O
, O
quick O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
or O
problems O
with O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
so O
far O
, O
and O
it O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
was O
when O
I O
first O
bought O
it O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
serious O
gaming B-AS
laptop O
or O
a O
serious O
media O
machine O
; O

Finally O
, O
I O
should O
note O
that O
I O
took O
the O
2GB B-AS
RAM I-AS
stick I-AS
from O
my O
old O
EeePC O
and O
installed O
it O
before O
I O
even O
powered O
on O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
! O

I O
'm O
pleased O
. O

so O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
work B-AS
on O
the O
24 O
twenty O
fourth O
day O
is O
my O
fault O
. O

They O
are O
closed O
at O
9pm O
eastern O
. O

I O
think O
just O
going O
from O
PC O
to O
Mac O
has O
gotten O
me O
totally O
spoiled O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
ever O
going O
back O
. O

Yeah O
, O
to O
you O
. O

I O
now O
realize O
that O
my O
$ O
900 O
would O
have O
been O
better O
spent O
on O
a O
Windows B-AS
laptop O
. O

If O
anything O
, O
I O
would O
only O
suggest O
using O
one O
of O
these O
laptops O
if O
only O
you O
have O
to O
. O

Everything O
about O
the O
Mac O
is O
not O
only O
visually O
appealing O
, O
but O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
. O

this O
computer O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
any O
pc O
but O
it O
will O
last O
you O
longer O
and O
it O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

with O
the O
switch B-AS
being O
at O
the O
top O
you O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O
key O
combination O
rather O
than O
just O
flicking O
a O
switch B-AS
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O
ability O
, O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O
to O
one O
of O
the O
more O
robust O
versions O
of O
Win B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
grab O
a O
2GB B-AS
stick I-AS
of I-AS
memory I-AS
to O
spice O
it O
all O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

i O
needed O
one O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry B-AS
to O
work O
everyday O
and O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
fit O
all O
of O
the O
criteria O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
design O
family O
so O
it O
only O
made O
sense O
. O

I O
already O
have O
a O
HP O
laptop O
I O
bought O
last O
year O
that O
's O
standard O
size B-AS
. O

I O
went O
to O
my O
local O
Best O
Buy O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
since O
mine O
broke O
. O

Still O
pretty O
pricey O
, O
but O
I O
've O
been O
putting O
off O
money O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
little O
Macbook O
Fund O
, O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
use O
it O
. O

This O
computer O
is O
really O
fast O
and O
I O
'm O
shocked O
as O
to O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
get O
used O
to O
... O

I O
've O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
the O
performance B-AS
for O
such O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
memory B-AS
. O

Worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

2nd O
Best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches B-AS
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

It O
does O
not O
keep O
internet B-AS
signals I-AS
no O
matter O
where O
you O
bring O
it O
. O

I O
have O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
online O
sources O
to O
help O
me O
but O
think O
that O
I O
would O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
quicker O
if O
I O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
class O
. O

We O
paid O
for O
the O
three B-AS
year I-AS
warranty I-AS
and O
the O
extended B-AS
warranty I-AS
after O
that O
one O
ended O
as O
well O
. O

I O
paid O
about O
the O
same O
for O
my O
Toshiba O
as O
I O
did O
for O
the O
compaq O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

Microsoft O
seems O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
repairs O
for O
the O
multitude O
of O
windows B-AS
problems O
. O

I O
visited O
the O
Apple O
Store O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
17- O
inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

The O
Macbook O
is O
also O
made O
better O
, O
my O
computer O
has O
never O
got O
a O
virus O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
runs B-AS
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
first O
day O
I O
bought O
it O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
to O
handle B-AS
and O
operate B-AS
at O
school O
. O

I O
took O
the O
laptop O
home O
and O
not O
even O
a O
month O
later O
, O
I O
began O
to O
have O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

Supplied B-AS
software I-AS
: O
The O
software B-AS
that O
comes O
with O
this O
machine O
is O
greatly O
welcomed O
compared O
to O
what O
Windows B-AS
comes O
with O
. O

HAVING O
HAD O
EXPERIENCE O
WITH O
A O
TOSHIBA O
LAPTOP O
, O
I O
WAS O
DISAPPOINTED O
TO O
FIND O
THAT O
THE O
TOSHIBA O
NB305 O
LAPTOP O
HAS O
MAJOR O
PROBLEMS O
. O

Processor B-AS
- O
When O
compared O
to O
my O
3 O
week O
old O
Early O
2011 O
edition O
there O
I O
barely O
experience O
any O
difference O
in O
performance B-AS
( O
2.3 O
GHz O
v O
/ O
s O
2.4 O
GHz O
) O
. O

I O
did O
contact O
HP O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
I O
am O
. O

Love O
it O
so O
far O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
acer B-AS
arcade I-AS
but O
these O
were O
reallythe O
only O
two O
things O
I O
liked O
about O
this O
laptop O
. O

Its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features B-AS
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O
computer O
. O

The O
new O
Macbook O
Pro O
15 O
inch O
i7 O
is O
nothing O
short O
of O
amazing O
. O

With O
a O
mac O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus B-AS
software I-AS
or O
firewall B-AS
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
. O

Great O
product O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
great O
graphics B-AS
. O

now O
he O
mows O
yards O
so O
he O
can O
earn O
the O
money O
for O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

I O
love O
the O
Apple O
products O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
I O
like O
playing O
online O
games B-AS
, O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature B-AS
where O
I O
can O
dualboot O
Windows B-AS
. O

Can O
listen O
to O
my O
music O
and O
watch O
my O
videos O
with O
ease O
and O
with O
a O
great O
display B-AS
. O

Awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O
. O

also O
it O
comes O
with O
very O
useful O
applications B-AS
like O
iphoto B-AS
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
photo B-AS
application I-AS
i O
have O
ever O
had O

It O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
PORTABLE O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
checking O
out O
this O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
. O

He O
LEFT O
ME O
, O
instructions O
on O
what O
to O
do O
when O
this O
comes O
up O
, O
or O
that O
comes O
up O
... O
... O

( O
You O
may O
be O
reading O
one O
now O
! O

I O
was O
getting O
extrememly O
frustrated O
when O
I O
would O
want O
to O
do O
these O
simple O
taks O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
for O
things O
to O
download O
or O
virus O
that O
would O
clog O
up O
my O
PC O
. O

I O
WANT O
MY O
L505- O
s5988 O
BACK O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

However O
I O
dealt O
with O
this O
problem O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
it O
was O
more O
of O
a O
hastle O
then O
I O
have O
EVER O
had O
with O
anything O
. O

it O
has O
had O
some O
problems O
. O

Great O
product O
. O

Compared O
to O
similarly O
spec O
'd O
PCs O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
good O
value B-AS
, O
well O
built B-AS
and O
works B-AS
easily O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
this O
computer O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
vga B-AS
port I-AS
so O
I O
can O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
bigger O
screen B-AS
. O

My O
review O
mainly O
talks O
about O
the O
difference O
I O
have O
felt O
between O
an O
early O
2011 O
and O
late O
2011 O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

Whenever O
tried O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
it O
would O
restart O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
BIOS B-AS
launched O
Windows B-AS
( O
or O
Winblows O
, O
as O
I O
like O
ot O
call O
it O
) O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
, O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
expensive O
shipping B-AS
to O
and O
from O
HP O
. O

It O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
trouble O
from O
the O
time O
we O
bought O
it O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
ran B-AS
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O
. O

Very O
long O
- O
life O
battery B-AS
( O
up O
to O
10 O
- O
11 O
hours O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
configure O
power O
level O
settings O
) O
. O

Also O
, O
macbooks O
come O
with O
much O
more O
features B-AS
which O
are O
so O
cool O
! O

They O
say O
sorry O
out O
of O
warranty B-AS
. O

The O
AC B-AS
power I-AS
port I-AS
becomes O
loose O
over O
time O

this O
one O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O
! O

Acer O
has O
set O
me O
up O
with O
FREE O
recovery B-AS
discs I-AS
, O
when O
they O
are O
available O
since O
I O
asked O
. O

The O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
crashed O
as O
well O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
power B-AS
cord I-AS
. O

It O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
investments O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

I O
was O
informed O
that O
I O
need O
to O
call O
some O
0900 O
number O
first O
. O

It O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-AS
and O
navigate B-AS
. O

I O
have O
had O
to O
call O
with O
a O
few O
questions O
or O
issues O
and O
they O
have O
helped O
me O
for O
free O
, O
even O
without O
the O
warranty B-AS
. O

its O
more O
like O
a O
snail O
crawl O
. O

I O
never O
have O
had O
a O
good O
result O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

I O
have O
had O
another O
Mac O
, O
but O
it O
got O
slow O
due O
to O
an O
older O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
. O

Everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
Mac B-AS
software I-AS
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
Microsoft B-AS
software I-AS
. O

If O
you O
faintly O
come O
close O
to O
touching O
this O
thing O
while O
typing O
, O
all O
craziness O
may O
break O
loose O
. O

They O
definitely O
have O
a O
superior O
product O
! O

They O
told O
me O
to O
reprogram O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
pictures O
of O
my O
oldests O
first O
2 O
years O
of O
her O
life O
. O

Took O
me O
11 O
hours O
, O
3 O
trips O
to O
different O
FedEx O
offices O
, O
and O
brutal O
conversations O
with O
14 O
of O
the O
worse O
IT B-AS
support I-AS
technicians I-AS
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
the O
screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web B-AS
browsing I-AS
. O

Theres O
always O
something O
wrong O
with O
it O
, O
wether O
it O
be O
some O
virus O
you O
ca O
n't O
track O
down O
, O
or O
it O
overheats O
, O
sometimes O
even O
catches O
on O
fire O
, O
you O
just O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
. O

And O
the O
screen B-AS
on O
this O
thing O
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
for O
high O
quality O
videos O
and O
movies O
and O
gaming B-AS
. O

Keys B-AS
stick O
periodically O
and O
I O
havent O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O
. O

I O
own O
other O
Macs O
but O
always O
find O
myself O
navigation O
to O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
to O
get O
my O
work O
done O
. O

Second O
HDD B-AS
cover I-AS
has O
walls O
inside O
that O
need O
to O
be O
broken O
if O
you O
what O
to O
install O
one O
. O

This O
unit O
is O
not O
. O

I O
made O
a O
perfect O
decision O
when O
I O
bought O
the O
Toshiba O
! O

So O
far O
, O
it O
's O
an O
average O
laptop O
- O
no O
better O
, O
no O
worse O
than O
the O
HP O
I O
replaced O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
go O
back O
and O
return O
at O
Store O
I O
bought O
from O
! O

I O
am O
just O
amazed O
. O

So O
I O
called O
Compaq O
, O
and O
after O
being O
on O
the O
phone O
for O
3 O
hours O
, O
i O
finally O
got O
a O
replacement O
which O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
getting O
since O
it O
was O
under O
warranty B-AS
. O

I O
had O
my O
IWORKS B-AS
, O
Itunes B-AS
, O
Email O
, O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

Is O
this O
partially O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
running O
Windows B-AS
Vista I-AS
? O

The O
neat O
and O
organized O
icon B-AS
list I-AS
is O
a O
welcome O
change O
from O
cluttered O
and O
confusing O
desktop B-AS
icons I-AS
. O

They O
do O
n't O
crash O
. O

I O
brought O
this O
laptop O
last O
friday O
, O
and O
originally O
it O
worked O
fantastic O
. O

But O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
iLife B-AS
is O
great O
and O
I O
love O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
X I-AS
. O

I O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
reports O
that O
the O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
, O
it O
's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
and O
the O
response B-AS
for O
the O
computing O
she O
's O
doing O
( O
Internet B-AS
focused I-AS
activity I-AS
: O
mail O
, O
research O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
is O
excellent O
; O

The O
difference O
is O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
fun O
using O
the O
laptop O
now O
, O
still O
learning O
the O
Apple B-AS
navigation I-AS
, O
but O
is O
fun O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
apps B-AS
. O

I O
can O
not O
even O
read O
what O
I O
am O
writing O
half O
of O
the O
time O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
it O
waited O
, O
this O
one O
is O
great O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
back O
to O
PC O
. O

I O
had O
upgraded O
my O
old O
MacBook O
to O
Lion O
, O
so O
I O
kind O
of O
knew O
what O
I O
was O
getting O
, O
but O
had O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
of O
the O
awesome O
new O
multi B-AS
- I-AS
touch I-AS
features I-AS
. O

But O
other O
than O
that O
I O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
all O
the O
features B-AS
this O
laptop O
offers O
. O

To O
list O
a O
few O
: O
They O
tend O
to O
get O
hot O
enough O
to O
cause O
3rd O
degree O
burns O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ignite O
any O
flamable O
material O
if O
near O
the O
part O
that O
happens O
to O
heat O
up O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
luxury O
( O
sarcasm O
) O
of O
owning O
2 O
of O
these O
laptops O
. O

I O
am O
very O
Happy O
! O

It O
's O
A O
MAC O
! O
! O

I O
would O
n't O
play O
a O
first O
- O
person O
shooter O
with O
this O
, O
mind O
, O
but O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
run O
MS B-AS
Office I-AS
, O
email O
, O
chat O
, O
download O
a O
video O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
from O
a O
certain O
fruit O
- O
named O
music O
store O
, O
and O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
highly O
portable O
yet O
powerful O
netbook O
to O
do O
that O
all O
in O
, O
I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
checking O
this O
out O
. O

the O
programs B-AS
are O
esay O
to O
use B-AS
and O
are O
quick O
to O
process O
this O
computer O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
white O
Mac O
computers O
looked O
dirty O
too O
quicly O
where O
you O
use O
the O
mousepad B-AS
and O
where O
you O
place O
your O
hands O
when O
typing O
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
great O
for O
this O
model O
, O
I O
only O
plan O
on O
using O
it O
for O
media O
in O
the O
entertainment O
room O
. O

very O
very O
slow O
laptop O
. O

, O
which O
Apple O
does O
n't O
offer O
, O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
my O
MacBook O
at O
Best O
Buy O
. O

Awesome O
graphics B-AS
! O

On O
two O
occasions O
the O
computer O
s O
calendar O
told O
me O
it O
was O
1969 O
. O

Its O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
and O
the O
top O
service B-AS
from O
Apple O
- O
be O
it O
their O
phone B-AS
assistance I-AS
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius B-AS
bar I-AS
- O
can O
not O
be O
beat O
. O

If O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
Customer B-AS
Service I-AS
then O
I O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
! O

Loaded O
with O
bloatware B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
all O
for O
saving O
money O
but O
Dell O
needs O
to O
step O
it O
up O
. O

The O
other O
day O
I O
had O
a O
presentation O
to O
do O
for O
a O
seminar O
at O
a O
large O
conference O
in O
town- O
lots O
of O
people O
, O
little O
time O
to O
prep O
and O
have O
to O
set O
up O
a O
computer O
to O
a O
projector O
, O
etc O
. O

After O
replacing O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
the O
battery B-AS
stopped O
working O
( O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
) O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

I O
think O
this O
computer O
is O
super O
lame O
. O

This O
was O
the O
second O
computer O
and O
brand O
bought O
that O
day O
. O

I O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
fix O
in O
perfect O
condition O
but O
for O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

Good O
price B-AS
. O

It O
would O
not O
let O
me O
connect O
to O
my O
Wifi O
system O
where O
I O
lived O
. O

ANd O
I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
just O
one O
day O
when O
i O
opened O
it O
turned O
it O
on O
went O
to O
click O
and O
it O
was O
broke O
. O

I O
like O
the O
laptop O
overall O
. O

My O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
efficient O
than O
a O
PC O
so O
it O
does O
not O
need O
the O
extra O
bells O
and O
whistles O
to O
compete O
. O

And O
it O
did O
n't O
show O
up O
on O
the O
reciept O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
we O
ordered O
it O
online O
! O

It O
's O
applications B-AS
are O
terrific O
, O
including O
the O
replacements O
for O
Microsoft B-AS
office I-AS
. O

The O
latest O
and O
mightiest O
Macbook O
pro O
17- O
inch O
was O
bought O
by O
my O
university O
on O
the O
30th O
of O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

You O
just O
lose O
a O
customer O
. O

If O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
my O
apple O
items O
I O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
one O
of O
my O
local O
stores O
and O
they O
work O
on O
correcting O
it O
right O
there O
. O

Wasted O
me O
at O
least O
8 O
hours O
of O
installation B-AS
time I-AS
. O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
but O
i O
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O
. O

I O
have O
loved O
this O
since O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
generic O
brand O
computer O
but O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

( O
For O
those O
old O
enough O
to O
remember O
, O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
Beta O
versus O
VHS O
. O

The O
dv4 O
boasted O
a O
faster O
processor B-AS
, O
more O
memory B-AS
, O
and O
a O
bigger O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
than O
my O
old O
computer O
, O
plus O
a O
better O
quality O
web B-AS
cam I-AS
, O
nicer O
screen B-AS
, O
and O
many O
other O
features B-AS
. O

The O
notebook O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
again O
. O

A O
SECOND O
PROBLEM O
INVOLVES O
THE O
BATTERY B-AS
WHICH O
IS O
ADVERTISED O
AS O
HAVING O
A O
STORAGE B-AS
LIFE I-AS
OF O
11 O
HOURS O
BUT O
WHEN O
FULLY O
CHARGED O
SHOWS O
ONLY O
7 O
HOURS O
OF O
SERVICE B-AS
. O

After O
doing O
extensive O
research O
, O
macconnection O
had O
the O
lowest O
price B-AS
on O
the O
15 O
'' O
MBP O
i5 O
. O

I O
occassionaly O
use O
it O
for O
work O
via O
VPN O
and O
it O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

I O
dont O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
product O
worth O
purchasing O
. O

When O
I O
am O
next O
to O
my O
router O
on O
my O
HP O
I O
get O
full B-AS
service I-AS
, O
on O
my O
Eee O
PC O
I O
get O
3 O
bars O
. O

I O
was O
said O
it O
's O
videocard B-AS
. O

I O
love O
a O
`` O
pc O
'' O
but O
I O
was O
ready O
for O
a O
change O
and O
tired O
of O
the O
windows B-AS
system I-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Our O
Apple O
13.3 O
MacBook O
Pro O
Notebook O
Computer O
( O
Z0J80001 O
) O
Notebook O
and O
has O
become O
such O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
completing O
our O
daily O
needs O
and O
social O
networking O
. O

I O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30 B-AS
'' I-AS
HD I-AS
Monitor I-AS
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen B-AS
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

I O
burned O
my O
leg O
, O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
, O
and O
for O
less O
than O
5 O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
, O
so O
I O
can O
place O
it O
there O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
wear O
- O
and O
- O
tear O
issue O
, O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
they O
CA O
N'T O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service B-AS
and O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
. O

I O
returned O
it O
to O
Best O
Buy O
on O
the O
ninteenth O
of O
April O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
cordless B-AS
mouse I-AS
for O
it O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
always O
take O
it O
out O
; O

The O
Nortons B-AS
virus I-AS
scan I-AS
is O
only O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
unlike O
others O
that O
usually O
are O
good O
for O
a O
year O
. O

I O
should O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
them O
then O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
quality B-AS
of O
a O
mac O
is O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
. O

the O
headphone B-AS
and O
mic B-AS
jack I-AS
are O
in O
front O
of O
touch B-AS
- I-AS
pad I-AS
making O
the O
touch B-AS
- I-AS
pad I-AS
hard O
to O
use O
when O
using O
headphones B-AS
/ O
mic B-AS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
laptop O
was O
designed O
for O
right O
handed O
person O
. O

Mostly O
I O
love O
the O
drag B-AS
and I-AS
drop I-AS
feature I-AS
. O

The O
battery B-AS
holds O
up O
well O
, O
it O
's O
built B-AS
very O
solidly O
, O
and O
runs B-AS
fast O
. O

Bought O
this O
gateway O
M- O
50 O
or O
150 O
early O
2007 O
. O

I O
am O
now O
frustrated O
that O
I O
still O
have O
to O
use O
my O
work O
issued O
Windows O
laptop O
! O

When O
I O
turned O
it O
on O
, O
nothing O
. O

I O
should O
have O
spent O
an O
extra O
hundred O
bucks O
and O
got O
a O
full O
sized O
computer O
. O

Skype B-AS
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O
. O

Keyboard B-AS
is O
reasonable O
size B-AS
. O

Easy O
to O
start B-AS
up I-AS
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
. O

Easy O
learning O
curve O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price B-AS
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features B-AS
. O

I O
like O
this O
machine O
because O
its O
very O
lightweight O
... O

the O
speed B-AS
is O
fine O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price B-AS
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look B-AS
. O

Just O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
graphics B-AS
is O
not O
dedicated O
so O
loading O
the O
movie O
almost O
took O
a O
minute O
, O
but O
it O
ran O
fairly O
smooth O
for O
a O
non B-AS
- I-AS
dedicated I-AS
graphics I-AS
card I-AS
. O

I O
have O
had O
it O
9 O
months O
and O
it O
is O
already O
a O
$ O
250 O
loss O
. O

But O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

At O
16 O
months O
it O
started O
shutting O
off O
after O
only O
5 O
or O
10 O
minutes O
. O

This O
time O
the O
mouse B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
right B-AS
click I-AS
key I-AS
would O
n't O
work O
! O

I O
like O
those O
programs B-AS
better O
than O
Office B-AS
and O
you O
can O
save O
your O
files O
to O
be O
completely O
compatible O
with O
the O
Office B-AS
programs I-AS
as O
well O
. O

It O
took O
Toshiba B-AS
tech I-AS
support I-AS
4 O
calls O
and O
4 O
different O
techs B-AS
to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
one O
and O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
bad O
video B-AS
card I-AS
unreliable O
overall O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
second O
time O
returning O
this O
laptop O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
the O
suspicious O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
problem O
. O

I O
bought O
my O
macbook O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
my O
baby O
ever O
since O
. O

The O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
disappointed O
in O
that O
because O
communicating O
with O
my O
relatives O
out O
of O
the O
area O
is O
a O
priority O
. O

Perfect O
trifecta O
! O

I O
returned O
the O
2nd O
laptop O
for O
a O
full O
refund O
. O

Now O
17 O
months O
later O
they O
want O
( O
would O
not O
say O
exact O
amount O
) O
$ O
165.00 O
to O
$ O
400 O
to O
fix O
the O
machine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
complaint O
. O

At O
first O
it O
's O
like O
you O
're O
in O
that O
honeymoon O
stage O
with O
your O
laptop O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
open O
a O
program B-AS
first O
and O
the O
cliick O
open O
or O
import O
. O

I O
recently O
purchased O
the O
mini O
and O
absolutely O
love O
it O
! O

) O
I O
also O
tried O
the O
touch B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
compared O
it O
to O
other O
netbooks O
in O
the O
store O
. O

I O
had O
to O
re O
- O
install O
Windows B-AS
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
purchase O
and O
soon O
discovered O
cracks O
in O
the O
screen B-AS
hinges I-AS
. O

Enjoy O
that O
Toshib O
force B-AS
and O
durability B-AS
unparalleled O

iPhotos B-AS
is O
an O
excellent O
program B-AS
for O
storing O
and O
organizing O
photos O
. O

Quite O
simply O
this O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

Good O
luck O
. O

Charger B-AS
seems O
large O
for O
this O
class O
of O
computer O
. O

I O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
in O
college O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
. O

I O
claim O
that O
this O
has O
no O
value O
to O
me O
, O
the O
laptop O
was O
new O
anyway O
. O

* O
= O
Webcam B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
laggy O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
rebellion O
against O
PC O
in O
fact O
, O
and O
I O
am O
certainly O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

These O
new O
problems O
were O
the O
final O
straws O
; O

If O
what O
you O
need O
is O
a O
machine O
to O
do O
some O
surfing B-AS
, O
email O
checking O
, O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
, O
and O
watching O
a O
movie O
or O
two O
, O
this O
is O
the O
machine O
you O
want O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
i O
had O
to O
add O
1 O
gb O
RAM B-AS
, O
the O
computer O
was O
kinda O
slow O
. O

I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
complain O
about O
it O
not O
having O
a O
cd B-AS
drive I-AS
and O
what O
not O
because O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
, O
it O
is O
made O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
if O
you O
want O
all O
the O
other O
stuff O
get O
a O
laptop O
. O

The O
people O
there O
just O
changed O
for O
me O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
I O
got O
a O
new O
arm B-AS
piece I-AS
and O
they O
did O
n't O
even O
request O
for O
a O
receipt O
. O

Bought O
with O
a O
credit O
card O
. O

My O
husband O
got O
me O
this O
for O
Chrismas O
after O
getting O
me O
a O
very O
expensve O
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
work B-AS
after O
2 O
days O
. O

This O
netbook O
went O
bad O
on O
me O
after O
3 O
days O
. O

I O
use O
a O
cooling B-AS
pad I-AS
but O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
. O

This O
computer O
that O
I O
have O
has O
had O
issues O
with O
the O
keyboard B-AS
where O
it O
lost O
half O
the O
keyboard B-AS
functions I-AS
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
go O
from O
one O
keyboard B-AS
to O
another O
. O

I O
hate O
the O
display B-AS
screen I-AS
and O
I O
have O
done O
everything O
I O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

By O
Air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
Me O
. O

The O
Apple B-AS
applications I-AS
( O
ex O
. O
iPhoto B-AS
) O
are O
fun O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
really O
cool O
to O
use O
( O
unlike O
the O
competition O
) O
! O

they O
respond O
: O
`` O
your O
dissatisfaction O
is O
noted O
'' O
... O

This O
is O
an O
over O
- O
sized O
, O
18 B-AS
- I-AS
inch I-AS
laptop O
. O

We O
use O
the O
built B-AS
in I-AS
tools I-AS
often O
, O
iTunes B-AS
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iPhone O
. O

The O
capabilities O
using O
that O
program B-AS
alone O
made O
me O
want O
a O
Mac O
. O

My O
husband O
purchased O
a O
laptop O
at O
the O
same O
time O
for O
about O
$ O
300 O
less O
( O
he O
got O
a O
pc O
) O
. O

The O
machine O
has O
a O
bluray B-AS
player I-AS
the O
book B-AS
has O
no O
mention O
of O
it O
or O
how O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
your O
HDTV O
. O

The O
Hewitt O
Packard O
Pavillion O
dv6700 O
was O
my O
first O
laptop O
, O
before O
this O
I O
had O
a O
Dell O
desktop O
that O
I O
loved O
. O

I O
HATE O
this O
one O
. O

Sure O
hope O
Best O
Buy O
will O
replace O
it O
asap O
. O

Asked O
the O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
rep I-AS
. O

That O
's O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

One O
more O
tip O
, O
please O
purchase O
this O
model O
and O
get O
a O
4GB B-AS
stick I-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
to O
save O
you O
$ O
10 O

A O
month O
or O
so O
ago O
, O
the O
freaking O
motherboard B-AS
just O
died O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
to O
replace O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
. O

It O
's O
A O
MAC O
! O
! O

The O
applications B-AS
are O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
maneuver O
, O
much O
easier O
than O
any O
other O
computer O
I O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

One O
of O
them O
seems O
to O
have O
worked O
. O

I O
love O
its O
solid O
build B-AS
, O
light O
wt B-AS
and O
excellent O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
( O
for O
now O
) O
. O

I O
can O
do O
pretty O
much O
75 O
% O
of O
what O
I O
do O
on O
my O
desktop O
on O
my O
kitchen O
table O
. O

Apparently O
they O
are O
defective O
since O
they O
are O
not O
securely O
attached O
. O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
. O

It O
super O
shiny O
, O
so O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fingerprints O
easily O
. O

I O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
and O
i O
still O
do O
. O

I O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
9 O
months O
ago O
! O

I O
especially O
like O
the O
keyboard B-AS
which O
has O
chiclet O
type O
keys B-AS
. O

I O
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
out O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers B-AS
and O
the O
subwoofer B-AS
. O

It O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
many O
computers O
and O
laptops O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
updated O
is O
the O
video B-AS
, O
other O
than O
that O
you O
're O
all O
set O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
really O
sure O
I O
wanted O
to O
spend O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
! O

I O
use O
my O
friends O
and O
family O
's O
$ O
2000 O
laptops O
and O
they O
are O
fast O
and O
reliable O
and O
HP O
, O
well O
, O
I O
'll O
never O
buy O
or O
recommend O
an O
HP O
to O
anyone O
! O

Probably O
wo O
n't O
work O
either O
. O

I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
store O
and O
exchanged O
it O
for O
another O
one O
. O

I O
've O
had O
friends O
with O
Acers O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
similar O
or O
exact O
same O
problems O
. O

The O
display B-AS
is O
incredibly O
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O
than O
my O
PowerBook O
and O
very O
crisp O
. O

I O
do O
not O
experience O
a O
lot O
of O
heat O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
, O
however O
I O
would O
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O
a O
stand B-AS
however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
design B-AS
of O
the O
macbook O
as O
it O
is O
one O
very O
large O
heat B-AS
sink I-AS
. O

This O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
is O
great O
! O

Needless O
to O
say O
I O
told O
them O
No O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
day O
and O
hung O
up O
! O

I O
would O
definitely O
reccomend O
this O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
an O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
stylish O
, O
fun O
, O
awesome O
computer O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
sometimes O
the O
whole O
charger B-AS
unit I-AS
will O
decide O
not O
to O
work O
entirely O
. O

The O
large O
screen B-AS
gives O
you O
the O
option O
to O
comfortably O
watch O
movies O
or O
TV O
shows O
on O
your O
computer O
instead O
of O
buying O
an O
additional O
TV O
for O
your O
dorm O
room O
. O

My O
macbook O
is O
so O
much O
better O
looking B-AS
and O
so O
thin O
! O

I O
had O
read O
online O
that O
some O
users O
were O
having O
sound B-AS
problems O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eyes O
without O
looking O
too O
much O
like O
an O
Alienware O
gaming O
machine O
. O

They O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
, O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

I O
tell O
everyone O
that O
I O
know O
, O
friends O
, O
family O
and O
enemies O
this O
is O
the O
absolute O
worst O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
( O
Refurbished O
) O
again O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
I O
've O
had O
terrible O
experiences O
with O
HP O
. O

In O
those O
three O
years O
, O
I O
've O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
minor O
problems O
and O
both O
were O
resolved O
by O
Apple O
quickly O
and O
easily O
. O

May O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O
web O
surfer O
. O

I O
love O
how O
easy O
every O
thing O
is O
to O
do O
on O
my O
Apple O
products O
. O

All O
of O
them O
were O
Windows O
machines O
. O

So O
in O
late O
March O
, O
early O
April O
2009 O
I O
was O
without O
it O
again O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
while O
I O
had O
online O
courses O
I O
had O
to O
complete O
and O
my O
fiance O
was O
in O
Afghanistan O
and O
web O
conferencing O
was O
the O
best O
communication O
method O
we O
had O
. O

I O
am O
most O
impressed O
with O
the O
programming B-AS
, O
including O
the O
iPhoto B-AS
. O

so O
in O
a O
brief O
summary O
i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
dell O
vostro O
1000 O
to O
anyone O
due O
to O
it O
being O
a O
down O
right O
awful O
setup B-AS
so O
in O
my O
opinion O
you O
should O
steer O
clear O
of O
them O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O
laptop O
. O

But O
in O
fact O
it O
is O
totally O
the O
opposite O
. O

It O
had O
most O
of O
the O
features B-AS
and O
all O
of O
the O
power B-AS
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
machine O
. O

The O
guy O
then O
said O
that O
if O
I O
insist O
on O
having O
the O
hinge B-AS
tightened O
, O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O
me O
but O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
condition O
after O
the O
`` O
repair O
'' O
. O

It O
will O
be O
returned O
in O
the O
state O
to O
which O
it O
was O
shipped O
Michigan O
. O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O
desktop O
, O
and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
carry O
it O
around O
, O
which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
, O
or O
the O
motherboard B-AS
. O

The O
Unibody B-AS
construction I-AS
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

The O
local O
computer O
repair O
shops O
send O
out O
ads O
that O
say O
along O
the O
lines O
of O
we O
can O
fix O
almost O
any O
problem O
or O
computer O
usually O
even O
the O
trouble O
some O
Toshiba O
satellite O
. O

After O
years O
of O
using O
PCs O
, O
a O
new O
Mac O
user O
is O
basically O
forced O
to O
re- O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
a O
computer O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
help O
they O
WERE O
N'T O
! O

Windows B-AS
XP I-AS
SP2 I-AS
caused O
many O
problems O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
remove O
it O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
is O
the O
15 O
inch O
MacBook O
Pro O
has O
much O
better O
speakers B-AS
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

I O
do O
everything O
on O
this O
computer O
- O
check O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
shop O
, O
check O
blogs O
, O
write O
papers O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
, O
and O
we O
even O
watch O
all O
of O
our O
movies O
on O
it O
since O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
tv O
. O

The O
apple B-AS
care I-AS
has O
never O
failed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
computer O
as O
well O
. O

It O
's O
graphics B-AS
are O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
spectrum O
, O
easily O
capable O
of O
running O
StarCraft O
II O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O
graphics B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Mac O
, O
and O
do O
, O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

Boots B-AS

condition O
and O
operational O
, O
but O
for O
the O
audio B-AS
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O
. O

If O
only O
Bill O
Gates O
would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O
MS O
would O
do O
a O

. O

Very O
satisfied O
. O

At O
first O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
then O
the O
system B-AS
board I-AS
failed O
and O
I O
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O
some O
complaints O
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
I O
then O
receive O
my O
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
I O
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
call O
the O
support B-AS
line I-AS
at O
all O
. O

Other O
Thoughts O
: O
Received O
replacement O
16 O
Days O
later O
. O

The O
PhotoBooth B-AS
is O
a O
great O
program B-AS
, O
it O
takes O
very O
good O
pictures O
with O
the O
built B-AS
- I-AS
in I-AS
camera I-AS
. O

I O
can O
not O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
service B-AS
or O
product O
. O

After O
5 O
months O
of O
failed O
repairs O
, O
requested O
a O
full O
refund O
but O
was O
refused O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
repaired O
and O
Acer O
is O
indifferent O
to O
the O
issue O
. O

return O
it O
. O

The O
wheel B-AS
that O
turns O
the O
volume O
up O
and O
down O
does O
n't O

in O
real O
time O

Since O
I O
never O
really O
got O
to O
use O
this O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
anything O
except O
what O
went O
wrong O
after O
trying O
2 O
of O
them O
. O

Do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
fake O
story O

to O
hurt O

... O

With O
what O
I O
do O
know O
how O
to O
do O
, O
the O
computer O
works B-AS
beautiful O
. O

After O
the O
bad O
experience O
with O
this O
computer O
went O
back O
to O

Its O
still O
going O

Very O
fast O

In O

about O
10 O

Bought O

has O
been O
on O
it O
non- O

ever O
since O
`` O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
it O
'' O
. O

The O
layout B-AS
of O
the O
MacBook O
is O
horrible O
and O
confusing O
; O

The O
next O
time O
I O
had O
an O
issue O
my O
lightscribe B-AS
would O
n't O
work O
. O

3 O
) O
Horrible O
customer B-AS
support I-AS

I O
can O
see O
why O
the O
have O
soooo O
much O
money O
. O

Typing O
on O
the O
keyboard B-AS
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B-AS
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
enough O
people O
have O
Macs O
these O
days O
and O
that O
companies O
need O
to O
start O
making O
things O
more O
compatable O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
. O

It O
works B-AS
exactly O
like O
it O
did O
the O
day O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

If O
you O
could O
stretch O
by O
a O
few O
100 O
dollars O
I O
highly O
recommend O
you O
should O
replace O
your O
Windows O
laptop O
with O
this O
one O
. O

This O
was O
my O
first O
MacBook O
purchase O
ever O
. O

All O
the O
programs B-AS
are O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
on O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O
, O
which O
I O
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O
. O

It O
has O
a O
overheating O
issue O
- O
nearly O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
dangerous O
. O

I O
or O
my O
dad O
paid O
over O
twenty O
four O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
everything O
. O

It O
is O
, O
however O
, O
very O
heavy O
. O

The O
cool O
thing O
about O
the O
Mac O
Book O
was O
that O
I O
went O
on O
my O
honeymoon O
and O
shot O
a O
bunch O
of O
pictures O
and O
movies O
with O
my O
iPhone O
, O
then O
I O
came O
back O
and O
put O
them O
onto O
my O
Macbook O
and O
made O
a O
pretty O
good O
DVD O
movie O
with O
all O
the O
pictures O
and O
videos O
from O
my O
trip O
. O

Images B-AS
are O
crisp O
and O
clean O
. O

Programs B-AS
would O
crash O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
unstable O
, O
unreliable O
laptop O
for O
me O
. O

I O
'll O
wait O
and O
save O
up O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

Using O
this O
machine O
is O
like O
a O
mild O
form O
of O
torture O
. O

But O
sitting O
on O
a O
lap O
or O
on O
a O
desk O
in O
front O
of O
you O
it O
looks O
more O
than O
big O
enough O
( O
this O
could O
be O
because O
Im O
used O
to O
my O
Lenovo O
10 O
tablet O
now O
) O
plus O
this O
is O
a O
great O
size B-AS
if O
I O
want O
to O
unplug O
the O
external B-AS
keyboard I-AS
, O
mouse B-AS
, O
and O
monitor B-AS
to O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
I O
take O
photos O
and O
video O
. O

Unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O
inconvenienced O
with O
a O
non O
working O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O
attachment O
so O
small O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
until O
I O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
take O
it O
with O
me O
. O

( O
with O

kardon O
speakers B-AS
! O
) O
in O
December O
of O
2005 O
. O

i O
dont O
understand O
why O
i O
spent O
twice O
as O
much O
to O
get O
a O
laptop O
rather O
than O
a O
desktop O
when O
my O
lap O
top O
is O
completely O
immoble O
. O

The O

You O
know O
what O
? O
I O
happened O
to O
buy O
a O
defective O
blood O
pressure O
monitor O
a O
week O
ago O
at O
the O
Bukit O
Batok O
Polyclinic O
NHG O
Pharmacy O
a O
week O
ago O
. O

It O
quit O
working O
within O
a O
weeks O
time O
. O

The O
computer O
runs B-AS
very O
fast O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
the O
iLife B-AS
software I-AS
that O
comes O
with O
it O
( O
iPhoto B-AS
, O
iMovie B-AS
, O
iWeb B-AS
, O
iTunes B-AS
, O
GarageBand B-AS
) O
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

WHEN O
TYPING B-AS
, O
LETTERS O
AND O
SPACES O
ARE O
FREQUENTLY O
OMITTED O
REQUIRING O
THE O
USER O
TO O
REDO O
MANY O
WORDS O
AND O
SENTENCES O
. O

The O
keyboard B-AS
feels O
good O
and O
I O
type O
just O
fine O
on O
it O
. O

I O
previously O
owned O
a O
Toshiba O
and O
it O
only O
lasted O
about O
2 O
years O
. O

Very O
happy O
with O
my O
7th O
Toshiba O
laptop O
! O

The O
latest O
is O
on O
my O
LG O
Netbook O
X12 O

The O
software B-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

While O
it O
was O
highly O
rated O
, O
would O
I O
like O
it O
? O
I O
tried O
the O
keyboard B-AS
at O
the O
store O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
ok O
. O

I O
have O
had O
my O
MacBook O
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
and O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
I O
will O
NEVER O
buy O
another O
computer O
if O
it O
is O
not O
a O
Mac O
. O

First O
, O
you O
ll O
discover O
that O
the O
word B-AS
processing I-AS
program I-AS
known O
as O
Appleworks B-AS
rarely O
translates O
perfectly O
on O
anyone O
else O
s O
computer O
, O
if O
it O
translates O
at O
all O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
use O
a O
different O
operating B-AS
system I-AS
altogether O
. O

This O
is O
great O
if O
you O
have O
several O
lectures O
back O
to O
back O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
charge B-AS
during O
one O
of O
the O
lectures O
. O

The O
processor B-AS
went O
on O
me O
, O
the O
fan B-AS
went O
and O
the O
motherboard B-AS
went O
. O

It O
doesnt O
overheat O
or O
make O
any O
loud O
noises O
. O

I O
get O
a O
ton O
of O
compliments O
on O
its O
size B-AS
, O
and O
speaking O
as O
someone O
who O
regularly O
commutes O
on O
a O
bus O
, O
I O
can O
attest O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
size B-AS
computer O
if O
you O
're O
restricted O
to O
the O
width O
of O
your O
body O
for O
computing O
room O
. O

The O
start B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
navigate B-AS
due O
to O
the O
stacking O
. O

) O
only O
to O
get O
another O
`` O
HP/ O
Compaq O
'' O
piece O
of O
crap O
. O

The O
LED B-AS
backlit I-AS
display I-AS
makes O
my O
pictures O
pop O
so O
much O
more O
. O

Apple O
continues O
to O
shine O

Summary O
: O
HP O
knew O
they O
were O
shipping O
out O
bad O
BIOS B-AS
and O
did O
nothing O
proactive O
to O
resolve O
it O
. O

After O
2 O
months O
of O
complaints O
, O
Asus O
finally O
sent O
the O
right O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
to O
my O
techies B-AS
. O

Could O
n't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
n't O
perfect O
about O
this O
netbook O
is O
the O
speakers B-AS
, O
they O
are O
not O
loud O
at O
all O
but O
I O
expected O
that O
. O

It O
was O
a O
total O
Dhell O
experience O
that O
I O
will O
never O
repeat O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
protector B-AS
for O
my O
key B-AS
pad I-AS
and O
it O
works O
great O
: O
) O

It O
took O
so O
much O
time O
. O

I O
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
no O
laptop O
. O

They O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard B-AS
again O
, O
but O
Dell O

Finally O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
take O
it O
anymore O
and O
ordered O
my O
Apple O
. O

That O
is O
how O
it O
is O
able O
to O
function O
better O
than O
any O
other O
PC O
. O

I O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
2 O
months O
and O
I O
love O
it O
, O
I O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
I O
use O
. O

Called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
Acer O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
software B-AS
but O
for O
$ O
$ O
$ O
we O
can O
help O
you O
'' O
I O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software B-AS
involved O
in O
booting B-AS
. O

I O
let O
my O
friend O
borrow O
it O
, O
and O
she O
knows O
nothing O
about O
computers O
, O
and O
she O
used O
it O
with O
ease O
. O

PDF O
files O
can O
be O
viewed O
instantly O
. O

Each O
time O
taking O
about O
1 O
day O
or O
so O
. O

Best O
Buy O
was O
great O
as O
always O
and O
accepted O
the O
return O
and O
gave O
me O
another O
model O
1764 O
. O

However O
, O
this O
laptop O
has O
a O
fatal O
flaw O
that O
i O
discovered O
merely O
a O
week O
after O
buying O
it O
. O

Lightweight O
and O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
beautiful O
! O

But O
, O
for O
the O
cost B-AS
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

There O
is O
NO O
way O
I O
will O
buy O
a O
LG O
product O
in O
the O
future O
. O

pros O
: O
the O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
has O
a O
large O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
and O
you O
wont O
have O
to O
worry O
to O
charge O
your O
laptop O
every O
five O
hours O
or O
so O
. O

at O
first O
! O

I O
would O
recommend O
not O
buying O
this O
product O
. O

Such O
as O
PAGES O
, O
NUMBERS O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

of O
course O
my O
warranty B-AS
runs O
out O
next O
month O
. O

Take O
your O
time O
and O
go O
through O
the O
tutorials B-AS
patiently O
. O

I O
just O
hope O
the O
reputation O
that O
Toshiba O
has O
is O
true O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
crash O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
gorgeous O
. O

Many O
of O
my O
classmates O
computers O
hard B-AS
drives I-AS
crashed O
. O

and O
looks O
very O
sexyy O
: O
D O
really O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
specially O
for O
students O
in O
college O
if O
you O
are O
not O
caring O
about O
price B-AS
. O

It O
weighed B-AS
like O
seven B-AS
pounds I-AS
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
it O
getting O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
not O
even O
sitting O
on O
anything O
to O
make O
it O
hot O
. O

One O
night O
I O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
I O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
GUI B-AS
, O
screen B-AS
all O
dark O
, O
power B-AS
light I-AS
steady O
, O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
light I-AS
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

I O
just O
recently O
had O
to O
ship O
my O
laptop O
back O
to O
HP O
for O
repair O
. O

My O
previous O
purchases O
were O
with O
Dell O
and O
HP O
. O

Laptop O
is O
to O
be O
used O
like O
a O
Netbook O
. O

That O
seemed O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
, O
till O
I O
wrote O
an O
article O
with O
semicolons O
in O
it O
. O

More O
times O
that O
not O
the O
screen O
pops O
up O
saying O
I O
have O
a O
bad O
internet B-AS
connection I-AS
, O
or O
the O
page O
ca O
n't O
be O
displayed O
. O

It O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
to O
use B-AS
, O
despite O
all O
its O
so O
called O
advanced O
features B-AS
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
and O
lightweight O
. O

( O
If O
you O
ever O
see O
the O
spinning B-AS
beachball I-AS
come O
up O
when O
you O
think O
it O
should O
n't O
, O
check O
the O
`` O
Activity O
Monitor O
'' O
app O
to O
see O
if O
the O
disk B-AS
throughput I-AS
has O
temporarily O
dropped O
to O
zero O
. O

From O
the O
get O
- O
go O
, O
the O
M6809 O
was O
unsteady O
in O
its O
operation B-AS
; O

I O
have O
had O
two O
Toshiba O
satellite O
computers O
and O
while O
they O
are O
okay O
, O
they O
are O
in O
no O
way O
comparable O
to O
the O
Mac O
. O

I O
'm O
Very O
disappointed O
in O
Dell O
. O

Finally O
set O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
HP O
after O
a O
month O
of O
hell O
. O

PC O
never O
worked O
right O
even O
after O
BIOS B-AS
fixed O
. O

I O
tried O
out O
another O
Mac O
for O
a O
few O
months O
before O
buying O
this O
one O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

I O
took O
it O
in O
to O
the O
Apple O
store O
and O
guess O
what O
? O
They O
fixed O
it O
, O
no O
cost B-AS
out O
of O
pocket O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
hp O
pavillion O
and O
that O
was O
my O
replacement O
and O
now O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
going O
back O
to O
an O
acer O
at O
all O
. O

The O
screen B-AS
graphics I-AS
and O
clarity B-AS
, O
and O
sharpness B-AS
are O
great O
. O

I O
've O
saved O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
headaches O
so O
far O
, O
using O
my O
new O
MacBook O
Pro O
. O

Small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
Light O
enough O
to O
carry B-AS
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O
trips O
. O

The O
trackpad B-AS
was O
easy O
to O
learn O
and O
navigate O
. O

Ease O
of O
use B-AS
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
I O
love O
about O
my O
Mac O
. O

There O
is O
a O
little O
indent O
to O
help O
open O
it O
- O
but O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
. O

i O
think O
that O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
durrable O
laptop O
then O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

I O
go O
to O
purchase O
it O
on O
line O
, O
and O
I O
find O
out O
that O
the O
device O
will O
not O
be O
available O
until O
almost O
two O
months O
later O
! O

In O
all O
honesty O
, O
if O
someone O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
laptop O
and O
willing O
to O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
money O
for O
a O
normal O
sized B-AS
laptop O
than O
a O
cheaper O
and O
less O
impressive O
laptop O
, O
then O
do O
not O
buy O
this O
computer O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
outstanding O
in O
all O
aspects O
except O
that O
it O
has O
the O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
starter I-AS
and O
not O
the O
full O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
. O

This O
computer O
is O
absolutely O
AMAZING O
! O
! O
! O

Bigger O
HD B-AS
, O
better O
graphics B-AS
card I-AS
, O
and O
a O
bid O

. O

I O
got O
it O
back O
again O
and O
was O
told O
the O
motherboard B-AS
had O
been O
replaced O
, O
so O
I O
was O
now O
on O
the O
SECOND O
motherboard B-AS
within O
3 O
months O
. O

do O
a O
quick O
search O
on O
the O
internet O
see O
if O
im O
the O
only O
one O
. O

The O
letter B-AS
A I-AS
stopped O
working O
after O
the O
first O
week O
. O

Back O
then O
my O
entire O
family O
was O
Devoted O
to O
the O
Sony O
name O
. O

- O
Called O
MacHouse O
Amsterdam O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
temporary O
replacement O
, O
no O
answer O
. O

Got O
this O
for O
a O
graduation O
gift O
for O
my O
daughter O
for O
her O
to O
use O
at O
college O
. O

Both O
computers O
started O
acting O
extremely O
slow O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
owning O
them O
. O

I O
am O
however O
pleased O
that O
it O
is O
still O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

Not O
even O
safe B-AS
mode I-AS
boots O
. O

Instead O
of O
taking O
another O
chance O
on O
Toshiba O
, O
I O
went O
with O
an O
Asus O
G73JH- O

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O
design B-AS
flaw O

In O
summary O
, O
take O
your O
money O
elsewhere O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
! O

and O
finally O
i O
realized O
that O
mac O
is O
the O
best O
. O

The O
computer O
will O
constantly O
be O
getting O
hot O
and O
burning O
your O
leg O
unless O
you O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
taking O
off O
the O
entire O
back O
of O
it O
just O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
fan B-AS
. O

Since O
I O
keyboard O
over O
100 O
wpm O
, O
I O
look O
for O
a O
unit O
that O
has O
a O
comfortble O
keyboard B-AS
( O
no O
keys B-AS
sticking O
or O
lagging O
, O
strange O
configuration B-AS
of I-AS
`` I-AS
extra I-AS
key I-AS
'' I-AS
, O
etc O
. O

It O
is O
sleek O
and O
lightweight O
and O
charges B-AS
quickly O
when O
needed O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
next O
issue O
I O
had O
freaked O
me O
out O
. O

The O
Macbooks O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

I O
love O
the O
dock B-AS
where O
I O
can O
simply O
drop O
a O
file O
ontop O
of O
a O
particular O
program B-AS
, O
and O
the O
program B-AS
will O
simply O
open O
that O
file O
. O

We O
upgraded O
the O
memory B-AS
to O
four O
gigabytes O
in O
order O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
performace B-AS
increase O
in O
speed B-AS
. O

The O
computer O
would O
not O
ever O
cut O
back O
on O
. O

This O
computer O
literally O
takes O
about O
five O
minutes O
to O
start O
up O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
without O
it O
crawling O
and O
I O
DO O
mean O
crawling O
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
wait O
to O
see O
whats O
around O
the O
next O
corner O
. O

I O
had O
the O
computer O
for O
a O
full O
year O
and O
it O
was O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

The O
price B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
the O
product O
is O
top O
quality B-AS
. O

Anyway O
, O
in O
early O
July O
of O
this O
year O
, O
the O
DVD B-AS
burner I-AS
stopped O
working O
, O
and O
the O
computer O
stared O
having O
issues O
with O
power B-AS
supply I-AS
. O

This O
is O
perfect O
for O
her O
field O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
relatively O
simple O
to O
use B-AS
, O
though O
I O
bought O
Macs O
for O
Dummies O
, O
which O
is O
well O
worth O
$ O
2 O

pretty O
much O
everything O
else O
about O
the O
computer O
is O
good O
it O
just O
stops O
working B-AS
out O
of O
no O
were O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
that O
the O
Microsoft B-AS
Student I-AS
Edition I-AS
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
was O
a O
six O
month O
trial O
. O

It O
has O
spent O
more O
time O
in O
repair O
shops O
than O
i O
can O
possibly O
recount O
here O
. O

Overall O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-AS
, O
the O
screen B-AS
is O
perfect O
, O
great O
computer O
, O
my O
daughter O
loves O
. O

Oh O
yea O
, O
has O
no O
numeric B-AS
pad I-AS
on O
the O
side O
. O

Enough O
said O
. O

It O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
I O
would O
be O
up O
hours- O
just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
. O

I O
am O
definitely O
sold O
, O
and O
not O
going O
back O
to O
PCs O
for O
home O
use O
! O

Finally O
, O
the O
biggest O
problem O
has O
been O
tech B-AS
support I-AS
. O

I O
can O
render O
AVCHD O
movies O
with O
little O
effort O
, O
which O
was O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
pc O
's O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
quad B-AS
core I-AS
I7 I-AS
. O

Received O
all O
four O
in O
good O
order O
; O

The O
OS B-AS
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
PC O
, O
with O
a O
little O
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
this O
OS B-AS
! O

They O
click O
. O

I O
went O
right O
out O
and O
purchased O
another O
laptop O
. O

Instead O
it O
is O
sitting O
in O
West O
Verginia O
waiting O
for O
UPS O
to O
take O
two O
days O
to O
send O
Me O
a O
box O
and O
Two O
days O
for O
them O
to O
ship O
the O
computer O
some O
691 O
miles O
by O
air O
? O
to O
Louisville O
Ky O
. O

My O
battery B-AS
went O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
after O
having O
it O
and O
it O
cost O
around O
eighty O
to O
a O
hundred O
dollars O
! O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
MacBooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B-AS
enclosure I-AS
- O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge B-AS
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
( O
very O
clever O
con O
) O
. O

I O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
. O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

I O
've O
only O
had O
mine O
a O
day O
but O
I O
'm O
already O
used O
to O
it O
... O

The O
internet B-AS
was O
locekd O
and O
froze O
every O
time O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
be O
used O
, O
and O
the O
command B-AS
prompt I-AS
would O
not O
work O
at O
all O
. O

It O
has O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
for O
power B-AS
, O
storage B-AS
, O
and O
abilitiy B-AS
. O

I O
never O
had O
this O
kind O
of O
quality B-AS
issue O
with O
Dell O
( O
not O
to O
say O
Dell O
is O
that O
great O
) O
, O
not O
with O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
G4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O
laptop O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
photo B-AS
detection I-AS
software I-AS
that O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
group O
all O
the O
photos O
together O
based O
upon O
the O
people O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
my O
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O
there O
are O
programs B-AS
that O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
I O
am O
not O
able O
to O
. O

Screen B-AS
size I-AS
is O
perfect O
for O
portable O
use O
in O
any O
environment O
. O

They O
ended O
up O
keeping O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
3 O
months O
! O

The O
best O
thing O
is O
even O
while O
doing O
almost O
ten O
or O
twenty O
things O
at O
once O
, O
it O
never O
slows O
down O
. O

I O
reloaded O
with O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Ultimate I-AS
, O
and O
the O
Bluetooth B-AS
and O
Fingerprint B-AS
reader I-AS
( O
software B-AS
) O
would O
not O
load O
. O

By O
week O
two O
, O
my O
laptop O
had O
overheated O
and O
was O
completely O
dead O
even O
though O
I O
did O
not O
use O
it O
too O
much O
. O

If O
you O
buy O
, O
pray O
you O
dont O
have O
major O
prolems O
. O

With O
notes O
saying O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-AS
drive I-AS
. O

This O
computer O
is O
the O
ideal O
college O
companion O
. O

How O
Toshiba O
handles O
the O
repair B-AS
seems O
to O
vary O
, O
some O
folks O
indicate O
that O
they O
were O
charged O
for O
even O
an O
intial O
fix O
, O
others O
had O
the O
repair B-AS
done O
5 O
times O
. O

I O
definitely O
will O
buy O
a O
Mac O
again O
if O
and O
when O
this O
computer O
ever O
fails O
. O

The O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
the O
versitility B-AS
is O
outstanding O
. O

If O
your O
time O
is O
worth O
anything O
to O
you O
, O
if O
you O
are O
tired O
of O
rebooting O
, O
reformatting O
, O
reinstalling O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
drivers B-AS
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
to O
work O
for O
you O
for O
a O
change O
, O
make O
the O
change O
to O
this O
computer O
. O

It O
has O
just O
enough O
RAM B-AS
to O
run O
smoothly O
and O
enough O
memory B-AS
to O
satisfy O
my O
needs O
. O

All O
of O
the O
programs B-AS
( O
Keynote B-AS
, O
Pages B-AS
, O
Numbers B-AS
) O
have O
an O
option O
to O
save O
your O
documents O
as O
Microsoft O
compatible O
, O
which O
really O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
the O
actual O
. O

For O
the O
price B-AS
and O
what O
I O
get O
out O
of O
it O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

Was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price B-AS
i O
paid O
. O

I O
have O
owned O
macbook O
pros O
since O
2005 O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
yet O
! O

I O
am O
enjoying O
it O
and O
the O
quality B-AS
it O
provides O
is O
great O
! O

The O
Computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair B-AS
depot I-AS
stinks O
. O

First O
the O
screen B-AS
goes O
completely O
out O
. O

Taking O
it O
anywhere O
was O
a O
pain O
! O

I O
love O
the O
keyboard B-AS
. O

This O
ai O
n't O
it O
. O

And O
Toshiba O
is O
totally O
unconcerned O
. O

the O
only O
fact O
i O
dont O
like O
about O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O
use O
safari B-AS
and O
i O
dont O
use O
safari B-AS
but O
after O
i O
install O
Mozzilla B-AS
firfox I-AS
i O
love O
every O
single O
bit O
about O
it O
. O

But O
with O
A O
WAY O
Bigger O
Screen B-AS
, O
and O
IS O
able O
to O
connect O
to O
an O
HDMI B-AS
. O

another O
problem O
. O

With O
all O
the O
goodies O
inside O
this O
machine O
, O
it O
is O
a O
value O
. O

The O
advantages O
of O
owning O
'a O
'mac O
are O
numerous O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
Acer O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
MSFT O
. O

Got O
the O
computer O
back O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
was O
still O
broken O
sent O
it O
out O
again O
and O
they O
repaired O
it O
. O

At O
first O
when O
I O
got O
this O
product O
, O
I O
loved O
it O
. O

Upgrading O
from O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Starter I-AS
, O
thru O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Home I-AS
Premium I-AS
, O
to O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
Professional I-AS
was O
a O
snap O
; O

There O
are O
no O
viruses O
or O
spyware O
to O
worry O
about O
like O
on O
a O
Windows B-AS
computer O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
several O
calls O
lasting O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
with O
promises O
to O
call O
back O
, O
but O
the O
return O
calls O
never O
came O
. O

I O
my O
wife O
is O
also O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
Macbook O
as O
well O
! O

Pretty O
disappointed O
about O
this O
product O
. O

EITHER O
THE O
COMPUTER O
IS O
TOO O
SLOW O
TO O
DETECT O
THE O
KEYS B-AS
TYPED O
( O
THIS O
IS O
UNLIKELY O
AS O
I O
AM O
A O
SLOW O
TYPIST O
) O
OR O
THE O
KEYBOARD B-AS
SIMPLY O
DOES O
NOT O
DETECT O
THE O
KEYS B-AS
BEING O
TYPED O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
is O
running O
Snow B-AS
Leopard I-AS
, O
2.4 O
GHz O
C2D O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
antiquated O
CPU B-AS
and O
thus O
the O
occasional O
spinning B-AS
wheel I-AS
would O
appear O
when O
running O
Office B-AS
Mac I-AS
applications I-AS
such O
as O
Word B-AS
or O
Excel B-AS
. O

For O
me O
, O
five O
stars O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

I O
got O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
all O
the O
stuff O
I O
need O
to O
do O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
system B-AS
quitting O
on O
me O
or O
freezing O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

The O
computer O
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery B-AS
because O
HP O
forgot O
to O
complete O
the O
required O
import O
paperwork O
. O

The O
2 B-AS
GB I-AS
of I-AS
RAM I-AS
is O
plenty O
, O
able O
to O
run O
Windows B-AS
7 I-AS
and O
at O
least O
2 O
or O
3 O
other O
programs B-AS
with O
next O
to O
no O
slowdown O
. O

Trying O
to O
balance O
all O
of O
my O
roles O
leaves O
very O
little O
time O
for O
me O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
so O
I O
want O
to O
manage O
my O
time O
I O
do O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
efficient O
. O

I O
WILL O
NEVER O
AGAIN O
buy O
another O
Acer O
, O
not O
will O
I O
buy O
Gateway O
, O
or O
eMachine O
as O
they O
are O
all O
from O
the O
same O
company O
. O

Some O
problems O
can O
be O
fixed O
if O
you O
purchase O
new O
software B-AS
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
guarentee O
. O

After O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service B-AS
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
. O

WILL O
NOT O
EVERY O
BUY O
ANOTHER- O

LOU O

Speakers B-AS
does O
n't O
sound O
that O
great O
. O

But O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O
operation B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
I O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
. O

It O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
memory B-AS
and O
a O
great O
battery B-AS
life I-AS
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
cost B-AS
more O
, O
but O
they O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
it O
in O
speed B-AS
, O
construction B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
and O
longevity B-AS
. O

They O
break O
down O
just O
as O
often O
as O
PCs O
do O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
viruses O
, O
is O
because O
no O
one O
makes O
viruses O
for O
them O
, O
they O
're O
not O
better O
in O
any O
way O
, O
they O
are O
worse O
, O
try O
finding O
virus B-AS
protection I-AS
programs I-AS
for I-AS
a I-AS
Mac I-AS
, O
they O
do O
n't O
exist O
. O

Support B-AS
has O
been O
lackluster O
and O
now O
I O
just O
want O
a O
refund O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
3 O
days O
ago O
. O

Still O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
for O
all O
day O
use O
at O
school O
and O
work O
. O

Eventually O
the O
screen O
went O
blank O
and O
the O
computer O
would O
not O
turn O
on O
. O

keys B-AS
are O
all O
in O
weird O
places O
and O
is O
way O
too O
large O
for O
the O
way O
it O
is O
designed B-AS
. O

It O
came O
alot O
faster O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
which O
was O
really O
exciting O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
a O
satellite B-AS
card I-AS
which O
is O
why O
I O
bought O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

I O
could O
have O
purchased O
a O
cheap O
computer O
to O
do O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
now O
! O

Looks B-AS
nice O
, O
but O
has O
a O
horribly O
cheap O
feel B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
reports O
the O
notebook O
is O
astonishing O
in O
performance B-AS
, O
picture B-AS
quality I-AS
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use B-AS
. O

Again O
- O
windows B-AS
based O
machines O
were O
not O
giving O
me O
anything O
to O
work O
with O
! O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

Sony O
, O
Acer O
, O
Dell O
, O
Packard O
Bell O
and O
Toshiba O
. O

You O
may O
soon O
mistake O
my O
digitus O
medius O
as O
a O
lively O
pogo O
stick O
. O

Frustrated O
I O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2- O
3 O
days O
for O
turnaround O
time O
. O

It O
's O
software B-AS
and O
speed B-AS
enable O
it O
to O
do O
amazing O
things O
. O

The O
one O
down O
side O
to O
it O
is O
that O
when O
I O
play O
a O
certin O
game O
on O
here O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
freeze O
up O
sometimes O
, O
but O
thats O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
computer O
. O
