I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-AS
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

It O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
was O
incredible O
last O
night O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B-AS
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
must O
visit O
! O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great O
! O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

While O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland B-AS
Brewery I-AS
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

The O
takeout B-AS
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

$ O
170 O
down O
the O
toilet O
... O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food O
art O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary O
, O
birthday O
, O
valentines O
day O
... O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
great O
staff B-AS
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
egg B-AS
custards I-AS
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O
and O
helpful O
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami- O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste- O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

The O
baked B-AS
clams I-AS
octopus I-AS
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-AS
with O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
casual O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

The O
lamb B-AS
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
divine O
! O
! O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

Very O
pleased O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` B-AS

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O

in O
NY O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O

if O
you O

prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O

its O
the O
best O

Not O

is O
the O

the O
best O
around O
, O
the O

has O
always O
been O
attentive O

the O
Hudson O

of O

. O

whoever O
the O
jazz B-AS
duo I-AS
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O

with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O

great O
food B-AS

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

Gross O
food B-AS
– O
Wow O
- O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-AS
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

My O
fav O
was O
the O
sassy B-AS
lassi I-AS
... O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-AS

Go O
to O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-AS
Hand I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

you O
should O
travel O
from O
the O
Bronx O
to O
try O
it O
... O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-AS
room I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-AS
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-AS
Pomodori I-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
to O
everyone O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

There O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
but- O
worth- O
it O
'' O
and O
there O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
and- O
WTF O
'' O
? O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
there O
's O
hookah B-AS
. O

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world- O
beater O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-AS
. O

Thank O
you O
everyone O
at O
Water B-AS
's I-AS
Edge I-AS
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

( O
The O
asparagus B-AS
, I-AS
truffle I-AS
oil I-AS
, I-AS
parmesan I-AS
bruschetta I-AS
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

the O
salads B-AS
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-AS
! O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

Nice O
view B-AS
of I-AS
river I-AS
and I-AS
NYC I-AS
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-AS
. O

The O
lunch B-AS
buffet I-AS
is O
expensive O
but O
is O
deff O
worth O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

This O
dish B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

You O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non B-AS
- I-AS
veg I-AS
selections I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
amazing O
service B-AS
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
class O
act O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

This O
place O
was O
reccomended O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

Come O
on O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

Planet B-AS
Thailand I-AS
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

peppers O
, O
onions O
, O
relish O
, O
chilli O
, O
cheeses O
, O
you O
NAME O
it O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-AS
. O

Love O
the O
scene B-AS
first O
off O
- O
the O
place B-AS
has O
a O
character O
and O
nice O
light O
to O
it..very O
fortunate O
, O
location B-AS
wise O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Their O
tuna B-AS
tartar I-AS
appetizer I-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Raymond B-AS
the O
bartender O
rocks O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY- O
- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

Great O
service B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

I O
came O
across O
Village B-AS
Underground I-AS
by O
accident O
, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-AS
of I-AS
gari I-AS
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

The O
Steak B-AS
Tartare I-AS
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

i O
love O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
– O
i O
looove O
east B-AS
village I-AS
pizza I-AS

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
... O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

And O
$ O
11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole B-AS
? O

Very O
immature O
bartender B-AS
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service B-AS
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses B-AS
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
eater O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B-AS
to O
go O
to O
. O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
'm O
eating O
indian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

over O
. O

The O
location B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place B-AS

This O
place O
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi B-AS
. O

Trust O
me O
. O

The O
dosas B-AS
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
rich O
pastas B-AS
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B-AS
. O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off O
- O
set O
by O
the O
pour O
- O
your O
- O
own O
measures B-AS
of I-AS
liquers I-AS
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O
... O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off- O
night O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-AS
lasagna I-AS
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
bread I-AS
pudding I-AS
for O
dessert O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
