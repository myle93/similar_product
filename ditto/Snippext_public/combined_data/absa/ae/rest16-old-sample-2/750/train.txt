I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-AS
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

It O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
was O
incredible O
last O
night O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B-AS
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
must O
visit O
! O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great O
! O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

While O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland B-AS
Brewery I-AS
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

The O
takeout B-AS
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

$ O
170 O
down O
the O
toilet O
... O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food O
art O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary O
, O
birthday O
, O
valentines O
day O
... O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
great O
staff B-AS
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
egg B-AS
custards I-AS
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O
and O
helpful O
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami- O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste- O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

The O
baked B-AS
clams I-AS
octopus I-AS
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-AS
with O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
casual O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

The O
lamb B-AS
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
divine O
! O
! O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

Very O
pleased O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` B-AS

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O

in O
NY O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O

if O
you O

prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O

its O
the O
best O

Not O

is O
the O

the O
best O
around O
, O
the O

has O
always O
been O
attentive O

the O
Hudson O

of O

. O

whoever O
the O
jazz B-AS
duo I-AS
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O

with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O

great O
food B-AS

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

Gross O
food B-AS
– O
Wow O
- O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-AS
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

My O
fav O
was O
the O
sassy B-AS
lassi I-AS
... O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-AS

Go O
to O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-AS
Hand I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

you O
should O
travel O
from O
the O
Bronx O
to O
try O
it O
... O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-AS
room I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-AS
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-AS
Pomodori I-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
to O
everyone O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

There O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
but- O
worth- O
it O
'' O
and O
there O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
and- O
WTF O
'' O
? O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
there O
's O
hookah B-AS
. O

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world- O
beater O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-AS
. O

Thank O
you O
everyone O
at O
Water B-AS
's I-AS
Edge I-AS
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

( O
The O
asparagus B-AS
, I-AS
truffle I-AS
oil I-AS
, I-AS
parmesan I-AS
bruschetta I-AS
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

the O
salads B-AS
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-AS
! O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

Nice O
view B-AS
of I-AS
river I-AS
and I-AS
NYC I-AS
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-AS
. O

The O
lunch B-AS
buffet I-AS
is O
expensive O
but O
is O
deff O
worth O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

This O
dish B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

You O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non B-AS
- I-AS
veg I-AS
selections I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
amazing O
service B-AS
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
class O
act O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

This O
place O
was O
reccomended O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

Come O
on O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

Planet B-AS
Thailand I-AS
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

peppers O
, O
onions O
, O
relish O
, O
chilli O
, O

, O
you O
NAME O
it O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-AS
. O

Love O
the O
scene B-AS
first O
off O
- O
the O
place B-AS
has O
a O
character O
and O
nice O
light O
to O
it..very O
fortunate O
, O
location B-AS
wise O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Their O
tuna B-AS
tartar I-AS
appetizer I-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Raymond B-AS
the O
bartender O
rocks O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY- O
- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

Great O
service B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

I O
came O
across O
Village B-AS
Underground I-AS
by O
accident O
, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-AS
of I-AS
gari I-AS
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

The O
Steak B-AS
Tartare I-AS
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

i O
love O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
– O
i O
looove O
east B-AS
village I-AS
pizza I-AS

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
... O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

And O
$ O
11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole B-AS
? O

Very O
immature O
bartender B-AS
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service B-AS
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses B-AS
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
eater O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B-AS
to O
go O
to O
. O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
'm O
eating O
indian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

over O
. O

The O
location B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place B-AS

This O
place O
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi B-AS
. O

Trust O
me O
. O

The O
dosas B-AS
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
rich O
pastas B-AS
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B-AS
. O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off O
- O
set O
by O
the O
pour O
- O
your O
- O
own O
measures B-AS
of I-AS
liquers I-AS
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O
... O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off- O
night O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-AS
lasagna I-AS
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
bread I-AS
pudding I-AS
for O
dessert O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B-AS
was O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

I O
'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-AS
. O

A O
great O
place B-AS
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks O
... O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

overpriced O
japanese B-AS
food I-AS
with O
mediocre O
service B-AS

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

Go O
there O
once O
and O
oh O
yes O
... O
you O
will O
go O
back O
... O
you O
will O
... O

We O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-AS
. O

But O
the O
best O
pork B-AS
souvlaki I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-AS
croquette I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-AS
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-AS
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

however O
, O
it O
's O
the O
service B-AS
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-AS
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

Pizza B-AS
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

Taxan B-AS
delicious O
! O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
restaurant I-AS
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

A O
beautifully O
designed O
dreamy O
Egyptian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
that O
gets O
sceney O
at O
night O
. O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-AS
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-AS
$ I-AS
29 I-AS
fixe I-AS
prix I-AS
menu I-AS
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

Good O
spreads B-AS
, O
great O
beverage B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
bagels B-AS
really O
tasty O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

I O
think O
I O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one O
- O
two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
flavorful O
, O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/ O
2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B-AS
ever O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

skip O
dessert B-AS
. O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel O
place O
. O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
... O
but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-AS
tacos I-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
- O
- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-AS
and O
nice O
service B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth B-AS
's I-AS
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O
! O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

good O
music B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
, O
speedy O
service B-AS
affordable O
prices O
. O

We O
had O
half B-AS
/ I-AS
half I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
mine O
was O
eggplant O
and O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O
and O
it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

I O
've O
enjoyed O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
we O
've O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too O
- O
authentic O
- O
for O
- O
me O
dish B-AS
( O
I O
'm O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring O
) O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-AS

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
.but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

Ravioli B-AS
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

Drinks O
: O
2 O
glasses O
of O
Dom O
Perignon O
at O
$ O
35 O
each O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

An O
excellent O
service B-AS

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

Their O
bagels B-AS
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

Restaurant O

the O
the O

an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O

a O

paid O
an O
extra O

2 O
for O
the O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O

they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
take O
out O

? O

Great O
place B-AS
, O
great O
value O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O

Best O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NY O
! O

While O
their O
kitchen B-AS
food I-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-AS
! O
.. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
`` O
can O
I O
help O
you O
'' O
and O
`` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
'' O

But O
they O
do O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

This O
place B-AS
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-AS
bottles I-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

Will O
comeback O
for O
sure O
, O
wish O
they O
have O
it O
here O
in O
LA.. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-AS
style I-AS
Fried I-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Delivery B-AS
can O
be O
spot O
on O
or O
lacking O
depending O
on O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
day O
of O
the O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-AS
Jamun I-AS
( I-AS
dessert I-AS
) I-AS
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

Good O
drink B-AS
. O

Decent O
wine B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-AS
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B-AS
or I-AS
orange I-AS
flavoring I-AS
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-AS
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
- O
- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-AS
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-AS
and I-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

I O
love O
it O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O

dessert B-AS
would O
be O
better O
, O
Wrong O
! O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O

We O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O

for O
more O
than O
an O

The O

Great O

Gigondas B-AS

the O

a O
great O
value O

: O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O

absolutely O
nothing O

locations O
. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6:20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B-AS
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
atmosphere I-AS
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

The O
appetizers B-AS
are O
also O
delicious O
! O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B-AS
. O

the O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
scary O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

It O
's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

you O
know O
what O
i O
mean O
all O
the O
positives O
things O
happening O
there O
made O
mw O
write O
this O
review O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-AS
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow B-AS
Ley I-AS
Soh I-AS
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L.A O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place B-AS
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
. O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre- O
theater O
menu O
( O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
) O
. O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
Bukhara O
often O
as O
she O
lives O
near O
it O
. O

Great O
, O
original O
taste O
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B-AS
. O

Love O

La I-AS

This O
place B-AS
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ai O
n't O
bad O
. O

LOL O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-AS
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B-AS
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
and O
the O
rose B-AS
special I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

if O
you O
're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-AS
vinegar I-AS
over I-AS
icecream I-AS
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
! O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

Just O
make O
sure O
my O
ice O
water O
is O
kept O
full O
and O
my O
tea O
kettle O
filled O
with O
piping O
hot O
tea O
and O
that O
's O
all O
the O
service O
I O
need O
... O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations O
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

There O
's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
sushi I-AS
can O
not O
be O
beaten O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-AS
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatos I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O
! O

Have O
the O
iced B-AS
tea I-AS
. O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B-AS
! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

Always O
great O
service B-AS
! O

I O
love O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
personally O
was O
n't O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
portobello B-AS
and I-AS
asparagus I-AS
mole I-AS
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-AS
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B-AS
very O
much O
... O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

Fresh O
, O
mind O
blowing O
flavors O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-AS
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-AS
shrimp I-AS
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
and I-AS
roe I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-AS
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
must O
! O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-AS
with O
a O
smile O
. O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-AS
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

Faan B-AS
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B-AS
with I-AS
Scallops I-AS
and I-AS
Shrimp I-AS
is O
great O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

those O
rolls B-AS
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-AS
was O
n't O
fresh O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-AS
breast I-AS
special I-AS
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

I O
've O
also O
been O
amazed O
at O
all O
the O
new O
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
: O
A O
new O
Jazz B-AS
Bar I-AS
, O
the O
most O
fantastic O
Dining B-AS
Garden I-AS
, O
the O
Best O
Thin B-AS
Crust I-AS
Pizzas I-AS
, O
and O
now O
a O
Lasagna B-AS
Menu I-AS
which O
is O
to O
die O
for O
( O
these O
are O
not O
your O
average O
lasagnas O
) O
! O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

The O
have O
a O
great O
cocktail B-AS
with I-AS
Citrus I-AS
Vodka I-AS
and I-AS
lemon I-AS
and I-AS
lime I-AS
juice I-AS
and I-AS
mint I-AS
leaves I-AS
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

I O
'll O
being O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
positives O
: O
cool O
decor B-AS
, O
good O
pita B-AS
and O
hummus B-AS
, O
and O
grilled B-AS
octopus I-AS
that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-AS
from O
the O
dumpling O
menu O
. O

Salads B-AS
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-AS
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-AS
restaurant I-AS
! O

the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
... O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
too O
. O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O
b O
/ O
c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup O
) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips O
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
) O
, O
the O
vinegar O
- O
soaked O
rice B-AS
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you O
're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

well O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza O
here O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid- O
town O
. O

Food B-AS
- O
awesome O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

They O
have O
great O
rolls B-AS
, O
the O
triple B-AS
color I-AS
and I-AS
norwegetan I-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
are O
awesome O
and O
filling O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O

I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-AS

crab B-AS

( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

The O
food B-AS
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O

had O
her O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O

being O
trapped O
in O
a O

waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O

The O

The O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O

tried O
Pick O
a O

on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Sushi B-AS
experience O
was O
unbelievable O
with O
my O
fiance O

The O
food B-AS
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O

Great O
Atmosphere B-AS

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-AS
, O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-AS
is O
fast O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-AS
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O

pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
exotic B-AS
food I-AS
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O

are O
there O

- O
to O
know O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O

bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-AS
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

The O
Seafood B-AS
Dynamite I-AS
is O
also O
otherworldly O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O

not O
what O
I O
would O

out O

Great O
bagels B-AS

out I-AS

The B-AS

has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O

City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
`` O
I O
've O
been O
to O
the O

I O
had O
my O

'give O
it O
a O

I O
will O
be O

differently O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
nakgi B-AS
- I-AS
bokum I-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B-AS
, O
beef B-AS
, O
and O
lamb B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

The O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

You O
are O
not O
eating O
haut O
cuisine O
with O
subtle O
hints O
of O
whatever O
but O
: O
Cassuolet O
, O
Steake O
Fritte O
, O
Tripe O
Stew O
, O
etc O
; O
simple O
stuff O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
great O
too O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
lie O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
- O
- O
the O
food B-AS
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

Downstairs B-AS
lounge I-AS
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant B-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O
pastas B-AS
! O

What O
's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-AS
England I-AS
Chowder I-AS
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Great O
vibe B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
the O
place B-AS
is O
pretty O
tiny O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
prices O
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-AS
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B-AS
pasta I-AS
cant O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

Excellent O
spot B-AS
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co O
- O
workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
have O
n't O
seen O
in O
a O
while O
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

noodles B-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
and I-AS
coconut I-AS
juice I-AS
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Never O
again O
! O

The O
duck B-AS
confit I-AS
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
terrine I-AS
with I-AS
figs I-AS
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
food B-AS
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

The O
anti B-AS
- I-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B-AS
mains I-AS
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-AS
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
Pub I-AS
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-AS
. O

enough O
said O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor B-AS
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

Leon B-AS
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
: O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French B-AS
bistro I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
good O
specials B-AS
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B-AS

Consistently O
good O
Japanese B-AS
Tapas I-AS
. O

Run O
do O
n't O
walk O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-AS
. O

We O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O
.. O

A O
gentleman B-AS
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

This O
is O
a O
twenty- O
something O
guy O
that O
does O
n't O
mind O
laying O
down O
$ O
300 O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal O
for O
2 O
on O
special O
occassions O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-AS
dancing I-AS
show I-AS
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

Best O
. O
Sushi B-AS
. O
Ever O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

They O
're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot O
, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O

, O
it O
was O
very O
well O
organized O
. O

It O
's O
all O
about O
the O
food B-AS
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

The O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B-AS
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

It O
is O
so O
romantic O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
excellent O

was O
great O
, O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

Excellent O

. O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O

Guaranteed O
to O
be O

tasty O
experience O
! O
) O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

Not O
because O
you O
are O
`` O
The B-AS
Four I-AS

`` O
... O
– O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O

The O

of O

of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O

. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
