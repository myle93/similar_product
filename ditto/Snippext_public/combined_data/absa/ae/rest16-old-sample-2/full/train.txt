I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-AS
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

It O
's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
was O
incredible O
last O
night O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B-AS
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
must O
visit O
! O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great O
! O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

While O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland B-AS
Brewery I-AS
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
BEEN O
DISAPPOINTED O
! O

The O
takeout B-AS
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

$ O
170 O
down O
the O
toilet O
... O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-AS
and O
terrific O
food B-AS
. O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-AS
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food O
art O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
take O
out O
- O
of O
- O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary O
, O
birthday O
, O
valentines O
day O
... O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
great O
staff B-AS
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
- O
intrusive O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
egg B-AS
custards I-AS
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O
and O
helpful O
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami- O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste- O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

The O
baked B-AS
clams I-AS
octopus I-AS
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-AS
with O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent O
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
casual O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

The O
lamb B-AS
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
divine O
! O
! O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

Very O
pleased O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` B-AS

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun O

in O
NY O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O

if O
you O

prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O

its O
the O
best O

Not O

is O
the O

the O
best O
around O
, O
the O

has O
always O
been O
attentive O

the O
Hudson O

of O

. O

whoever O
the O
jazz B-AS
duo I-AS
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O

with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O

great O
food B-AS

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

Gross O
food B-AS
– O
Wow O
- O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-AS
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

My O
fav O
was O
the O
sassy B-AS
lassi I-AS
... O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-AS

Go O
to O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-AS
Hand I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

you O
should O
travel O
from O
the O
Bronx O
to O
try O
it O
... O

Highly O
recommended O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-AS
room I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-AS
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-AS
Pomodori I-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
to O
everyone O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

There O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
but- O
worth- O
it O
'' O
and O
there O
is O
`` O
Expensive- O
and- O
WTF O
'' O
? O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
there O
's O
hookah B-AS
. O

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world- O
beater O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-AS
. O

Thank O
you O
everyone O
at O
Water B-AS
's I-AS
Edge I-AS
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

( O
The O
asparagus B-AS
, I-AS
truffle I-AS
oil I-AS
, I-AS
parmesan I-AS
bruschetta I-AS
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

Need O
I O
say O
more O
? O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy O
. O

the O
salads B-AS
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-AS
! O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

Kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

Nice O
view B-AS
of I-AS
river I-AS
and I-AS
NYC I-AS
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-AS
. O

The O
lunch B-AS
buffet I-AS
is O
expensive O
but O
is O
deff O
worth O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

This O
dish B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

You O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non B-AS
- I-AS
veg I-AS
selections I-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-AS
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
amazing O
service B-AS
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
class O
act O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

This O
place O
was O
reccomended O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

Come O
on O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

Planet B-AS
Thailand I-AS
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

peppers O
, O
onions O
, O
relish O
, O
chilli O
, O

, O
you O
NAME O
it O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-AS
. O

Love O
the O
scene B-AS
first O
off O
- O
the O
place B-AS
has O
a O
character O
and O
nice O
light O
to O
it..very O
fortunate O
, O
location B-AS
wise O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Their O
tuna B-AS
tartar I-AS
appetizer I-AS
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Raymond B-AS
the O
bartender O
rocks O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
. O

highly O
recommended O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY- O
- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

Great O
service B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5 O
- O
8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

I O
came O
across O
Village B-AS
Underground I-AS
by O
accident O
, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-AS
of I-AS
gari I-AS
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

The O
Steak B-AS
Tartare I-AS
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

i O
love O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
– O
i O
looove O
east B-AS
village I-AS
pizza I-AS

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
... O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
- O
in O
- O
your O
- O
mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

And O
$ O
11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole B-AS
? O

Very O
immature O
bartender B-AS
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service B-AS
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses B-AS
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
eater O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B-AS
to O
go O
to O
. O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
'm O
eating O
indian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

over O
. O

The O
location B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place B-AS

This O
place O
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi B-AS
. O

Trust O
me O
. O

The O
dosas B-AS
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
, O
rich O
pastas B-AS
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B-AS
. O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off O
- O
set O
by O
the O
pour O
- O
your O
- O
own O
measures B-AS
of I-AS
liquers I-AS
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O
... O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off- O
night O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-AS
lasagna I-AS
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
bread I-AS
pudding I-AS
for O
dessert O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B-AS
was O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

I O
'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-AS
. O

A O
great O
place B-AS
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks O
... O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

overpriced O
japanese B-AS
food I-AS
with O
mediocre O
service B-AS

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

Go O
there O
once O
and O
oh O
yes O
... O
you O
will O
go O
back O
... O
you O
will O
... O

We O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-AS
. O

But O
the O
best O
pork B-AS
souvlaki I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-AS
croquette I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-AS
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-AS
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

however O
, O
it O
's O
the O
service B-AS
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-AS
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

Pizza B-AS
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

Taxan B-AS
delicious O
! O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
restaurant I-AS
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

A O
beautifully O
designed O
dreamy O
Egyptian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
that O
gets O
sceney O
at O
night O
. O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-AS
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-AS
$ I-AS
29 I-AS
fixe I-AS
prix I-AS
menu I-AS
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

Good O
spreads B-AS
, O
great O
beverage B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
bagels B-AS
really O
tasty O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

I O
think O
I O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one O
- O
two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
flavorful O
, O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/ O
2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-AS
. O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B-AS
ever O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

skip O
dessert B-AS
. O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel O
place O
. O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
... O
but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-AS
tacos I-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
- O
- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-AS
and O
nice O
service B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-AS
is O
amazing O
! O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth B-AS
's I-AS
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place O
! O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

good O
music B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
, O
speedy O
service B-AS
affordable O
prices O
. O

We O
had O
half B-AS
/ I-AS
half I-AS
pizza I-AS
, O
mine O
was O
eggplant O
and O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O
and O
it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

I O
've O
enjoyed O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
we O
've O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too O
- O
authentic O
- O
for O
- O
me O
dish B-AS
( O
I O
'm O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring O
) O
. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-AS

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
.but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

Ravioli B-AS
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

Drinks O
: O
2 O
glasses O
of O
Dom O
Perignon O
at O
$ O
35 O
each O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

An O
excellent O
service B-AS

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

Their O
bagels B-AS
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

Restaurant O

the O
the O

an O
excellent O
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O

a O

paid O
an O
extra O

2 O
for O
the O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O

they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
take O
out O

? O

Great O
place B-AS
, O
great O
value O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O

Best O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NY O
! O

While O
their O
kitchen B-AS
food I-AS
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-AS
! O
.. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
`` O
can O
I O
help O
you O
'' O
and O
`` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
'' O

But O
they O
do O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

This O
place B-AS
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-AS
bottles I-AS
of I-AS
water I-AS
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

Will O
comeback O
for O
sure O
, O
wish O
they O
have O
it O
here O
in O
LA.. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-AS
style I-AS
Fried I-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Delivery B-AS
can O
be O
spot O
on O
or O
lacking O
depending O
on O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
day O
of O
the O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-AS
Jamun I-AS
( I-AS
dessert I-AS
) I-AS
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

Good O
drink B-AS
. O

Decent O
wine B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-AS
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B-AS
or I-AS
orange I-AS
flavoring I-AS
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-AS
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
- O
- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-AS
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-AS
and I-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

I O
love O
it O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O

dessert B-AS
would O
be O
better O
, O
Wrong O
! O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O

We O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O

for O
more O
than O
an O

The O

Great O

Gigondas B-AS

the O

a O
great O
value O

: O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O

absolutely O
nothing O

locations O
. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6:20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B-AS
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
atmosphere I-AS
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

The O
appetizers B-AS
are O
also O
delicious O
! O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B-AS
. O

the O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
scary O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

It O
's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

you O
know O
what O
i O
mean O
all O
the O
positives O
things O
happening O
there O
made O
mw O
write O
this O
review O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-AS
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow B-AS
Ley I-AS
Soh I-AS
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk- O
up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L.A O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place B-AS
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York O
. O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre- O
theater O
menu O
( O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
) O
. O

My O
GF O
and O
I O
dine O
at O
Bukhara O
often O
as O
she O
lives O
near O
it O
. O

Great O
, O
original O
taste O
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B-AS
. O

Love O

La I-AS

This O
place B-AS
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ai O
n't O
bad O
. O

LOL O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-AS
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B-AS
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
and O
the O
rose B-AS
special I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

if O
you O
're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-AS
vinegar I-AS
over I-AS
icecream I-AS
, O
it O
's O
wonderful O
! O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

Just O
make O
sure O
my O
ice O
water O
is O
kept O
full O
and O
my O
tea O
kettle O
filled O
with O
piping O
hot O
tea O
and O
that O
's O
all O
the O
service O
I O
need O
... O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations O
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

There O
's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
sushi I-AS
can O
not O
be O
beaten O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-AS
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatos I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O
! O

Have O
the O
iced B-AS
tea I-AS
. O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B-AS
! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

Always O
great O
service B-AS
! O

I O
love O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
personally O
was O
n't O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
portobello B-AS
and I-AS
asparagus I-AS
mole I-AS
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-AS
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B-AS
very O
much O
... O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

Fresh O
, O
mind O
blowing O
flavors O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-AS
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-AS
shrimp I-AS
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
and I-AS
roe I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-AS
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
must O
! O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-AS
with O
a O
smile O
. O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-AS
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

Faan B-AS
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B-AS
with I-AS
Scallops I-AS
and I-AS
Shrimp I-AS
is O
great O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high O
- O
end O
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O
's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

those O
rolls B-AS
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-AS
was O
n't O
fresh O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-AS
breast I-AS
special I-AS
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

I O
've O
also O
been O
amazed O
at O
all O
the O
new O
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
: O
A O
new O
Jazz B-AS
Bar I-AS
, O
the O
most O
fantastic O
Dining B-AS
Garden I-AS
, O
the O
Best O
Thin B-AS
Crust I-AS
Pizzas I-AS
, O
and O
now O
a O
Lasagna B-AS
Menu I-AS
which O
is O
to O
die O
for O
( O
these O
are O
not O
your O
average O
lasagnas O
) O
! O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free O
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good O
too O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

The O
have O
a O
great O
cocktail B-AS
with I-AS
Citrus I-AS
Vodka I-AS
and I-AS
lemon I-AS
and I-AS
lime I-AS
juice I-AS
and I-AS
mint I-AS
leaves I-AS
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly O
, O
no O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

I O
'll O
being O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
positives O
: O
cool O
decor B-AS
, O
good O
pita B-AS
and O
hummus B-AS
, O
and O
grilled B-AS
octopus I-AS
that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-AS
from O
the O
dumpling O
menu O
. O

Salads B-AS
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-AS
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-AS
restaurant I-AS
! O

the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
... O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
too O
. O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O
b O
/ O
c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup O
) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips O
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
) O
, O
the O
vinegar O
- O
soaked O
rice B-AS
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you O
're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

well O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza O
here O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid- O
town O
. O

Food B-AS
- O
awesome O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un O
- O
appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

They O
have O
great O
rolls B-AS
, O
the O
triple B-AS
color I-AS
and I-AS
norwegetan I-AS
rolls I-AS
, O
are O
awesome O
and O
filling O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O

I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-AS

crab B-AS

( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

The O
food B-AS
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O

had O
her O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O

being O
trapped O
in O
a O

waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O

The O

The O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O

tried O
Pick O
a O

on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Sushi B-AS
experience O
was O
unbelievable O
with O
my O
fiance O

The O
food B-AS
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O

Great O
Atmosphere B-AS

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-AS
, O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-AS
is O
fast O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-AS
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O

pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
exotic B-AS
food I-AS
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O

are O
there O

- O
to O
know O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O

bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-AS
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

The O
Seafood B-AS
Dynamite I-AS
is O
also O
otherworldly O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good O

not O
what O
I O
would O

out O

Great O
bagels B-AS

out I-AS

The B-AS

has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O

City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
`` O
I O
've O
been O
to O
the O

I O
had O
my O

'give O
it O
a O

I O
will O
be O

does O
fill O
up O

the O
evening O

The O
nakgi B-AS

bokum I-AS
was O
horrible O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B-AS
, O
beef B-AS
, O
and O
lamb B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

The O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

You O
are O
not O
eating O
haut O

of O
whatever O
but O
: O
Cassuolet O
, O
Steake O
Fritte O
, O
Tripe O
Stew O

etc O
; O
simple O
stuff O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
great O
too O
! O

The O
food B-AS

, O
I O

time O
for O
me O
! O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
- O
- O
the O
food B-AS
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

Downstairs B-AS

is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant B-AS

What O
's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-AS
England I-AS
Chowder I-AS
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
. O

It O
's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Great O
vibe B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
the O
place B-AS
is O
pretty O
tiny O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
prices O
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-AS
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B-AS
pasta I-AS
cant O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

Excellent O
spot B-AS
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co O
- O
workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
have O
n't O
seen O
in O
a O
while O
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

noodles B-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
and I-AS
coconut I-AS
juice I-AS
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Never O
again O
! O

The O
duck B-AS
confit I-AS
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
terrine I-AS
with I-AS
figs I-AS
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
food B-AS
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

The O
anti B-AS
- I-AS
pasta I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B-AS
mains I-AS
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-AS
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
Pub I-AS
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-AS
. O

enough O
said O
! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor B-AS
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

Leon B-AS

Run O
do O
n't O
walk O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-AS
. O

We O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O
.. O

A O
gentleman B-AS
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

This O
is O
a O
twenty- O
something O
guy O
that O
does O
n't O
mind O
laying O
down O
$ O
300 O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal O
for O
2 O
on O
special O
occassions O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-AS
dancing I-AS
show I-AS
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

Best O
. O
Sushi B-AS
. O
Ever O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

They O
're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot O
, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O
here O
, O
it O
was O
very O
well O
organized O
. O

It O
's O
all O
about O
the O
food B-AS
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

The O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B-AS
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

It O
is O
so O
romantic O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
excellent O

Service B-AS
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic O
. O

Excellent O

more O
reasonably O

Guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O
experience O
! O
) O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

Not O
because O
you O
are O

you O
are O
allowed O

The O

of O

of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O

it O
's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B-AS

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O

Each O

( O
not O
the O

- O
they O
're O
fantastic O

but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O

seat O
you O
) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-AS
dishes I-AS
I O
would O
never O
return O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
. O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O

2 O
times O
of O
then O
! O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-AS
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O

Its O
dark O

there O
is O
always O
jazz O

playing O
when O
we O
go O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-AS
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O

The O

and O
the O
fastest O

You O

FANTASTIC O

The O

looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O

have O
ever O
tried O

Rao O

The O

diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B-AS
of I-AS
herbs I-AS
and I-AS

. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
. O

We O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O
home O
with O
us O
. O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

the O
bestt O

The O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
very O
dissappointed O
. O

please O
do O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

Dessert B-AS
: O
pure O
disaster O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
offers O
impeccable O
service O
. O

A O
beef O
Consomme O

Staff B-AS
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

Loved O
it O

The O
food B-AS
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
are O
appropriate O
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

The O
price O
very O
reasonable O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

Well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
ca O
n't O
hide O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O

Go O

Ambiance B-AS
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

Waitstaff B-AS
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-AS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place B-AS
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good O
response O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

The O
sushi B-AS
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

However O
, O
our O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

amazing O
fresh O
dogs B-AS
but O
best O
of O
all O
endless O
toppings B-AS
! O
! O
! O

Remind O
me O
of O
home O
. O

esp O
. O
during O
happy O
hour O
! O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentive O
( O
thanks O
to O
the O
service B-AS
button I-AS
on O
your O
table O
) O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
order O
. O

I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
. O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-AS
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B-AS
is O
great O
: O
it O
's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-AS
, O
though O
: O
) O

Great O
atmoshere B-AS
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
were O
juicy O
and O
tender O
inside O
and O
had O
plenty O
of O
crunch O
and O
snap O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
had O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
it O
has O
2 O
oz O
. O
of O
Maine O
Lobster O
in O
it O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Indo B-AS
Chinese I-AS
food I-AS
, O
pretty O
good O
... O

I O
got O
the O
$ B-AS
10 I-AS
10 I-AS
- I-AS
piece I-AS
dim I-AS
sum I-AS
combo I-AS
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
is O
fairly O
priced O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

I O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
`` O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
'' O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-AS
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
soon O
! O

Again O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
great O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B-AS
was O
n't O
so O
great O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B-AS
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
has O
great O
staff B-AS
. O

Love O
it O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

She O
replied O
`` O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O
'' O

Awesome O

Every O
time O
I O
have O
a O
special O
occasion O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
going O
anywhere O
else O
. O

The O
floor O
was O
wet O
, O
the O
trash O
can O
filled O
with O
hand O
towels O
n O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
, O
no O
soap O
, O
and O
no O
hand O
towels O
left O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds- O
- O
this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/ O
10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
beautiful O
place B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

While O
it O
's O
not O
Nobu O
, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

The O
farro B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
the O
mashed B-AS
yukon I-AS
potatoes I-AS
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

Try O
the O
sea B-AS
bass I-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

Great O
sushi B-AS
experience O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

Stay O
away O

This O
restaurant B-AS
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

Great O
pizza B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-AS
daiquiries I-AS
as O
well O
! O

Service B-AS
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

Lucky B-AS
Strike I-AS
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-AS
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-AS
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
) O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy O
's O
! O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

Service B-AS
was O
good O
and O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Pizza B-AS
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade B-AS
pasta I-AS
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-AS
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
... O
) O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-AS
sauce I-AS
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

The O
blond B-AS
wood I-AS
decor I-AS
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium B-AS
sake I-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B-AS
that O
were O
just O
right O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
great O
, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond B-AS
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B-AS
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O
- O
down O
. O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B-AS
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go O
- O
to O
for O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-AS
like O
this O
. O

Dessert B-AS
is O
a O
joke O
... O
dont O
bother O

Traditional B-AS
French I-AS
decour I-AS
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-AS
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-AS
tuna I-AS
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

Fantastic O
place B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it O
; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-AS
la I-AS
Femme I-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
it O
's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
Tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

Pizza B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

The O
pastas B-AS
are O
incredible O
, O
the O
risottos B-AS
( O
particularly O
the O
sepia B-AS
) O
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
braised B-AS
rabbit I-AS
is O
amazing O
. O

Zero O
ambiance B-AS
to O
boot O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-AS
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi- O
bokum O
. O

Chicken B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
had O
tomato O
or O
pimentos O
on O
top O
? O
? O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-AS
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
can O
’ O
t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B-AS
. O

My O
daughter O
's O
wedding O
reception O
at O
Water B-AS
's I-AS
Edge I-AS
received O
the O
highest O
compliments O
from O
our O
guests O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
the O
chef B-AS
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for O
... O

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
local O
... O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

And O
even O
with O
it O
's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Amazing O
! O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in O
- O
house O
( O
even O
the O
gyro B-AS
meat I-AS
and O
sausages B-AS
) O
, O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
ingredients B-AS
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected O
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
sat O
1/ O
26 O
and O
was O
disappointed O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-AS
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-AS
, O
chai B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chole B-AS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-AS
and O
dhal B-AS
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
! O

This O
place B-AS
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone O
. O

This O
place B-AS
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-AS
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
`` O
free O
'' O
appetizer B-AS
of I-AS
olives I-AS
was O
disappointing O
. O

great O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
.. O

I O
CAN O
EAT O
HERE O
EVERY O
DAY O
OF O
THE O
WEEK O
REALLY O
LOL O
LOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-AS
... O
) O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-AS
mozzarella I-AS
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria O
's O
. O

The O
Dancing B-AS
, I-AS
White I-AS
River I-AS
and I-AS
Millenium I-AS
rolls I-AS
are O
musts O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
Prime B-AS
Rib I-AS
it O
was O
good O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor O
. O

Poor O
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
... O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
! O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
delicious O
. O

Paul B-AS
, O
the O
maitre O
d O
' O
, O
was O
totally O
professional O
and O
always O
on O
top O
of O
things O
. O

Great O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
! O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-AS
more O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-AS
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-AS
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-AS
mix I-AS
( I-AS
special I-AS
) I-AS
, O
crab B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
assorted B-AS
sashimi I-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
and O
rolls B-AS
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-AS
, O
and O
the O
banana B-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

The O
omlette B-AS
for I-AS
brunch I-AS
is O
great O
... O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B-AS
( I-AS
Egg I-AS
) I-AS
rolls I-AS
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-AS
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
penne I-AS
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

Yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B-AS
is O
top O
notch O
... O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
wonderfull O
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona B-AS
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-AS
and O
bev B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao B-AS
's I-AS
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

Their O
pad B-AS
penang I-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive- O
aggressive O
torture O
. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint B-AS
. O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
. O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-AS
. O

it O
was O
really O
good O
pizza B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

This O
is O
the O
MOST O
wonderful O
restaurant B-AS
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O
, O
not O
just O
Brooklyn O
... O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside- O
out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
- O
to O
- O
perfection O
mussels B-AS
in I-AS
spicy I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

the O
all B-AS
- I-AS
u I-AS
- I-AS
can I-AS
- I-AS
eat I-AS
sushi I-AS
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

Whether O
it O
's O
the O
parmesean B-AS
porcini I-AS
souffle I-AS
or O
the O
lamb B-AS
glazed I-AS
with I-AS
balsamic I-AS
vinegar I-AS
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

The O
veal B-AS
and O
the O
mushrooms B-AS
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer B-AS
selection I-AS
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
HUGE O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
) O
for O
two O
people O
. O

Once O
you O
try O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
beware.. O
you O
ca O
n't O
stop O
! O

Food B-AS
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-AS
vegatables I-AS
in I-AS
side I-AS
orders I-AS
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

Place B-AS
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O
dress O
code O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

Myagi B-AS
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
City O
; O
the O
place O
the O
negative O
reviews O
describe O
sound O
like O
they O
were O
somewhere O
else O
. O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
NYC O
for O
bit O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene O
. O

We O
had O
Pam B-AS
's I-AS
special I-AS
fried I-AS
fish I-AS
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
; O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
staff B-AS
, O
mileau B-AS
. O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
Rocks O
. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

I O
'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-AS
. O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

The O
service B-AS
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-AS
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
hyde I-AS
Pub I-AS
last O
night O
. O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu B-AS
- I-AS
Shabu I-AS
. O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre- O
fix O
was O
$ O
29/ O
per O
person O
including O
sake O
but O
it O
is O
$ O
55 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
sake O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Suan B-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-AS
place I-AS
! O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-AS
cuisine I-AS
! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O
. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B-AS
. O

Ambience B-AS
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B-AS
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O
. O

Awsome O
Pizza B-AS
especially O
the O
Margheritta B-AS
slice I-AS
. O

delicious O
bagels B-AS
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

What O
? O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
! O

The O
counter B-AS
service I-AS
is O
bad O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-AS
. O

One O
special B-AS
roll I-AS
and O
one O
regular B-AS
roll I-AS
is O
enough O
to O
fill O
you O
up O
, O
but O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B-AS
! O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

Rao B-AS
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing O
special O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
all O
shared O
so O
we O
get O
to O
order O
together O
and O
eat O
together O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-AS
and O
great O
service B-AS
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over O
- O
priced O
. O

Excellent O
food B-AS
for O
great O
prices O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good O
. O


Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-AS
booths I-AS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
( O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-AS
ceilings I-AS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
) O
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Gorgeous O
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

Toons B-AS
has O
recently O
been O
redone O
, O
so O
it O
's O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O

24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

Molto O
bene O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing O
... O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef B-AS

tasting I-AS

and O
your O
favourite O

or O

I O
complete O
the O
total O

by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white B-AS

included O
a O
four B-AS

prix I-AS

menu I-AS
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O

adn O
their O

! O

wont O
come O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

Unbelievable O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-AS
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-AS
wooden I-AS
doors I-AS
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor B-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
place B-AS
is O
not O
beautiful O
, O
the O
food B-AS
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

The O
place B-AS
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O
. O

But O
who O
says O
Murray O
's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-AS
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
you O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian B-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

Ingredients B-AS
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

Subtle O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-AS
and I-AS
Hydes I-AS
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
wonderful O
; O

People B-AS
are O
always O
friendly O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O
! O

( O
i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood.. O
) O

The O
cold B-AS
appetizer I-AS
dishes I-AS
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

I O
love O
Ess- O
a- O
bagel O
, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
; O
- O
) O

The O
place B-AS
is O
beautiful O
! O

the O
drinks B-AS
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8pm O
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

The O
DJ B-AS
is O
awesome O
, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
keep O
going O
back O
. O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you O
're O
ordering O
in O
- O
- O
the O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
can O
not O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
. O

Will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Beef B-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
is O
good O
as O
well O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

The O
food B-AS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-AS
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B-AS
Scallop I-AS
roll I-AS
.. O
. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
drinks B-AS
were O
were O
horrible O
! O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place B-AS
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit O
- O
in O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
my O
name O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

The O
mussels B-AS
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-AS
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

Fish B-AS
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O
Street O
, O
of O
course O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-AS
fair I-AS
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
's O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-AS
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

No O
thanks O
! O
! O
! O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband O
. O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

Great O
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Bukhara B-AS
Grill I-AS
, O
the O
tagline O
says O
it O
all.. O
`` O
INDIAN O
SPICE O
RAVE O
'' O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-AS
and O
great O
food B-AS
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

They O
have O
a O
delicious O
banana B-AS
chocolate I-AS
dessert I-AS
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
great O
green B-AS
tea I-AS
tempura I-AS
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
! O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
great O
decor B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

The O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
are O
GREAT O
! O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-AS
I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
your O
time O
and O
go O
somewhere O
else O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

Delicious O
, O
creative O
and O
fun O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-AS
and O
fantastic O
service B-AS
. O

Thalia B-AS
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-AS
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
does O
n't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

We O
've O
found O
it O
to O
be O
better O
and O
fresher O
than O
Kiku O
which O
is O
comparable O
in O
price O
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty O
! O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-AS
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-AS
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-AS
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

for O
7 O
years O
they O
have O
put O
out O
the O
most O
tasty O
, O
most O
delicious O
food B-AS
and O
kept O
it O
that O
way O
... O

Delivery B-AS
guy I-AS
sometimes O
get O
upset O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
tip O
more O
than O
10 O
% O
. O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B-AS
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

The O
quantity O
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

They O
're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

AMAZING O
MY O
FAVORITE O
! O
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-AS

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B-AS
House I-AS
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
's O
always O
good O
. O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B-AS
in O
the O
City O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

Rude O
service B-AS
, O
medicore O
food B-AS
... O
there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY O
... O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
one O

great O
toppings B-AS
definitely O
a O
place B-AS
you O
need O
to O
check O
out O
for O
late O
night O
munchies O
or O
a O
mid O
day O
boost O
! O

Good O
Experience O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-AS
was O
awsome O

Godfather O
) O

. O

a O
great O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

As O

student O
in O
NYU O

need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O

Great O
sake B-AS
! O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

Overall O
, O
decent O
food B-AS
at O
a O
good O
price O
, O
with O
friendly O
people B-AS
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
your O
money O
. O

It O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

The O
signs B-AS
, O
the O
specials B-AS
menus I-AS
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B-AS
casserole I-AS
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken O
, O
all O
dark O
meat O
and O
on O
the O
bone O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

Hands O
down O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
on O
the O
planet O
. O

THE O
BIG O
COMPLAINT O
: O
NO O
TOASTING O
AVAILABLE O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff B-AS
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
cheap O
eats B-AS
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
was O
awful O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-AS
special I-AS
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-AS
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
top O
- O
notch O
. O

Chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-AS
spot I-AS
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good O
. O

I O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-AS
( I-AS
rice I-AS
porridge I-AS
) I-AS
. O

Same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O.G O
. O
again O
last O
night O
. O

Do O
n't O
miss O
Bloom B-AS
's I-AS
on O
your O
next O
trip O
to O
Manhatten O
. O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Their O
sake B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-AS
and O
the O
name O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-AS
. O

Great O
survice B-AS

But O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

Good O
food B-AS
: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood B-AS
spaghetti I-AS
. O

so O
delicious O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-AS
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

I O
was O
visiting O
New O
York O
City O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
discovered O
this O
really O
warm O
and O
inviting O
restaurant B-AS
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

Inexpensive O
, O
unassuming O
, O
great O
time O
! O

No O
, O
really O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
've O
had O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-AS
torte I-AS
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-AS
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

Why O
? O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-AS
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
, O
service B-AS
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir B-AS
- I-AS
fried I-AS
squid I-AS
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-AS
amuse I-AS
bouche I-AS
. O

I O
've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O
! O
! O
! O
! O

An O
awesome O
organic O
dog B-AS
, O
and O
a O
conscious O
eco O
friendly O
establishment B-AS
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-AS
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
high O
prices O
you O
're O
going O
to O
pay O
is O
for O
the O
view B-AS
not O
for O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
sake B-AS
’ I-AS
s I-AS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
. O

Calling O
the O
place B-AS
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-AS
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-AS
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-AS
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

The O
crust B-AS
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-AS
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor B-AS
, O
good O
service B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-AS
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait B-AS
- I-AS
staff I-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-AS
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there O
. O

Moving O
on O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B-AS
and O
bad O
service B-AS
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
good B-AS
and O
bad O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

Wish O
NY O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places O
: O
intimate O
, O
superb O
food B-AS
, O
homey O
, O
top O
notch O
all O
the O
way O
around O
, O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

it O
's O
delicious O
! O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-AS
, O
you O
're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
- O
the O
- O
beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

The O
in B-AS
- I-AS
house I-AS
lady I-AS
DJ I-AS
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
takes O
requests O
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
. O

How O
this O
place B-AS
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

When O
you O
're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand O
- O
painted O
high O
ceiling B-AS
) O
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
menu I-AS
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

Fabulous O
decor B-AS
- O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
in O
a O
trendy O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
, O
very O
very O
good O
food B-AS
, O
cheaply O
- O
priced O
, O
generally O
friendly O
staff B-AS
, O
and O
if O
you O
're O
a O
Manhattanite O
, O
or O
spend O
most O
of O
your O
time O
in O
Manhattan O
, O
Rice B-AS
Avenue I-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
... O
..very O
Soho O
/ O
Village O
/ O
Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele O
... O
..all O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue O
! O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
too O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Loved O
It O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-AS
Go I-AS
Hamburgers I-AS
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
excellent O
! O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-AS
and O
has O
great O
food B-AS
! O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

Can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-AS
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

Expensive O

Though O
it O
's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I O
've O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-AS
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-AS
. O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-AS
table I-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host O
, O
Vittorio B-AS
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
- O
- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not O
- O
so O
- O
frequent O
visitor O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Too O
many O
other O
good O
places O
to O
have O
to O
settle O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
or O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

this O
place O
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings B-AS
and O
i O
mean O
all O
. O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS
and O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

oh O
speaking O
of O
bathroom O
, O
the O
mens B-AS
bathroom I-AS
was O
disgusting O
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date O
spot O
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B-AS
Ave I-AS
spot I-AS
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

This O
establishment B-AS
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

Love O
this O
place B-AS
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
we O
always O
go O
. O

Casa O
La O
Femme O

The O
vibe B-AS
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B-AS
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent O

THe O
perfect O
spot B-AS

The O

had O
a O
nice O
selection O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
margaritas B-AS

Food B-AS
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
new I-AS

city I-AS
skiline I-AS
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
Grill I-AS
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O

way O
better O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

Best O
meal B-AS
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

The O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
) O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-AS
terrace I-AS
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
ca O
n't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

Drinks B-AS
way O
over O
priced O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
... O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend O
's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

BEST O
DINING O
EXPERIENCE O
IN O
THE O
WEST O
VILLAGE O
! O

Food B-AS
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

But O
that O
was O
n't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-AS
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

Overall O
the O
food B-AS
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

NO O
PIZZA B-AS
33 I-AS
for O
me O
! O

Compared O
to O
Ess- O
a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

We O
have O
gone O
for O
dinner B-AS
only O
a O
few O
times O
but O
the O
same O
great O
quality O
and O
service B-AS
is O
given O
. O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

We O
were O
n't O
! O

Going O
to O
Bark B-AS
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy O
! O

Also O
, O
they O
do O
not O
take O
credit O
card O
so O
come O
with O
cash O
! O

Fantastic O
! O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B-AS
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

And O
I O
've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

Ask O
for O
Usha B-AS
, O
the O
nicest O
bartender O
in O
manhattan O
. O

Authentic O
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
that O
's O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
some O
of O
the O
'best O
' O
sushi O
joints O
in O
NYC O
( O
Nobu O
, O
Bond O
Street O
, O
JewelBako O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
Yamato O
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-AS
but O
was O
n't O
too O
impressed O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind- O
bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

The O
Cypriot B-AS
restaurant I-AS
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

I O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

I O
've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-AS
here O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

Service B-AS
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom B-AS
. O

The O
soup B-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
udon I-AS
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O
. O

Murray O
wo O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-AS
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
( O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma O
's O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

It O
's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

Cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

For O
a O
Fabulous O
Wedding O
! O

Regardless O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

its O
alright O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

Check O
this O
place B-AS
out O
! O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother O
's O
Day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre B-AS
d I-AS
' I-AS
was O
pretty O
rude O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
I O
'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
Tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

A O
classic O
! O

An O
unpretentious O
spot B-AS
in O
Park O
Slope O
, O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
consistently O
good O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
pleasant O
, O
effective O
and O
unassuming O
. O

Amazing O
food B-AS
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
incredible O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
pre O
- O
sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-AS
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-AS
and O
a O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
want O
a O
bottle O
of O
bubbly O
on O
a O
weekday O
so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles B-AS
of I-AS
Korbett I-AS
it O
was O
just O
enough O
. O

It O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-AS
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-AS
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O

( O
Always O
ask O
the O
bartender O
for O
the O
SEASONAL B-AS
beer I-AS
! O
! O
! O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-AS
! O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-AS
beer I-AS
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
decent O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-AS
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de- O
skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

Helpful O
service B-AS
and O
average O
price O
per O
dish B-AS
$ O
10 O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-AS
is O
even O
better O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-AS
tapas I-AS
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-AS
with O
great O
service B-AS
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B-AS
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Very O
, O
very O
nice O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

THe O
Pizza B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
were O
excellent O
- O
the O
service B-AS
too O
- O
- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-AS
dining I-AS
area I-AS
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-AS
Noir I-AS
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-AS
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

Spreads B-AS
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Old O
school O

There O
's O
another O

who O
I O
ca O
n't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
'' O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O

so O
her O

The O
best O
! O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
lollipop I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
( O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
) O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy O
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-AS
Chicken I-AS
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

Patsy B-AS
's I-AS
Pizza I-AS
= O
true O
love O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B-AS
sandwich I-AS
on I-AS
a I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

They O
all O
know O
you O
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
: O
you O
ca O
n't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre B-AS
- I-AS
D I-AS
's O
sense O
of O
`` O
table O
turnover O
'' O
, O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3 O
- O
6 O
each O
) O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

We O
had O
fun O
eating O
in O
there O
, O
we O
were O
there O
like O
around O
3 O
a.m. O
in O
the O
morning O
! O

THe O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
sitting I-AS
area I-AS
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

Reliable O
, O
Fresh O
Sushi B-AS

The O
shrimp B-AS
scampi I-AS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-AS
were O
plentiful O
. O

It O
just O
was O
n't O
Thai O
. O

A O
weakness O
is O
the O
chicken B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
salads I-AS
. O

Good O
Food B-AS

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O
! O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
design B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
just O
as O
good O
. O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza O
( O
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O
) O
. O

The O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-AS
! O
! O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O
. O

The O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

fine O
dining B-AS
restaurant O
quality O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
was O
special O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

Try O
green B-AS
curry I-AS
with I-AS
vegetables I-AS
. O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O
. O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-AS
. O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B-AS
, O
it O
's O
a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-AS
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

Big B-AS
Wong I-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
and O
fill O
your O
stomach O
. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-AS
Salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-AS
and I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
... O
.both O
very O
tasty O
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
views B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
city I-AS
were O
great O
. O

It O
's O
cuz O
it O
's O
so O
good O
you O
need O
to O
taste O
it O
! O
! O
! O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-AS
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-AS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

Nice O
for O
one O
time O
special O
occasion O
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

cirspy O
crust O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
egg B-AS
noodles I-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
beef I-AS
broth I-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
dumplings I-AS
and I-AS
slices I-AS
of I-AS
BBQ I-AS
roast I-AS
pork I-AS
. O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

my O
favorite O
place B-AS
lol O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-AS
Salmon I-AS
, O
Sea B-AS
Bass I-AS
and O
Crispy B-AS
Duck I-AS
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-AS
alla I-AS
marsala I-AS
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

The O
flavors O
are O
amazing O
and O
the O
value O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8:30 O
. O

Great O
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
shank I-AS
in I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

It O
's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel O
's O
Share O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O
bar O
... O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

I O
'm O
telling O
you O
... O

The O
martinis B-AS
are O
amazing O
and O
very O
fairly O
priced O
. O

Amma B-AS
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O
) O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert B-AS
and O
they O
dont O
have O
. O

Mazing O
interior B-AS
. O

( O

) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
Mott O
St. O
just O
south O
of O
bayard O

the O
pad B-AS
se I-AS
ew I-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
was O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-AS
. O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

Cute O
place B-AS
, O
nice O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B-AS
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
sat O
. O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Okay- O
i O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-AS
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

The O
portion B-AS
sizes O
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
good O
. O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
inedible O
! O

Wow O
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

THE O
SERVICE B-AS
IS O
AMAZING O
, O
i O
've O
had O
different O
waiters B-AS
and O
they O
were O
all O
nice O
, O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
in O
NYC O
. O

limited O
menu B-AS
, O
no O
- O
so O
- O
fresh O
ingredients B-AS
, O
thinly O
- O
sliced O
fish B-AS
, O
fall O
- O
apart O
rice B-AS
. O

The O
lox B-AS
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
I O
've O
ever O
encountered O
. O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
's O
frequently O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
quick O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O
pizza B-AS
in O
NYC O
! O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

Haru B-AS
on I-AS
Park I-AS
S I-AS
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block B-AS
. O

The O
place O
's O
decor B-AS
and O
hidden B-AS
bathrooms I-AS
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-AS

We O
love O
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

Entrees O
: O
Vanison O
steak O
and O
Bison O
Steak O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20's/ O
30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

Best O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-AS
and I-AS
Cypriot I-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro B-AS
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
- O
- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-AS
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-AS
urchin I-AS
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-AS
of I-AS
mirrors I-AS
. O

Good O
creative O
rolls B-AS
! O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-AS
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

This O
little O
place B-AS
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-AS
for O
your O
money O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
... O
.. O
this O
place O

to O
eat O
here O

Would O

recomend O
it O
for O
dinner O
! O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O

Always O

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O

cold O
! O

These O

you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

We O
were O

La I-AS
Femme I-AS
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O

! O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-AS
for O

friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O

, O
pre O

money O
. O

As O
a O

I O
can O

with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B-AS
Strike I-AS
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid O
- O
back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-AS
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

we O
have O
been O
there O
3 O
times O
since O
last O
week O
we O
alked O
it O
by O
chance O
first O
day O
the O

offerd O
us O
the O
margherita O
pizza O
adn O
we O
said O
yes O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-AS
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

Love O
their O
drink B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
OK O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

Sauce B-AS
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-AS
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

this O
little O
place B-AS
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

Ahhh O
... O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Just O
go O
to O
Yamato B-AS
and O
order O
the O
Red B-AS
Dragon I-AS
Roll I-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
worth O
an O
one O
- O
hour O
drive O
. O

The O
brioche B-AS
and I-AS
lollies I-AS
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
space B-AS
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
setting O
, O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu B-AS
- I-AS
Shabu I-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
Try O
- O
State O
Area O
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
good O
size O
menu B-AS
, O
great O
service B-AS
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B-AS
. O

The O
lava B-AS
cake I-AS
dessert I-AS
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria B-AS
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

Also O
, O
do O
n't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll O
, O
if O
it O
's O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
. O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

Best O
Indian B-AS
Chinese I-AS
in O
the O
city O
, O
by O
far O
! O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
wonderful O
. O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B-AS
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-AS
Kha I-AS
soup I-AS
was O
pathetic O
. O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

The O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
superb O
! O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice O
though O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
nice O
though O
service B-AS
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
) O
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

You O
want O
to O
have O
a O
real O
hot O
dog O
in O
Brooklyn O
? O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner O
- O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

Great O
Indian B-AS
Food I-AS
! O

Chennai B-AS
Garden I-AS
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
- O
especially O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
actors B-AS
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
selection I-AS
is O
good O
and O
wine B-AS
- I-AS
by I-AS
- I-AS
the I-AS
- I-AS
glass I-AS
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-AS
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
) O
. O

But O
the O
service B-AS
is O
HORRID O
! O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-AS
price I-AS
sushi I-AS
deal I-AS
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-AS
appetizers I-AS
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-AS
salad I-AS
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-AS
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

Some O
Pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

No O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average O
to O
above O
- O
average O
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-AS
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-AS
! O

Unhygienic O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
delicious O
dishes B-AS
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-AS
. O

The O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

lobster B-AS
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

Have O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
service B-AS
save O
a O
missing O
rice O
once O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
the O
prices O
. O

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
wo O
n't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

Wo O
n't O
or O
Ca O
n't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service O
directory O
. O

I O
've O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

I O
've O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place B-AS
has O
it O
all O
. O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
place B-AS
to O
anybody O
even O
for O
a O
casual O
dinner O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

Always O
good O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

Although O
the O
tables B-AS
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle B-AS
- I-AS
light I-AS
, O
food B-AS
- O
quality O
and O
service B-AS
overcompensate O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

Interesting O
selection B-AS
, O
good O
wines B-AS
, O
service B-AS
fine O
, O
fun O
decor B-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
- O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi B-AS
- I-AS
private I-AS
boths I-AS
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
were O
great O
. O

Everyone O
raved O
about O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
( O
elegant O
rooms B-AS
and O
absolutely O
incomparable O
views B-AS
) O
and O
the O
fabulous O
food B-AS
! O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
, O
but O
it O
should O
n't O
. O

Unique O
apppetizers B-AS
. O

Ruth O
, O
mother O
of O
the O
Bride O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

The O
people B-AS
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

But O
$ O
1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece O
? O
? O
? O

The O
bagels B-AS
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

The O
food B-AS
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

( O
Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
) O
. O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

Guacamole+shrimp B-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-AS
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
... O
. O

i O
've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B-AS
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O
. O

It O
's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-AS
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-AS
had O
no O
flavor O
. O

My O
chow B-AS
fun I-AS
and I-AS
chow I-AS
see I-AS
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

Vanison B-AS
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O
. O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

Love O
YUKA B-AS
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-AS
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
) O
. O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-AS
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-AS
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-AS
! O

Most O
of O
the O
booths B-AS
allow O
you O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
eachother O
without O
looking O
like O
'that O
' O
couple O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

The O
chicken B-AS
pot I-AS
pie I-AS
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
cheeseburger B-AS
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands- O
down O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

Tasty O
Dog B-AS
! O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Black I-AS
Cod I-AS
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Salmon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
better O
. O

A O
cool O
bar B-AS
with O
great O
food B-AS
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B-AS
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B-AS
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

If O
you O
go O
, O
try O
the O
marinara B-AS
/ I-AS
arrabiatta I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
the O
mozzarella B-AS
en I-AS
Carozza I-AS
is O
mmmmmmmm O
... O
.. O
everything O
is O
just O
delicious O
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

I O
've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

Was O
n't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-AS
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

Thank O
You O
Emilio B-AS
. O

great O
taste O

LOVE O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
- O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
in O
Paris O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money.. O
scammers O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B-AS
and O
the O
mahi B-AS
mahi I-AS
( I-AS
on I-AS
saffron I-AS
risotto I-AS
- O
yum O
! O
) O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great O
. O

The O
dishes B-AS
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-AS
sausages I-AS
, O
sardines B-AS
with I-AS
biscuits I-AS
, O
large B-AS
whole I-AS
shrimp I-AS
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-AS
ice I-AS
cream I-AS
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-AS
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

If O
only O
they O
delivered O
, O
they O
'd O
make O
a O
mint O
! O

The O
owner B-AS
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

Arigato O
Gozimas O
Yuka O
! O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

The O
jukebox B-AS
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes O
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-AS
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
* O
not O
* O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

Prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant B-AS
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
I O
had O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-AS
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
- O
1 O
hour O
, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo B-AS
- I-AS
chinese I-AS
food I-AS
. O

never O
swaying O
, O
never O
a O
bad O
meal B-AS
, O
never O
bad O
service B-AS
... O

bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
are O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

Excellent O
food B-AS
, O
although O
the O
interior B-AS
could O
use O
some O
help O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-AS
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend O
's O
reccomendation O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-AS
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-AS
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O
. O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

Went O
for O
Mom O
's O
birthday O
brunch/ O
lunch O
. O

Keep O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-AS
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good O
, O
the O
place B-AS
was O
clean O
and O
affordable O
. O

This O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent O
. O

Best O

It O
is O
a O

with O
Fish B-AS
bringing O
up O
the O

and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O

else O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal O
! O

They O
honored O
reservation O
on O
Sunday O
afternoon O
very O
well O
. O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-AS
. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive O
- O
though O
the O
staff B-AS
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel O
's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

We O
were O
4 O
and O
got O
the O
family O
size O
penne B-AS
a I-AS
la I-AS
vodka I-AS
which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion O
... O
a O
bucket O
of O
food O
literally O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
always O
packed O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

The O

are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O

them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect O
