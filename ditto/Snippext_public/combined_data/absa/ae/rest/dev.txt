In O
the O
summer O
months O
, O
the O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
area I-AS
is O
really O
nice O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-AS
branzino I-AS
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

Service B-AS
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
`` O
large O
party O
'' O
! O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O
, O
the O
chef O
recommended O
an O
assortment O
of O
fish O
including O
Fatty O
Yellow O
Tail O
, O
Boton O
Shrimp O
, O
Blue O
Fin O
Torro O
( O
Fatty O
Tuna O
) O
, O
Sea O
Eel O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

I O
've O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
( O
I O
live O
on O
UWS O
) O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

the O
spinach B-AS
is O
fresh O
, O
definately O
not O
frozen O
... O

Saul B-AS
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

All O
in O
all O
we O
're O
already O
coming O
up O
with O
excuses O
to O
go O
ahead O
really O
soon O
in O
the O
next O
few O
wks O
! O
! O
! O
! O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10- O
15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
band I-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad O
. O

Mussles B-AS
and O
calamari B-AS
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
brasserie I-AS
( O
that O
don O
â€™ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
deal I-AS
, O
however O
- O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

My O
quesadilla B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three O
- O
year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O
. O

food B-AS
was O
luke O
warm O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

Just O
not O
good O
at O
all O
. O

The O
rolls B-AS
are O
creative O
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
another O
sushi O
place O
that O
serves O
up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O
japanese B-AS
food I-AS
. O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B-AS
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

Not O
a O
great O
place B-AS
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

It O
's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B-AS
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

Salads B-AS
were O
fantastic O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B-AS
bathroom I-AS
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-AS
was O
n't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

But O
nonetheless O
- O
- O
great O
spot B-AS
, O
great O
food B-AS
. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip- O
off O
( O
$ O
8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns O
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

The O
seats B-AS
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

Yakitori B-AS
( I-AS
bbq I-AS
meats I-AS
) I-AS
is O
tasty O
too O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B-AS
impecable O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-AS
Noir I-AS
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

Best O
Reuben B-AS
sandwich I-AS
ever O
! O

The O
wine B-AS
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
good O
too O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

Planet B-AS
Thai I-AS
is O
great O
! O

This O
place B-AS
blew O
me O
away O
... O
by O
far O
my O
new O
favorite O
restaurant O
on O
the O
uppereast O
side O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers B-AS
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-AS
had O
no O
seasoning O
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

Pacifico B-AS
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
casually O
hang O
out O
. O

I O
completely O
recommend O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress O
your O
date O
. O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
- O
- O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Delivery B-AS
is O
fast O
too O
. O

If O
you O
've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-AS
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-AS
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
decor B-AS
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

The O
crust B-AS
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-AS
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-AS
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

Fish B-AS
was O
overdone O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
's O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B-AS
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B-AS
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B-AS
a O
try O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-AS
menu I-AS
... O
they O
're O
all O
delicious O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
for O
their O
food B-AS
, O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
wonderful O
service B-AS
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

It O
's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-AS
space I-AS
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O
. O

Great O
spot B-AS
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
either O
. O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O
. O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

I O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B-AS
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-AS
plus O
great O
service B-AS
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

10 O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
`` O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
'' O
No O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

I O
did O
n't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
so O
much O
. O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
fire B-AS
place I-AS
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B-AS
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B-AS
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-AS
. O

A O
Thai B-AS
restaurant I-AS
out O
of O
rice O
during O
dinner O
? O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
! O
! O

We O
've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

Winnie B-AS
and O
her O
staff B-AS
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O
. O

Impressed O
... O

WORST O
PLACE B-AS
ON O
SMITH O
STREET O
IN O
BROOKLYN O

Tiny O
dessert B-AS
was O
$ O
8.00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Love O
Pizza B-AS
33 I-AS
.. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
hidden O
away O
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
there O
, O
it O
's O
all O
worth O
it O
. O

Friendly O
staff B-AS
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you O
're O
with O
. O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

Just O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B-AS
is O
nasty O
, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT O
! O

My O
bf O
and O
I O
go O
to O
the O
walk- O
up O
counter O
and O
order O
a O
pie O

I O
never O

on O

this O
restaurant B-AS
is O

commending O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
n't O

, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
bad O
service B-AS
and O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

They O
are O

The O

the O
service B-AS
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
magnificant O
. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O

The O
service B-AS
is O
good O
and O

is O
good O
for O
a O

which O
means O
: O
simple O
dishes B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
served O
efficiently O
in O

Volare O
virgins O

Warm O

The O

The O
best O

thai I-AS
i O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
were O
n't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
Family O
feel B-AS
, O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions B-AS
which O
are O
enormous O
; O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

It O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B-AS
sauce I-AS
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

This O
place B-AS

better O
Shanghai O
place O
