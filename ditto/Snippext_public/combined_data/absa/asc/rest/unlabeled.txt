If you 're going to chop meat into small slices and cure them with salt to keep them fresh ( anybody with half a brain knows that when u cut a piece of meat into thin slices like korean grill house does , it dries out quicker and adding salt to it makes it last longer so you can sell it to the masses before it expires ) you can at least let us have large water glasses to stay hydrated instead of making the poor kids working the floor fill up our water glasses every 30 seconds .	meat	neutral
