But O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
so B-OP
horrible I-OP
to O
us O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
above B-OP
average I-OP
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies B-OP
of I-OP
Teodora B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
uniformly O
exceptional B-OP
, O
with O
a O
very B-OP
capable I-OP
kitchen B-AS
which O
will O
proudly O
whip O
up O
whatever O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
, O
whether O
it O
s O
on O
the O
menu O
or O
not O
. O

Where O
Gabriela O
personaly O
greets O
you O
and O
recommends O
you O
what O
to O
eat O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
food B-AS
outstanding B-OP
, O
but O
the O
little O
perks O

were O
great O
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

Our O
agreed O
favorite B-OP
is O
the O
orrechiete B-AS
with I-AS
sausage I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
( O
usually O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
kind B-OP
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish O
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats O
) O
. O

The O
Bagels B-AS
have O
an O
outstanding B-OP
taste B-AS
with O
a O
terrific B-OP
texture B-AS
, O
both O
chewy B-OP
yet O
not B-OP
gummy I-OP
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
food B-AS
itself O
is O
pretty B-OP
good I-OP
. O

i O
ve O
noticed O
megadeth O
, O
mr. O
scruff O
, O
st. O
germain O
, O
traditional B-OP
vietnamese B-AS
songs I-AS
, O
black O
sabbath O
, O
jay-z O
, O
and O
daft O
punk O
all O
being O
played O
. O

They O
did O
not B-OP
have I-OP
mayonnaise B-AS
, O
forgot B-OP
our O
toast B-AS
, O
left B-OP
out I-OP
ingredients B-AS
( O
ie O
cheese O
in O
an O
omelet O
) O
, O
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B-AS
was O
so O
over B-OP
cooked I-OP
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate B-AS
when O
you O
touched O
it O
. O

It O
took B-OP
half I-OP
an I-OP
hour I-OP
to O
get O
our O
check B-AS
, O
which O
was O
perfect O
since O
we O
could O
sit O
, O
have O
drinks O
and O
talk O
! O

The O
design B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
just O
as O
good B-OP
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite B-OP
expert I-OP
on I-OP
the O
cuisine B-AS
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
Mary O
s O
and O
am O
making O
it O
one O
of O
my O
regular B-OP
neighborhood B-AS
haunts I-AS
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
the O
best B-OP
if O
you O
like O
thin O
crusted O
pizza O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping B-OP
place B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time B-AS
! O

He O
ca O
n't O
help O
, O
they O
re O
bought O
up O
so O
fast O
. O

Secondly O
, O
on O
this O
night O
the O
place B-AS
was O
overwhelmed B-OP
by O
upper O
east O
side O
ladies O
perfume O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer B-OP
convenience B-AS
. O

Obviously O
run O
by O
folks O
who O
know O
a O
pie O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

IT O
IS O
DEFINITELY O
SPECIAL O
AND O
AFFORDABLE O
. O

I O
really O
liked B-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

All O
the O
money O
went O
into O
the O
interior O
decoration O
, O
none O
of O
it O
went O
to O
the O
chefs O
. O

The O
seats B-AS
are O
uncomfortable B-OP
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
seltzer O
with O
lime O
, O
no O
ice O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
alone O
-- O
-even O
two O
people O
is O
n't O
enough O
for O
the O
whole O
experience O
, O
with O
pickles O
and O
a O
selection O
of O
meats O
and O
seafoods O
. O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat O
family B-OP
style B-AS
because O
you O
ll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm B-OP
vibe B-AS
, O
the O
owner B-AS
is O
super B-OP
friendly I-OP
and O
service B-AS
is O
fast B-OP
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
value O
joint O
. O

Faan O
s O
got O
a O
great B-OP
concept B-AS
but O
a O
little B-OP
rough I-OP
on O
the O
delivery B-AS
. O

From O
the O
incredible B-OP
food B-AS
, O
to O
the O
warm B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
to O
the O
friendly B-OP
service B-AS
, O
this O
downtown B-OP
neighborhood B-AS
spot I-AS
does O
n't O
miss O
a O
beat O
. O

Great B-OP
food B-AS
at O
REASONABLE B-OP
prices B-AS
, O
makes O
for O
an O
evening O
that O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O

Look O
foward O
to O
trying O
the O
Ruben O
upon O
returning O
. O

The O
only O
other O
steakhouse O
that O
seems O
to O
hold O
a O
candle O
to O
Roth O
s O
is O
the O
Strip O
House O
. O

We O
usually O
go O
to O
the O
Chart O
House O
to O
celebrate B-OP
a O
birthday B-AS
or I-AS
anniversary I-AS
. O

this O
little B-OP
place B-AS
has O
a O
cute B-OP
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
and O
affordable B-OP
city O
prices B-AS
. O

You O
ll O
adore O
it O
. O

Two O
words O
: O
Free B-OP
wine B-AS
. O

The O
price B-AS
is O
reasonable B-OP
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor B-OP
. O

The O
quantity B-AS
is O
also O
very B-OP
good I-OP
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth O
s O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

Worth B-OP
visiting B-AS
the O
1st O
Ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original B-OP
store B-AS
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second B-OP
floor I-OP
walk-up B-AS
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L.A O
. O
Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

Raga O
s O
is O
a O
romantic B-OP
, O
cozy B-OP
restaurant B-AS
. O

The O
fried B-AS
rice I-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
here O
. O

Three O
courses O
- O
choices O
include O
excellent B-OP
mussels B-AS
, O
puff B-AS
pastry I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
and O
salad B-AS
with B-OP
a I-OP
delicious I-OP
dressing I-OP
, O
and O
a O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
au I-AS
poivre I-AS
that O
is O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

it O
s O
a O
perfect B-OP
place B-AS
to O
have O
a O
amanzing B-OP
indian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
so O
cool B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt B-OP
and O
curtious B-OP
. O

At O
the O
end O
you O
re O
left O
with O
a O
mild B-OP
broth B-AS
with I-AS
noodles I-AS
that O
you O
can O
slurp O
out O
of O
a O
cup O
. O

I O
just O
wonder O
how O
you O
can O
have O
such O
a O
delicious B-OP
meal B-AS
for O
such O
little B-OP
money B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
. O

so O
garantuan O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
fit O
them O
in O
a O
toaster O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best B-OP
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
s O
of O
course O
) O
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
Sophia B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

Whem O
asked O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
more O
detailed O
questions O
so O
that O
we O
knew O
what O
the O
specials O
were O
. O

This O
is O
a O
consistently B-OP
great I-OP
place B-AS
to I-AS
dine I-AS
for I-AS
lunch I-AS
or I-AS
dinner I-AS
. O

Nice B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very B-OP
pleasant I-OP
and O
the O
desert B-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

All O
the O
people O
that O
I O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
THEIR O
friends O
! O

After O
really B-OP
enjoying I-OP
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

Fabulous B-OP
service B-AS
, O
fantastic B-OP
food B-AS
, O
and O
a O
chilled B-OP
out I-OP
atmosphere B-AS
and O
environment B-AS
. O

Not O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
hear O
. O

Try O
the O
lasagnette O
appetizer O
. O

Pricey O
, O
but O
worth B-OP
a O
try B-AS
, O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
end O
up O
sitting O
next O
to O
some O
pretty B-OP
odd I-OP
people B-AS
. O

I O
liked B-OP
the O
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
! O

Great O
food B-AS
, O
good B-OP
size O
menu B-AS
, O
great B-OP
service B-AS
and O
an O
unpretensious B-OP
setting B-AS
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic B-OP
dinner B-AS
but O
not B-OP
for I-OP
an I-OP
all I-OP
out I-OP
wow I-OP
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
eating O
Dosa O
and O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
NY O
to O
satisfy O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
selection I-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
wine-by-the-glass B-AS
was O
generously B-OP
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

With O
the O
great B-OP
variety B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
menu I-AS
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
very B-OP
limited I-OP
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
carnivore O
, O
come O
hungry O
and O
you O
will O
leave O
more O
satisfied O
than O
you O
have O
ever O
been O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited B-OP
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
. O

Not B-OP
too I-OP
crazy I-OP
about O
their O
sake B-AS
martini I-AS
. O

Great B-OP
bagels B-AS
, O
spreads B-AS
and O
a O
good B-OP
place B-AS
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys B-OP
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they O
re O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

whoever O
the O
jazz B-AS
duo I-AS
was O
, O
they O
were O
on B-OP
POINT I-OP
. O

One O
thing O
I O
liked B-OP
about O
this O
place B-AS
is O
that O
I O
never O
felt O
rushed O
or O
pressured O
to O
give O
up O
my O
table O
ot O
incoming O
guests O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
bargain I-OP
. O

We O
happened O
upon O
this O
place B-AS
purely O
by O
accident O
and O
were O
pleased B-OP
with O
the O
results O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding B-OP
, O
but O
everything B-AS
else O
about O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
pits B-OP
. O

Deff O
recimmend O
Bukhara O
they O
also O
have O
opened O
two O
new O
locations O
guess O
ill O
try O
them O
out O
. O

We O
always O
have O
a O
delicious B-OP
meal B-AS
and O
always O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
. O

Dip O
the O
ingredients O
in O
with O
your O
chopsticks O
, O
swirl O
them O
around O
, O
and O
eat O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy B-OP
their O
garden B-AS
terrace I-AS
. O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O
. O

Everyone B-AS
I O
have O
spoken O
too O
there O
is O
super B-OP
friendly I-OP
, O
helpful B-OP
, O
and O
willing O
to O
the O
extra O
mile O
for O
a O
customer O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
pretty B-OP
good I-OP
and O
huge B-OP
. O

Sapphire O
is O
the O
only O
Indian O
restaurant O
I O
go O
to O
when O
I O
m O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
cuisine B-AS
from O
what O
I O
ve O
gathered O
is O
authentic B-OP
Taiwanese I-OP
, O
though O
its O
very B-OP
different I-OP
from O
what O
I O
ve O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
Taipei O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
places B-AS
in O
NYC O
to O
make O
new O
friends O
and O
catch O
up O
with O
old O
ones O
. O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
so B-OP
great I-OP
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become B-AS
to O
crowded B-OP
. O

They O
are O
often O
crowded B-OP
on O
the O
weekends B-AS
but O
they O
are O
efficient B-OP
and O
accurate B-OP
with O
their O
service B-AS
. O

All O
my O
co-workers O
were O
amazed O
at O
how O
small B-OP
the O
dish B-AS
was O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
unheralded B-OP
, O
the O
service B-AS
impecible B-OP
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
magnificant B-OP
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-AS
branzino I-AS
, O
that O
was O
so B-OP
infused I-OP
with I-OP
bone I-OP
, O
it O
was O
difficult B-OP
to I-OP
eat B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
has O
gotten O
better B-OP
and I-OP
better I-OP
! O

This O
place B-AS
, O
which O
is O
only O
a B-OP
few I-OP
months I-OP
old I-OP
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O

biggest O
secret O
! O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed B-OP
on O
weekends B-AS
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
it O
is O
the O
best B-OP
French B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much B-OP
fun I-OP
. O

I O
was O
glad O
I O
did O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
cozy I-OP
place B-AS
with O
good B-OP
pizza B-AS
. O

I O
ve O
never O
been O
treated B-AS
so B-OP
rudely I-OP
. O

I O
ll O
be O
back O
soon O
. O

Le O
Pere O
Pinard O
has O
a O
$ O
15 O
pre-theater B-AS
menu I-AS
that O
is O
outstanding B-OP
. O

Went O
inside O
and O
I O
started O
to O
get O
excited O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
for O
delivery O
and O
the O
restaurant O
forgot B-OP
half I-OP
the O
order B-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
checked B-OP
on I-OP
us I-OP
maybe I-OP
twice I-OP
during O
the O
entire O
meal O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
Montparnasse O
many O
times O
and O
return O
often O
for O
good O
reason O
. O

The O
strong B-OP
scents B-AS
coming O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
of O
me O
negatively O
affected O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC B-OP
. O

It O
s O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

If O
you O
wrote O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
it O
s O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
what O
Rao O
s O
is O
all O
about O
. O

Had O
we O
been O
stalling O
I O

understand O
where O
they O
were O
coming O

overall O
i O
give O
it O

Though O
the O
Spider B-AS

may O
look O
like O
a O
challenge B-OP
to I-OP
eat I-OP
, O
with O
soft O
shell O
crab O
hanging O
out O
of O
the O
roll O
, O
it O

well B-OP
worth I-OP
the O

Deep B-AS

the O
different B-OP
varieties I-OP
of I-OP
congee B-AS
( I-AS
rice I-AS

Their O

This O

one O
of O
the O
BEST B-OP
restaurants B-AS
I O

An O

From O
the O
terrible B-OP
service B-AS
, O
to O
the O
bland B-OP
food B-AS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
unaccommodating B-OP
managers B-AS
, O
the O
overall B-AS
experience I-AS

Not B-OP
impressed I-OP
with O
the O

. O

The O
entire O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
! O

The O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
( O
by O
the O
glass O
and O
bottle O
) O
is O
wonderful B-OP
and O
I O
always O
recommend B-OP
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
if O
they O
re O
going O
to O
be O
in O
town O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
highly O
refined B-OP
: O
our O
seating B-AS
was O
delayed B-OP
35 I-OP
minutes I-OP
past I-OP
our I-OP
reservation I-OP
and O
the O
maitre O

apologized O

Order O
the O

Food B-AS

usually O
very B-OP
good I-OP
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered B-OP
about O
freshmess B-AS
of I-AS
raw I-AS
vegatables I-AS
in O
side O
orders O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
crappy B-OP
service B-AS
from O
two O
individuals O
, O
it O
s O
great O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

Wondering O
who O
had O
the O
best B-OP
deals B-AS
we O
noticed O
a O
line O
had O
formed O
to O
wait O
for O
this O
one O
particular O
establishment O
. O

They O
have O
authentic B-OP
Indian B-AS
at O
amazin B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

You O
are O
treated B-AS
just O
like B-OP
royality I-OP
. O

There O
s O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O

or O
more O
) O
. O

Ambiance- B-AS
relaxed B-OP
and O
stylish B-OP
. O

I O
ve O
never O
felt B-AS
more B-OP
unwelcome I-OP
than O
last O
month O
at O
Jimmy O

Bronx O
Cafe O
. O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ O
Salmon O
, O
Sea O
Bass O
and O
Crispy O
Duck O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy B-OP
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy B-OP
ingredients B-AS
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good B-OP
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right B-OP
. O

Looking O
from O
the O
outside O
in O
, O
one O
would O
hesitate O
to O
enter O
this O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
( O
really O
, O
that O
s O
what O
it O
is O
) O
. O

and O
yes O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
is O
so O
dam B-OP
good I-OP
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

I O
ve O
been O
coming O
here O
as O
a O
child O
and O
always O
come O
back O
for O
the O
taste O
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
one O
of O
those O
comfortable B-OP
neighborhood B-AS
joints O
where O
you O
know O
you O
will O
always O
have O
a O
good B-OP
meal B-AS
at O
a O
fair B-OP
price B-AS
. O

A O
glass O
of O
Leaping O
Lizard O
, O
a O
glass O
of O
prosecco O
, O
and O
the O
mussels O
had O
everything O
happy O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
average B-OP
and O
creme B-AS
brulee I-AS
was O
awful B-OP
- O
the O
sugar B-AS
was O
charred B-OP
, O
not B-OP
caramelized I-OP
and O
smelled B-OP
of I-OP
kerosene I-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
always O
tastes B-OP
fresh I-OP
and O
served B-AS
promptly B-OP
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
here O
is O
delicious B-OP
. O

My O
entire O
family B-AS
was O
horrified B-OP
. O

On O
a O
monthly O
basis O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
get O
together O
and O
have O
a O
girls O
night O
out O
. O

Pizza B-AS
and O
garlic B-AS
knots I-AS
are O
great B-OP
as O
well O
, O
I O
order O
from O
them O
quite O
often O
and O
the O
delivery B-AS
is O
always O
super B-OP
quick I-OP
! O

For O
great O
chinese O
food O
nearby O
, O
you O
have O
Wu O
Liang O
Ye O
and O
Grand O
Sichuan O
just O
a O
block O
away O
. O

But O
who O
says O
Murray O
s O
is O
anything B-OP
about I-OP
service B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
really B-OP
trendi I-OP
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red O
Eye O
. O

Hats B-OP
off I-OP
to O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

This O
should O
have O
been O
done O
in O
a O
back O
room O
- O
away O
from O
customers O
. O

Service B-AS
could O
be O
improved B-OP
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place B-AS
that O
understands B-OP
the I-OP
importance I-OP
of I-OP
little I-OP
things I-OP
( O
the O
heavy O
, O
black O
, O
antique-seeming B-OP
teapot B-AS
, O
for O
one O
) O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
. O

Glad O
you O
have O
the O
luxury O
to O
throw O
out O
paying O
customers O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-OP
mozzarella B-AS
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria O
s O
. O

Its O
an O
excellent B-OP
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
in O
the O
city O
of O
New O
York O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
, O
and O
never B-OP
had I-OP
a I-OP
problem I-OP
walking B-AS
in I-AS
and O
getting B-AS
a I-AS
table I-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
crowded B-OP
but O
it O
was O
a O
great B-OP
bistro-type B-AS
vibe I-AS
. O

Check O
it O
out O

First O
off O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
was O
completely B-OP
unattentive I-OP
the O
2 O
times O
we O
saw O
her O
( O
odd B-OP
in O
a O
restaurant B-AS
with O
6 O
tables O
) O
and O
got O
our O
order B-AS
wrong B-OP
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
oily I-OP
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

What O
is O
even O
better O
, O
is O
that O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
very B-OP
affordable I-OP
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
really B-OP
good I-OP
. O

The O
fish B-AS
is O
fresh B-OP
but O
the O
variety B-AS
of I-AS
fish I-AS
is O
nothing B-OP
out I-OP
of I-OP
ordinary I-OP
. O

Look O
I O
dont O
know O
if O
the O
people O
who O
wrote O
the O
reviews O
have O
ever O
been O
to O
a O
decent O
place O
( O
PLEASE O
TRY O
SOMEOTHER O

. O

Suan O

Our O
favorite B-OP
meal B-AS
is O

pesto O
pizza O

and O
a O
good B-OP
bottle B-AS
of I-AS

. O

And O
Kruno O
, O
the O
beverage O
manager O
is O
the O
best B-OP
bartender B-AS
I O
have O
yet O
to O
come O
across O
. O

Ambiance B-AS
and O
music B-AS
funky B-OP
, O
which O
I O
enjoy B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
are O
clearly O
among B-OP
the I-OP
best I-OP
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite B-OP
size I-OP
food B-AS
and O
refleshment B-AS
with O
my O
date O
. O

It O
s O
a O
really B-OP
great I-OP
deal B-AS
, O
considering O
we O
got O
full O
off O
of O
four O
dollars O
. O

I O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic B-OP
, O
alluring B-OP
ambiance B-AS
or O
the O
five B-OP
star I-OP
service B-AS
featuring O

salmon O
! O

I O
am O
completely B-OP
hooked I-OP
on O
this O
place B-AS
, O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere O
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
s O
a O
very B-OP
disappointing I-OP
experience B-AS
. O

Granted O
the O
space B-AS
is O
smaller B-OP
than O
most O
, O
it O
is O
the O
best B-OP
service B-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
even O
the O
largest O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Have O
recommended B-OP
the O

This O

one O
of O
my O
favorite B-OP

it O
is O
not O
to O

( O
La O
Rosa O
is O
connected O
by O
a O
swinging O
door O
to O
the O
Mexican O
restaurant O
Pacifico O
) O
. O

It O
could O
have O
been O
handled O
better O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive B-OP
and O
her O
suggestions O
of O
menu B-AS
items I-AS
was O
right B-OP
on I-OP

the O
Outstanding B-OP
Pizza B-AS
! O

It O
s O
a O
rather O
cramped B-OP
and O
busy B-OP
restaurant B-AS
and O
it O
closes B-AS
early B-OP
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
romantic B-OP
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
horrible B-OP
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
pathetic B-OP
, O
and O
gabriella O
lies O
about O
everything O
she O
could O
. O

We O
had O
crawfish B-AS
boiled B-OP
and O
despite O
making O
a O
mess O
, O
it O
was O
a B-OP
ton I-OP
of I-OP
fun I-OP
and O
quite B-OP
tasty I-OP
as O
well O
. O

I O
had O
very O
high B-OP
expectations I-OP
for O
this O
place B-AS
and O
made O
a O
reservation O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft B-OP
fluffy I-OP
interior B-AS
. O

What O
came O
to O
our O
table O
was O
burned O
beyond O
recognition O
and O
stringy O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
and O
the O
noodles B-AS
were O
sticky B-OP
. O

So O
I O
ve O
never O
actually O
been O
to O
M O
proper O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
had O
it O
delivered O
a O
few O
times O
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
values B-AS
for I-AS
your I-AS
money I-AS
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
is O
rude B-OP
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive B-OP
. O

If O
you O
re O
craving O
for O
Haru O

great B-OP

especially O
the O
House O

Succulent B-AS

your O
desired B-OP
doneness B-AS

accompanied O
by O
salads O
and O
sides O
that O

Lunch O

pickels B-AS
and I-AS
slaw I-AS
, O
no B-OP

Decent B-OP

even O
the O

good B-OP

Nice B-OP
Family I-OP
owned I-OP
traditional I-OP
restaurant B-AS
. O

would O
have O
rather O
tried O
terrace O
in O
the O
sky O
or O
water O
club O
for O
that O
price O

This O
dish B-AS
is O
my O
favorite B-OP
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

Okay B-OP
service B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful B-OP
than O
the O
food B-AS
( O
which O
is O
exceptional B-OP
) O
is O
the O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
very B-OP
pleasantly I-OP
surprised B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
just O
awful B-OP
, O
ATROCIOUS B-OP
actually O
. O

I O
will O
never B-OP
visit I-OP
this B-AS
restaurant I-AS
again I-AS
. O

The O
soup O
for O
the O
udon O
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

The O
anti-pasta B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling B-AS
pasta I-AS
mains I-AS
. O

The O
waitress O
suggested O
glasses B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
that O
went O
very B-OP
well I-OP
with I-OP
the I-OP
food I-OP
. O

( O
or O
sister O
, O
in O
my O
case O
! O
) O
. O

I O
ve O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

They O
might O
be O
all O
business O
at O
the O
counter O
when O
you O
give O
your O
order O
, O
but O
their O
food O
says O
I O
love O
you O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi O
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche O
mix O
( O
special O
) O
, O
crab O
dumplings O
, O
assorted O
sashimi O
, O
sushi O
and O
rolls O
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake O
, O
and O
the O
banana O
tempura O
. O

Try O
their O
plain O
pizza O
with O
fresh B-OP
garlic B-AS
or I-AS
eggplant I-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
there O
! O

Ok O
, O
so O
the O
servers B-AS
wander O
around O
a B-OP
little I-OP
clueless I-OP
, O
but O
there O
s O
more B-OP
than I-OP
enough I-OP
servers B-AS
for O
the O
crowd O
they O
get O
-- O
it O
s O
fine O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
make O
a O
small O
effort O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
. O

Good B-OP
luck I-OP
getting B-AS
a I-AS
table I-AS
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
were O
n't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

Do O
n't O
look O
down O
your O
nose O
at O
me O
like O
that O
... O

Planet B-AS
Thai I-AS
is O
great B-OP
! O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful B-OP
. O

Just O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy B-OP
wannabes B-AS
. O

The O
takeout O
menu O
says O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
an O
expanded B-AS
menu I-AS
offering B-OP
more I-OP
italian I-OP
dishes I-OP
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
! O

Trust O
me O
, O
it O
will O
be O
great O
, O
and O
all O
of O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O
in O
no O
time O
. O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O.G O
. O
again O
last O
night O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
had O
one O
near O
my O
office- O
I O
would O
go O
everyday O
. O

Finally O
! O

Amma O
has O
the O
worst B-OP
value B-AS
for I-AS
money I-AS
I O
have O
experienced O
in O
NYC O
over O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

I O
think O
this O
would O
be O
a O
pretty B-OP
good I-OP
spot B-AS
if O
it O
were O
not B-OP
so I-OP
overpriced I-OP
and I-OP
overrated I-OP
. O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
are O
two O
people O
or O
two O
hundred O
people O
ahead O
of O
you O
the O
hostess O
will O
take O
your O
name O
and O
tell O
you O
Five O
minutes O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
good B-OP
though I-OP
. O

bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
are O
cheap B-OP
and O
good B-OP
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

Walk-ins B-AS
are O
risky B-OP
too O
. O

The O
have O
over B-OP
100 I-OP
different I-OP
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend B-OP
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

They O
did O
n't O
give O
us O
the O
dinner O
special O
until O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-AS
lasagna I-AS
which O
is O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
and O
the O
chocolate O
bread O
pudding O
for O
dessert O
. O

word O
of O
advice O
, O
save O
room O
for O
pasta O
dishes O
and O
never O
leave O
until O
you O
ve O
had O
the O
tiramisu O
. O

Very B-OP
good I-OP
service B-AS
and O
very B-OP
good I-OP
prices B-AS
. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing B-OP
time B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable B-OP
and O
unobtrusive B-OP
-- O
the O
staff O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
, O
present O
your O
meal O
, O
and O
attend B-OP
to I-OP
your B-AS
needs I-AS
. O

Ess-A-Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best B-OP
bagel B-AS
in O
NY O
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
too O
! O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I O
m O
a O
night O
person O
) O

The O
most O
annoying O
thing O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
servers O
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
to O
drive O
revenue O
. O

Get O
your O
food O
to O
go O
, O
find O
a O
bench O
, O
and O
kick O
back O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
dumplings O
. O

Please O
try O
the O
Filet O
Mignon O
, O
its O
just O
the O
most B-OP
tender I-OP
piece B-AS
ever O
. O

Everything B-AS
we O
had O
was O
pretty B-OP
good I-OP
, O
but O
we O
have O
only O
been O
there O
once O
. O

We O
were O
still O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
while O
we O
drank O
the O
sangria O
, O
but O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
bar O
when O
we O
turned O
back O
around O
, O
the O
$ O
2 O
was O
gone O
the O
people O
next O
to O
us O
said O
the O
bartender O
took O
it O
. O

Something O
about O
them O
being O
busy B-OP
with I-OP
holiday B-AS
party I-AS
s O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
menu I-AS
should B-OP
not I-OP
be I-OP
overlooked I-OP
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

the O
drinks B-AS
are O
amazing B-OP
and O
half O
off O
till O
8:00 PM O
. O

i O
ve O
been O
back O
to O
nha O
trang O
literally O
a O
hundred O
times O
for O
the O
beef B-AS
cubes I-AS
- O
they O
re O
that O
good B-OP
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent B-OP
find B-AS
! O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated B-OP
restaurants B-AS
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
service B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
ambiance B-AS
are O
all O
outstanding B-OP
and O
deserve B-OP
recognition I-OP
. O

Went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
2 B-AS
year I-AS
anniversery I-AS
, O
and O
was B-OP
n't I-OP
all I-OP
that I-OP
impressed I-OP
. O

It O
was O
rather O
pathetic O
that O
it O
took O
them O
over B-OP
an I-OP
hour I-OP
to I-OP
seat B-AS
us O
. O

We O
were O
seated B-AS
promptly B-OP
as O
we O
had O
reservations O
, O
however O
after O
that O
the O
service B-AS
was O
slow B-OP
. O

At O
first O
I O
was O
slightly O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
NYC O
. O

It O
s O
really O
also O
the O
service B-AS
, O
is O
good B-OP
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
friendly B-OP
. O

Suan B-AS
was O
a O
recommendation B-OP
that O
I O
am O
glad O
we O
heeded O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty B-OP
good I-OP
, O
but O
a O
little B-OP
flavorless I-OP
and O
the O
portions B-AS
very B-OP
small I-OP
, O
including O
dessert B-AS
. O

We O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far B-OP
from I-OP
the O
small B-AS
street I-AS
it O
s O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no B-OP
traffic B-AS
noise I-AS
. O

Also O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
popular B-OP
with I-OP
families I-OP
, O
so O
if O
you O
re O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
, O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O

I O
ll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

Lived O
in O
Shanghai O
most O
of O
my O
life O
and O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
comparable B-OP
to O
the O
flagship O
Green O
Bo O
restaurant O
there O
. O

I O
highly B-OP
recommend I-OP
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
s O
for O
their O
food B-AS
, O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
wonderful B-OP
service B-AS
. O

However O
, O
it O
s O
not B-OP
worth I-OP
a O
special B-AS
trip I-AS
. O

Nice B-OP
value B-AS
. O

Gigino O
s O
in O
Wagner B-AS
Park I-AS
is O
so B-OP
enjoyable I-OP
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
restaurant B-AS
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good B-OP
place B-AS
to O
host O
an O
intimate B-OP
dinner B-AS
meeting I-AS
with O
business O
associates O
. O

All O
the O
NYU O
students O
love B-OP
this O
place B-AS
so O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
fun B-OP
young I-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

The O
food O
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O
is O
... O
) O
. O

But O
, O
nothing B-OP
stands I-OP
out I-OP
about O
the O
cooking B-AS
. O

Joya O
used O
to O
be O
a O
cool B-OP
spot B-AS
with O
decent B-OP
food B-AS
and O
a O
colorful B-OP
- O
if O
not B-OP
relaxed I-OP
- O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

If O
that O
s O
a O
problem O
, O
go O
to O
McDonald O
s O
and O
destroy O
your O
insides O
. O

The O
Prix B-AS
Fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
worth B-OP
every I-OP
penny I-OP
and O
you O
get O
more B-OP
than I-OP
enough I-OP
( O
both O
in O
quantity B-AS
AND O
quality B-AS
) O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
here O
3 O
times O
for O
lunch O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst B-OP
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

I O
work O
near-by O
, O
and O
they O
have O
the O
BEST B-OP
oatmeal B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood- O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick-cooked O
item O
. O

Always B-OP
busy B-AS
but O
fast B-OP
moving B-AS
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food O
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked B-OP
good I-OP
, O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
Chilean O
Sea O
Bass O
, O
but O
the O
server O
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials O
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
. O

Sexy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
really B-OP
good I-OP
, O
I O
had O
the O
onion B-AS
soup I-AS
and O
it O
was O
one B-OP
of I-OP
the I-OP
best I-OP
ever O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
say O
, O
this O
Bengali O
Fast B-AS
Food I-AS
joint O
is O
clearly O
my O
favorite B-OP
. O

I O
m O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
solid B-OP
restaurant B-AS
and O
at O
less O
than O
$ O
40pp O
( O
including O
wine O
) O
, O
a O
solid B-OP
deal B-AS
as O
well O
. O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete B-OP
hole B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
wall I-AS
, O
it O
s O
a B-OP
bit I-OP
intimidating I-OP
at O
first O
, O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
welcomes O
you O
- O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
, O
but O
definitely B-OP
not I-OP
for I-OP
Dim B-AS
Sum I-AS
again O
. O

It O
costs B-AS
$ B-OP
2 I-OP
extra I-OP
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
s O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

Even O
with O
John O
s O
and O
Joe O
s O
around O
the O
corner O
, O
this O
place O
will O
make O
a O
name O
for O
itself O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
did O
, O
he O
was O
unable B-OP
to I-OP
make I-OP
a O
gin B-AS
and I-AS
tonic I-AS
-- O
could O
n't O
find O
tonic O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
convinced O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
other O
night O
for O
a O
quick B-OP
bite B-AS
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
is O
ok B-OP
but O
does B-OP
n't I-OP
taste I-OP
that I-OP
fresh I-OP
, O
and O
the O
little B-AS
dishes I-AS
do B-OP
n't I-OP
look I-OP
steamy I-OP
hot I-OP
as O
they O
should O
( O
also O
note O
lack B-OP
of I-OP
Chinese B-AS
here O
) O
. O

despite O
the O
untasteful B-OP
previous B-AS
review I-AS
... O

Do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

Sure O
, O
everyone O
s O
got O
their O
favorite O
, O
but O
to O
know O
Sal O
, O
is O
to O
know O
New O
York O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely B-OP
brilliant I-OP
and I-OP
well I-OP
runned I-OP
business B-AS
operation I-AS
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok B-OP
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good B-OP
authentic I-OP
Thai B-AS
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

I O
recommend B-OP
getting O
a O
reservation B-AS
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately B-OP
enjoyed I-OP
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

This O
is O
as O
good B-OP
as O
neighborhood B-AS
restaurants I-AS
come O
. O

If O
you O
want O
some O
roast O
duck O
, O
pork O
or O
chicken O
on O
rice O
with O
ginger O
, O
try O
them O
out O
! O

You O
order O
from O
a O
menu O
, O
so O
you O
leave O
feeling O
like O
you O
missed B-OP
the O
full B-AS

The O

was O
terrific B-OP
and O
the O

classy B-OP

This O

an O
amazing B-OP

the O

the O

we O

only O
a O

Quick B-OP

friendly I-OP
service B-AS

Authentic B-OP
bistro B-AS
! O

They O
are O
tasty O
, O
but O
I O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat O
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
American O
digestive O
system O
. O

Somewhat O
pricey O
but O
what O
the O
heck O
. O

It O
s O
TRUE O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
not B-OP
cheap I-OP
. O

Try O
the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
too O
, O
they O
re O
snappy B-OP
and O
delicious B-OP
. O

Delivery B-AS
is O

Being O

any O
good O

while O
watching O

The O
noise B-AS
level I-AS
was O
unbearable B-OP

impossible B-OP

Personal B-AS

the O
perfect B-OP

Highly B-OP

One O

Thanks O

The O

an O

Oh O

I O
should O
probably O
say O
something O
nice O

Odd O
for O

not O
just O
odd O
, O
The O

attracts O
an O
eclectic O
crowd O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

When O
we O

on O

we O

Go O

If O

without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
greatest B-OP
pizzerias B-AS
in I-AS
existence I-AS
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
and O
minimalist B-OP
, O
food B-AS
simple B-OP
yet O
very B-OP
well I-OP
presented I-OP
and I-OP
cooked I-OP
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
matches B-OP
the I-OP
food I-OP
very I-OP
well I-OP
. O

I O
had O
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
while O
it O
was O
fine B-OP
, O
for O
the O
price O
paid O
, O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
flavor O
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
tuna B-AS
melt I-AS
- O
it O
came O
with B-OP
out I-OP
cheese I-OP
which O
just O
made O
it O
a O
tuna O
sandwich O
. O

Especially O
liked B-OP
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
and O
the O
naan B-AS
, O
and O
the O
dals B-AS
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
were O
not B-OP
attentive I-OP
except O
that O
the O
bill O
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
looks I-AS
out O
over O
beautiful B-OP

My O
wife O

I O
always O
enjoy O

not B-OP
always I-OP
well I-OP
trained I-OP
but O
nevertheless O
friendly B-OP
, O
staff B-AS
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

We O
generally O
like O
good O
restaurants O
and O
eat O
out O
often O
but O
Kai B-AS
was O
way B-OP
to I-OP
expensive I-OP
for O
what O
we O
got O
. O

What O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
was O
pretty B-OP
tasty I-OP
and O
good B-OP
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
here O
unless O
you O
re O
starving O
for O
thai O
food O
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O
. O

This O
tiny B-OP
Williamsburg B-AS
spot I-AS
is O
always B-OP
pleasantly I-OP
surprising I-OP
. O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great B-OP
food B-AS
plus O
great B-OP
service B-AS
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place B-AS
to O
AVOID B-OP
! O

I O
had O
the O
best B-OP
ravioli B-AS
ever O
. O

While O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
n't O
especially O
groundbreaking B-OP
, O
everything B-AS
I O
ve O
tried O
so O
far O
has O
been O
well-executed B-OP
and O
tasty B-OP
. O

Ive O
been O
here O
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
now O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
always B-OP
outstanding I-OP
. O

The O
bill B-AS
is O
approximately B-OP
$ I-OP
25 I-OP
for I-OP
2 I-OP
at O
lunch O
without O
drinks O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst B-OP
sushi B-AS
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
, O
service B-AS
is O
ok B-OP
. O

The O
overall B-AS
price I-AS
tag I-AS
was O
very B-OP
very I-OP
expensive I-OP
, O
something O
I O
did O
expect O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
were O
done O
, O
it O
was O
past O
1:00 AM O
. O

Spice O
is O
great B-OP
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
love O
the O
inexpensive B-OP
appetizers B-AS
. O

Read O
all O
the O
other O
review O
, O
they O
ll O
confirm O
it O
. O

Even O
after O
they B-AS
overcharged B-OP
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive B-OP
. O

He O
not O
only O
makes O
his O
own O
homemade B-OP
mozzarella B-AS
, O
but O
every O
pie B-AS
is O
ultra B-OP
fresh I-OP
. O

Fish B-AS
was O
overdone B-OP
. O

Great B-OP
idea I-OP
and O
base O
for O
restaurant B-AS
, O
but O
work O
on O
the O
details O
, O
people O
who O
think O
this O
was O
good O
need O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
shore O
towns O
and O
rethink O
what O
it O
should O
have O
tasted O
like O
. O

When O
you O
re O
sitting O
in O
their O
main O
dining O
room O
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular B-OP
, I-OP
hand-painted I-OP
high I-OP
ceiling B-AS
) O
you O
d O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

We O
visited O
Bread O
Bar O
during O
January O
restaurant O
week O
and O
were O
so B-OP
pleased I-OP
with O
the O
menu B-AS
selections I-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music O
being O
piped O
in O
- O
quite O
a O
weird B-OP
selection B-AS
. O

You O
could B-OP
get I-OP
a I-OP
much I-OP
better I-OP
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
for O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
French O
Bistros O
. O

The O
establishment B-AS
scores B-OP
big I-OP
points I-OP
in O
presentation B-AS
and O
style B-AS
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
though O
pricey B-OP
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

Good B-OP
food B-AS
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very B-OP
friendly I-OP
, O
if O
not B-OP
overly I-OP
efficient I-OP
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
however O
was O
very B-OP
good I-OP
. O

It O
s O
better B-OP
than I-OP
being I-OP
on I-OP
the B-AS
roof I-AS
of I-AS
Sutton I-AS
Place I-AS
with O
19 O
year O
old O
interns O
jabbing O
you O
in O
the O
ribs B-AS
all B-OP
night I-OP
. O

Service B-AS
has O
always B-OP
been I-OP
friendly I-OP
and I-OP
efficient I-OP
. O

Went O
there O
and O
had O
a O
combination O
of O
different O
seafood O
dishes O
and O
appetizers O
. O

Its O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
for I-AS
a I-AS
casual I-AS
date I-AS
or O
to B-AS
entertain I-AS
clients I-AS
for I-AS
lunch I-AS
. O

All O
we O
received O
was O
an O
apology O
as O
we O
left O
to O
see O
our O
show O
without O
dinner O
. O

The O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
if O
he O
crushed O
the O
grapes O
himself O
when O
their O
long B-OP
overdue I-OP
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
finally O
arrived O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
very B-OP
good I-OP
. O

We O
could B-OP
not I-OP
catch I-OP
our O
waiter B-AS
s O
eye O
, O
and O
he O
ignored O
us O
. O

Fantastic B-OP
place B-AS
. O

Plain O
and O
simple O
it O
s O
bad B-OP
thai B-AS
food I-AS
. O

Definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant O
to O
skip O
! O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

Usually O
3 O
vs. O
4 O
items O
per O
dish O
. O

While O
certain O
staples B-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
( O
the O
burger O
, O
some O
of O
the O
pastas O
) O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
not B-OP
really I-OP
the I-OP
point I-OP
. O

The O
Dim B-AS
Sum I-AS
was O
so-so B-OP
, O
but O
not B-OP
spectacular I-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
so-so B-OP
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more B-OP
concerned I-OP
of I-OP
looking I-OP
good I-OP
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
larger B-OP
than O
most O
and O
features O
adequate B-OP
seating B-AS
unlike O
most O
joints O
, O
and O
has O
a O
bar B-AS
which O
deserves B-OP
a I-OP
mention I-OP
. O

What O
a O
ripoff O
! O

Threw O
my O
fiance O
s O
surprise O
30th O
birthday O
dinner B-AS
here O
could B-OP
n't I-OP
be I-OP
happier I-OP

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

Food-awesome O
. O

good B-OP
music B-AS
, O
great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
speedy B-OP
service B-AS
affordable B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
small B-OP
wait B-AS
, O
but O
shorter B-OP
than I-OP
I I-OP
expected I-OP
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
$ B-OP
24 I-OP
and O
although O
it O
was O
good B-OP
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

May O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
always B-OP
has I-OP
a I-OP
smile I-OP
on O
her O
and O
will B-OP
warmly I-OP
greet B-AS
you I-AS
. O

I O
ve O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place O
has O
it O
all O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel O
s O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

The O
sides B-AS
were O
ok B-OP
and O
incredibly B-OP
salty I-OP
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
all O
the O
seafood B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
menu I-AS
was O
unavailable B-OP
except O
for O
the O
Salmon O
. O

Not B-OP
a I-OP
large I-OP
place B-AS
, O
but O
it O
s O
cute B-OP
and O
cozy B-OP
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

and O
there O
s O
no O
way O
out O
. O

The O
beverages B-AS
were O
excellent B-OP
, O
and O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly B-OP
rude I-OP
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple B-OP
Asian B-AS
appetizers I-AS
and O
drinks B-AS
. O

Please O
if O
your O
thinking O
about O
it O
go O
, O
and O
stay O
the O
wait B-AS
you O
wo B-OP
n't I-OP
be I-OP
disappointed I-OP
. O

I O
must O
say O
the O
view B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS
is O
so B-OP
beautiful I-OP
! O

If O
you O
d O
like O
to O
have O
a O
nice B-OP
light I-OP
meal B-AS
with O
an O
asian O
accent O
, O
Long O
Tan O
is O
a O
good B-OP
place B-AS
on O
the O
slope O
. O

When O
going O
out O
for O
a O
nice B-OP
dinner B-AS
, O
I O
like O
a O
nice B-OP
ambiance B-AS
as O
well O
as O
very B-OP
good I-OP
food B-AS
. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
this O
place O
has O
great B-OP
service B-AS
and O
prices B-AS
and O
a O
nice B-OP
friendly I-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Highly B-OP
recommend B-AS
this O
as O
great B-OP
value B-AS
for O
excellent B-OP
sushi B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much B-OP
better I-OP
served B-AS
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service O
. O

A++ O
The O
service B-AS
was O
good B-OP
to O
excellent B-OP
along O
with O
the O
attitude B-AS
. O

This O
is O
my O
fourth O
try O
over O
a O
two O
year O
period O
, O
and O
I O
m O
done O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
awesome B-OP
- O
definitely O
try O
the O
striped B-AS
bass I-AS
. O

The O
music B-AS
does O
get O
a O
little B-OP
loud I-OP
at O
times O
, O
but O
it O
just O
made O
me O
want O
to O
lean O
closer O
to O
my O
beautiful O
wife O
, O
and O
as O
I O
did O
, O
I O
got O
a O
whiff O
of O
corriander O
. O

black B-AS
white I-AS
shakes I-AS
came O
out O
good B-OP
also O
. O

It O
s O
simply O
the O
best B-OP
meal B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

The O
seating O
was O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O
people O
into O
the O
restaurant O
, O
so O
be O
nice O
to O
your O
neighbor O
when O
you O
dine O
here O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
chu O
chu O
curry O
and O
my O
friend O
ordered O
the O
pad O
thai O
chicken O
. O

We O
go O
on O
Mondays O
for O
the O
prix O
fixe O
and O
our O
experience O
with O
the O
food B-AS
has O
been O
comparable B-OP
to I-OP
Blue I-OP
Ribbon I-OP
. O

Tuk O
Tuk O
is O
my O
second B-OP
favorite I-OP
neighborhood I-OP
Thai B-AS
place I-AS
( O
the O
first O
being O
Joya O
) O
. O

However O
, O
they O
ve O
got O
the O
most B-OP
amazing I-OP
pastrami B-AS
and O
the O
soups B-AS
hit B-OP
the I-OP
spot I-OP
. O

Great B-OP
bagels B-AS
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really B-OP
good I-OP
, O
inexpensive B-OP
sushi B-AS
. O

my O
personal O
favorite B-OP
is O
an O
everything O
bagel B-AS
with I-AS
lox I-AS
spread I-AS
, O
but O
all O
the O
bagles B-AS
are O
unbeliavably B-OP
good I-OP
. O

I O
would O
n't O
even O
have O
complained O
at O
all O
if O
the O
food O
at O
least O
tasted O
good O
but O
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
was O
crappy B-OP
, O
too O
. O

For O
the O
next O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
we O
stood O
in O
the O
crowded B-OP
lobby B-AS
area I-AS
of O
this O
touristy B-OP
restaurant B-AS
listening O
to O
all O
types O
of O
explanations O
of O
why O
we O
were O
not O
being O
seated O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest B-OP
in O
NYC O
. O

Also O
good B-OP
for I-OP
client B-AS
lunch I-AS
meetings I-AS
, O
esp O
. O

For O
$ O
600 O
( O
the O
most O
we O
have O
ever O
paid O
) O
not O
even O
waving O
a O
magic O
wand O
will O
ever O
get O
us O
back O
for O
a O
repeat O
performance O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
dark B-OP
, O
cool B-OP
and O
soothing B-OP
, O
while O
the O
food B-AS
s I-AS
presentation I-AS
is O
spectacular B-OP
, O
considering O
the O
low B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

The O
Waitstaff B-AS
were O
very B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
suggested O
swordfish O
for O
my O
husband O
he O
enjoyed B-OP
his O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual B-OP
and O
romantic B-OP
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible B-OP
management B-AS
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down O
. O

Great B-OP
friendly I-OP
service B-AS
, O
Fast B-OP
seating B-AS
, O
Fast B-OP
Delivery B-AS
, O
Excellent B-OP
sushi B-AS
. O

The O
desserts B-AS
are O
more O
appealing B-OP
then O
stuffy O
overpriced O
French O
restaurants O
. O

The O
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
has O
flavor B-AS
( O
that O
can O
be O
sort O
of O
surprising B-OP
on O
the O
UES O
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
turns O
from O
a O
nightmare O
to O
attentive B-OP
, O
they O
sort O
of O
remind O
me O
of O
the O
NY O
Yankees O
of O
the O
late O
90 O
s O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
bad B-OP
it O
look B-AS
, O
you O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
rally O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
... O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order B-AS
is O
often O
slow B-OP
to I-OP
arrive I-OP
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
TRUE O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
outstanding B-OP
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
I O
had O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative B-OP
and O
unique B-OP
rolls B-AS
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

The O
New O
York O
Times O
has O
reviewed O
this O
place O
three O
times O
already O
, O
you O
know O
it O
s O
going O
to O
be O
good O
. O

Baluchi O
s O
has O
solid B-OP
food B-AS
and O
a O
nice B-OP
decor B-AS
at O
reasonable B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

Emilio O
, O
the O
owner O
, O
is O
often O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
table O
greeting O
guests O
as O
they O
come O
and O
go O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
spice O
three O
times- O
twice O
during O
lunch O
and O
once O
at O
dinner O
. O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent B-OP
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY B-OP
salty I-OP
! O

I O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
expecting O
to O
be O
surprised O
but O
left O
bored B-OP
and O
overcharged B-OP
. O

A O
cheap B-OP
eat B-AS
for O
NYC O
, O
but O
not O
for O
dosa O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy B-OP
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking B-OP
around I-OP
doing O
things O
as O
fast B-OP
as O
they O
can O
. O

The O
seafood B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
, O
there O
s O
a O
good B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing B-OP
menu B-AS
always O
offers O
some O
great B-OP
surprises B-AS
. O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines O
. O

Pastrami B-AS
or I-AS
corned I-AS
beef I-AS
are O
juicy B-OP
and O
piled B-OP
high I-OP
( O
ask O
for O
extra B-OP
rye B-AS
bread I-AS
) O
. O

( O
$ B-OP
200 I-OP
for I-OP
2 I-OP

not B-OP
too I-OP
expensive I-OP
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
2 O
after B-AS
dinner I-AS
drinks I-AS
) O
. O

Really O
though O
, O
where O
s O
the O
seasoning O
? O

The O
food B-AS
was O
just B-OP
OK I-OP
, O
at O
least O
for O
what O
food O
was O
available O
. O

by O
dinner O
time O
, O
they O
turn O
it O
around O
and O
mount O
a O
huge O
comeback O
! O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very B-OP
patient I-OP
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal B-OP
! O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
, O
but O
service B-AS
was B-OP
n't I-OP
so I-OP
great I-OP
. O

Solid B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
knowledgeable B-OP
staff B-AS
, O
friendly B-OP
owners B-AS
and O
an O
adventurous B-OP
, O
ever-changing B-OP
menu B-AS
keep O
us O
coming O
back O
. O

The O
people B-AS
that O
work O
there O
are O
always B-OP
so I-OP
friendly I-OP
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
even O
see O
a O
menu O
, O
as O
our O
waiter O
described O
both O
the O
specials O
and O
the O
main O
dishes O
. O

The O
location B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
Ok B-OP
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
what B-OP
makes I-OP
up I-OP
for I-OP
it O
. O

otherwise O
, O
good B-OP
stuff B-AS
for O
late B-OP
nite I-OP
eats B-AS
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
was O
ok B-OP
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

Its O
not O
the O
same O
if O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
inside O
. O

I O
love B-OP
and O
I O
know O
gourmet B-AS
food I-AS
by O
excellence O
! O

I O
plan O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
trying O
their O
assortment B-OP
of I-OP
bruschetta B-AS
, O
panini B-AS
s O
... O
.. O

Great B-OP
people B-AS
watching O
as O
others O
do O
the O
same O
to O
you O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
just O
an O
unintentional B-OP
mistake B-AS
but O
I O
ve O
experienced O
the O
same O
with O
other O
restaurants O
so O
I O
do B-OP
n't I-OP
appreciate I-OP
such O
practice B-AS
. O

Two O
people O
in O
our O
party O
felt O
like O
something O
else O
, O
and O
Volare O
immediately O
obliged O
with O
two O
great B-OP
dishes B-AS
that O
were O
not O
in O
their O
regular O
menu O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar B-OP
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
remembers O
me O
and O
is O
very B-OP
friendly I-OP
, O
she O
knows O
what O
my O
regular O
is O
and O
that O
s O
the O
fried O
mini O
buns O
with O
the O
condensed O
milk O
and O
the O
assorted O
fruits O
on O
beancurd O
. O

I O
m O
going O
back O
. O

Diner B-OP
food B-AS
at O
bistro O
prices B-AS
is O
a O
bummer B-OP
... O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
been O
going O
here O
regularly O
for O
two O
years O
. O

wow O
! O
how O
have O
i O
missed O
this O
one O
, O
tried O
Long O
Tan O
last O
week O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
now O
know O
what O
the O
NY O
TIMES O
and O
many O
more O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
already O
knew O
. O

Go O
there O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
leave O
feeling O
like O
a O
baby O
Veal O
Calf O
( O
ok O
bad O
joke O
) O
, O
but O
you O
will O
see O
. O

While O
we O
thoroughly B-OP
enjoyed I-OP
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
was O
annoying B-OP
to O
scream B-AS
across O
the O
table O
for O
conversation O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding B-OP
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large B-OP
and O
the O
servers B-AS
always B-OP
surprise I-OP
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

delicious B-OP
bagels B-AS
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

Ive O
passed O
by O
the O
spot O
tons O
of O
times O
always O
wanting O
to O
go O
in O
. O

All O
the O
food B-AS
was O
hot B-OP
tasty I-OP
. O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

This O
is O
one O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
eat O
pizza B-AS
more O
out O
but O
not B-OP
a I-OP
good I-OP
place B-AS
for I-AS
take-out I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very B-OP
helpful I-OP
and I-OP
friendly I-OP
. O

Try O
green O
curry O
with O
vegetables O
. O

Would O
recommend B-OP
this O
place B-AS
as O
a O
good B-OP
date B-AS
spot I-AS
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
drop O
a O
ton O
of O
cash O
. O

While O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
happens O
all O
the O
time-this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
treatment O
that O
buys O
repeat O
business O
! O

This O
place O
was O
not O
ALL O
THAT O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
*not* B-OP
romantic I-OP
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
s O
editorial O
review O
. O

The O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy B-OP
vault I-OP
like I-OP
door B-AS
, O
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O
. O

Much O
more O
reasonably B-OP
priced B-AS
too O
! O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great B-OP
Italian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
, O
drive O
to O
Corona O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not B-OP
very I-OP
tasty I-OP
, O
the O
portioins B-AS
were O
tiny B-OP
even O
for O
such O
a O
high B-OP
quality I-OP
restaurant B-AS
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Others O
have O
to O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants O
and O
feel O
sad O
until O
they O
re O
eaten O
. O

Why O
make O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
are O
n't O
going O
to O
keep O
it O
? O

The O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
here O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Big B-OP
and O
gawky B-OP
on O
the O
outside B-AS
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Mary O
s O
many O
times O
and O
I O
like O
it O
. O

Searching O
to O
get O
out O
from O
the O
cold O
, O
freezing O
weather O
, O
we O
went O
into O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
a O
deli O
. O

I O
do O
not B-OP
recommend I-OP
lunch B-AS
specials I-AS
just O
because O
it O
tasts O
the O
same O
with O
other O
regular O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
in O
Soho O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
had O
a O
pleasant B-OP
experience B-AS
. O

We O
parked O
on O
the O
block O
of O
Nina O
s O
the O
place B-AS
looked O
nice B-OP
, O
with O
people O
obviously O
enjoying B-OP
their O
pizzas B-AS
. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

For O
$ O
760 O
for O
2 O
people O
, O
it O
s O
a O
once B-OP
in I-OP
a I-OP
lifetime I-OP
experience B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
o.k. B-OP
, O
but O
not B-OP
any I-OP
better I-OP
than O
what O
you O
get O
at O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
restaurant O
. O

We O
had O
the O
pot-stickers B-AS
which O
were O
great B-OP
and O
a O
tempura B-AS
dish I-AS
that O
was O
great B-OP
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff B-AS
was O
better B-OP
than I-OP
Disney I-OP
. O

After O
reading O
the O
good B-OP
reviews B-AS
of O
this O
restaurant O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
with O
two O
friends O
. O

While O
the O
$ O
20 O
entree B-AS
range I-AS
is O
not B-OP
overly I-OP
expensive I-OP
, O
in O
New O
York O
City O
, O
there O
is O
definitely O
better B-OP
food B-AS
in I-AS
that I-AS
range I-AS
, O
and O
so O
Sapphire O
, O
despite O
it O
s O
lovely B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
will O
most O
likely O
not O
be O
a O
restaurant O
to O
which O
I O
will O
return O
. O

Orsay O
, O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
values B-AS
for O
authentic B-OP
French B-AS
food I-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
had O
been O
searching O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
restaurant B-AS
in O
New O
York O
where O
I O
could O
really O
feel O
unwanted O
and O
ignored O
and O
I O
finally O
found O
it O
! O

It O
s O
definately O
not B-OP
a I-OP
place I-OP
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to B-AS
impress I-AS
someone I-AS
. O

Well O
, O
their O
deliveries B-AS
take B-OP
for I-OP
ever I-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
usually B-OP
cold I-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
no B-OP
nonsense I-OP
. O

Chinese O
Desserts O
are O
known O
for O
healthful O
benefits O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
sweetness O
. O

Wonderful B-OP
at O
holiday B-AS
time I-AS
. O

And O
really B-OP
large I-OP
portions B-AS
. O

The O
place O
is O
a B-OP
lot I-OP
of I-OP
fun B-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
great B-OP
Thai B-AS
restaurant I-AS
with O
a O
very B-OP
friendly I-OP
staff B-AS
. O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B-AS
House I-AS
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
s O
always B-OP
good I-OP
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
and O
roe B-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
off B-OP
flavor I-OP
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed B-OP
with I-OP
the I-OP
food B-AS
. O

I O
recommend B-OP
the O
garlic B-AS
shrimp I-AS
, O
okra B-AS
( I-AS
bindi I-AS
) I-AS
, O
and O
anything O
with O
lamb B-AS

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so B-OP
amazed I-OP
at I-OP
this B-AS
place I-AS
. O

To O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
good O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
to O
Ping O
s O
three O
weekends O
in O
a O
row O
! O
! O
! O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
re O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
was O
impressive B-OP
with O
selections O
ranging O
from O
a O
burger O
, O
to O
steak O
, O
to O
escargot O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
two O
people O
could O
really O
share O
one O
plate O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
authentic B-OP
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
ll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

during O
happy O
hour O
! O

Good B-OP
for I-OP
casual B-AS
dinner I-AS
with O

, O
the O

is O
good B-OP
, O
the O
price B-AS
is O
right B-OP
and O
they O
have O
a O
decent B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

Go O
, O
go O
, O
hurry O
, O
before O
everyone O
finds O
out O
about O
it O
. O

Prices B-AS
are O
higher B-OP
to O
dine O
in O
and O
their O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
marsala I-AS
is O
quite B-OP
good I-OP
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O

time O
. O

This O
place O
has O
many O
different B-OP
styles B-AS
of I-AS
pizza I-AS
and O
they O
are O
all O
amazing B-OP
. O

The O
photos O
of O
the O
restaurant O
in O
its O
web O
site O
are O
way O
better B-OP
than I-OP
the O
real B-AS
look I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
lousy B-OP
- O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
or O
too B-OP
salty I-OP
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny B-OP
. O

But O
the O
coconut B-AS
rice I-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

It O
took O
them O
25 B-OP
minutes I-OP
to I-OP
bring I-OP
our O
appetizer B-AS
. O

A O
guaranteeed B-OP
delight B-AS
! O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
this O
neighborhood B-OP
spot B-AS
for O
years O

Overall B-AS
I O
would O
recommend B-OP
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

Pair O
you O
food O
with O
the O
excellent B-OP
beers B-AS
on I-AS
tap I-AS
or O
their O
well B-OP
priced I-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music O
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at B-OP
least I-OP
100 I-OP
dollar I-OP
bottle B-AS
minimun I-AS
then O
you O
ll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

All O
of O
my O
co-workers O
stated O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
and O
wondered O
why O
they O
had O
n't O
heard O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Anyway O
, O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
cross O
the O
williamsburg O
. O

Metrazur O
has O
a O
beautiful B-OP
spot B-AS
overlooking B-OP
the O
main B-AS
terminal I-AS
. O

Friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy B-OP
your O
meal B-AS
and O
the O
company O
you O
re O
with O
. O

When O
I O
m O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
s O
. O

Guess O
the O
555Soul O
ads O
did O
n't O
launch O
her O
big O
modeling O
career O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
rather B-OP
small I-OP
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
quickly B-OP
. O

Besides O
, O
we O
were O
on O
vacation O
! O

I O
love O
this O
cozy B-OP
around O
the O
way O
Rest B-AS
. O

Quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
and O
price B-AS
is O
cheap B-OP
, O
stick O
to O
pork O
, O
fish O
, O
chicken O
, O
lamb O
and O
vegetables O
. O

Do O
n't O
leave O
without O
trying O
One O
Night O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

This O
is O
my O
favorite B-OP
Italian B-AS
restaurant I-AS
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a B-OP
little I-OP
tight I-OP
and O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
, O
the O
seating B-AS
by O
the O
entranceway O
can O
be O
pretty B-OP
drafty I-OP
. O

The O
appetizing B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable B-OP
price B-AS
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
) O
. O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too B-OP
big I-OP
for O
the O
bun B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
fresh B-OP
, O
delicious B-OP
, O
and O
reasonably B-OP
priced I-OP
. O

Raga O
stands O
out O
with O
an O
interesting B-OP
fusion B-AS
of I-AS
French I-AS
and I-AS
Indian I-AS
cooking I-AS
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip O
cake O
, O
roast O
pork O
buns O
and O
egg O
custards O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
are O
fabulous B-OP
. O

Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
they O
lie O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
claiming O
they O
have O
seating O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
then O
of O
course O
the O
seats B-AS
are O
not B-OP
available I-OP
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good B-OP
and O
overall B-AS
very B-OP
relaxing I-OP
to O
place O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very B-OP
good I-OP
, O
a O
great B-OP
deal B-AS
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
its O
self O
was O
great B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
options I-AS
rule B-OP
. O

A O
great B-OP
choice B-AS
at I-AS
any I-AS
cost I-AS
and O
a O
great B-OP
deal B-AS
. O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

We O
ate O
here O
in O
March O
, O
2006 O
and O
ordered O
the O
pre-theatre O
3-course O
dinner O
with O
wine O
flight O
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

Probably O
much O
busier B-OP
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
it O
s O
seldom B-OP
crowded I-OP
for O
dinner B-AS
( O
too O
close O
to O
downtown O
) O
. O

Their O
calzones B-AS
are O
horrific B-OP
, O
bad B-OP
, O
vomit-inducing B-OP
, O
YUCK B-OP
. O

It O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
a O
drink O
and O
they O
almost O
always O
forget O
to O
bring O
something O
( O
although O
they O
dont O
forget O
to O
charge O
you O
for O
it O
. O

The O
place B-AS
itself O
is O
beautiful B-OP
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
happening B-OP
. O
