I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
Sophia O
pizza O
. O

As O
we O
were O
sitting O
eating O
the O
subpar O
food O
the O
manager O
proceeded O
to O
berate O
a O
couple O
of O
his O
employees O
for O
putting O
out O
the O
wrong B-OP
containers B-AS
for I-AS
condiments I-AS
and O
explained O
to O
them O
how O
expensive B-OP
these O
containers B-AS
were O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
popular B-OP
with I-OP
families I-OP
, O
so O
if O
you O
re O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
, O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O

black B-AS
white I-AS
shakes I-AS
came O
out O
good B-OP
also O
. O

My O
first O
time O
there O

I O
happened O
not B-OP
to I-OP
like I-OP
the O
Crab B-AS
Croquette I-AS
apt I-AS
that O
i O
ordered O
and O
they O
were O
happy O
to O
change O
it O
for O
me O
without O
making O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
aforementioned B-OP
line B-AS
was O
. O

I O
am O
completely B-OP
hooked I-OP
on O
this O
place B-AS
, O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete B-OP
hole B-AS
in I-AS
the I-AS
wall I-AS
, O
it O
s O
a B-OP
bit I-OP
intimidating I-OP
at O
first O
, O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
welcomes O
you O
- O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
. O

It O
s O
constantly B-OP
open B-AS
, O
catering O
to O
the O
Pakistani O
cabbies O
lined O
up O
on O
Crosby O
St. O
, O
so O
there O
s O
more O
turnover O
with O
the O
food B-AS
than O
you O
d O
expect O
( O
i.e. O
, O
surprisingly B-OP
fresh I-OP
) O
. O

For O
$ O
600 O
( O
the O
most O
we O
have O
ever O
paid O
) O
not O
even O
waving O
a O
magic O
wand O
will O
ever O
get O
us O
back O
for O
a O
repeat O
performance O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming B-OP
factor O
was O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
above B-OP
average I-OP
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O
. O

I O
m O
going O
back O
. O

David O
, O
Daytona O

Beach O
, O

FL O

The O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
however O
was O
very B-OP
good I-OP
. O

Did O
I O
mention O
the O
wine O
? O

and O
for O
this O
i O
had O
to O
shell O
out O
a O
small O
fortune O
? O

Where O
Gabriela O
personaly O
greets O
you O
and O
recommends O
you O
what O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
m O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

I O
was O
at O
Rao O
s O
last O

Wed O
. O

Why O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
if O
you O
are O
n't O
going O
to O
keep O
it O
? O

As O
a O

Japanese O
native O
, O

I O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O

I O
was O
just O
so B-OP
amazed I-OP
at I-OP
this B-AS
place I-AS
. O

Super B-OP
friendly I-OP
and I-OP
knowledgable I-OP
staff B-AS
, O
fabulous B-OP
bistro B-AS
fare I-AS
and O
a O
wonderful B-OP
jazz B-AS
brunch I-AS
with O
great B-OP
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
( O
the O
chilaquiles B-AS
were O
awesome B-OP
! O

They O
are O
tasty B-OP
, O
but O

I O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat B-AS
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O

American O
digestive O
system O
. O

The O
fried B-AS
rice I-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
here O
. O

We O
generally O
like O
good O
restaurants O
and O
eat O
out O
often O
but O

Kai B-AS
was O
way B-OP
to I-OP
expensive I-OP
for O
what O
we O
got O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

Big B-OP
and O
gawky B-OP
on O
the O
outside B-AS
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight B-OP
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
perfect B-OP
since O

I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow B-OP
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
no B-OP
nonsense I-OP
. O

With O
the O
theater B-AS
2 B-OP
blocks I-OP
away I-OP
we O
had O
a O
delicious B-OP
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful B-OP
room B-AS
. O

Heartland O
Brewery O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
places B-AS
in O

NYC O
to O
make O
new O
friends O
and O
catch O
up O
with O
old O
ones O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
pizza I-AS
is O
sooo B-OP
good I-OP
with O
garlic B-AS
and O
fresh B-AS
tomatoes I-AS
and O
they O
do O
n't O
skimp O
. O

Try O
the O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
too O
, O
they O
re O
snappy B-OP
and O
delicious B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
reasonably B-OP
priced B-AS
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed B-OP
. O

I O
got O
enough O
reasons O
to O
keep O
coming O
back O
! O
! O
! O

Food B-AS
was O
average B-OP
and O
creme B-AS
brulee I-AS
was O
awful B-OP
- O
the O
sugar B-AS
was O
charred B-OP
, O
not B-OP
caramelized I-OP
and O
smelled B-OP
of I-OP
kerosene I-OP
. O

Nice B-OP
restaurant B-AS
overall O
, O
with O
classic B-OP
upscale I-OP

Italian B-AS
decor I-AS
. O

Spice O
is O
great B-OP

Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
love O
the O
inexpensive B-OP
appetizers B-AS
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O
enjoy B-OP
it O
, O
all O

I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

I O
had O
been O
searching O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
restaurant B-AS
in O

New O
York O
where O

I O
could O
really O
feel O
unwanted B-OP
and O
ignored B-OP
and O

I O
finally O
found O
it O
! O

Succulent B-AS
steaks I-AS
cooked B-OP
precisely I-OP
to O
your O
desired B-OP
doneness B-AS

Ess-A-Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best B-OP
bagel B-AS
in O

NY O
. O

Nicky O
the O

Nose O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
is O
a O
treat O
. O

The O
seats B-AS
are O
uncomfortable B-OP
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

This O
place O
has O
many O
different B-OP
styles B-AS
of I-AS
pizza I-AS
and O
they O
are O
all O
amazing B-OP
. O

It O
s O
a O
rather O
cramped B-OP
and O
busy B-OP
restaurant B-AS
and O
it O
closes B-AS
early B-OP
. O

After O
really O
enjoying B-OP
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table B-AS
and O
had O
dinner B-AS
. O

The O
music B-AS
does O
get O
a O
little B-OP
loud I-OP
at O
times O
, O
but O
it O
just O
made O
me O
want O
to O
lean O
closer O
to O
my O
beautiful O
wife O
, O
and O
as O

I O
did O
, O

I O
got O
a O
whiff O
of O
corriander O
. O

The O
soup B-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
udon I-AS
was O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
water B-AS
. O

What O
came O
to O
our O
table O
was O
burned O
beyond O
recognition O
and O
stringy O
. O

A O
cheap B-OP
eat B-AS
for O

NYC O
, O
but O
not B-OP
for I-OP
dosa I-OP
. O

Ambiance- B-AS
relaxed B-OP
and O
stylish B-OP
. O

OU O
MUST O

TRY O
THIS O

RESTAURANT O
. O

If O
that O
s O
a O
problem O
, O
go O
to O

McDonald O
s O
and O
destroy O
your O
insides O
. O

Fish B-AS
was O
overdone B-OP
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
here O
unless O
you O
re O
starving O
for O
thai O
food O
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O
. O

I O
work O
near-by O
, O
and O
they O
have O
the O

BEST B-OP
oatmeal B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood- O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick-cooked O
item O
. O

Well O
, O
their O
deliveries B-AS
take O
for O
ever O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
usually B-OP
cold I-OP
. O

Emilio O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
, O
is O
often O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
table O
greeting O
guests O
as O
they O
come O
and O
go O
. O

Overall B-AS
I O
would O
recommend B-OP
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

I O
was O
back-to-back B-OP
with O
the O
diner B-AS
at O
the O
table O
behind O
me O
and O
wait O
staff O
had O
to O
hoist O
trays O
over O
our O
heads O
as O
they O
squeezed O
past O
us O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Deep B-AS
Fried I-AS
Skewers I-AS
are O
good B-OP
and O
still O
rare B-OP
to I-OP
find I-OP
in I-OP

NYC I-OP
. O

Great B-OP
bagels B-AS
, O
spreads B-AS
and O
a O
good B-OP
place B-AS
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

Its O
not O
the O
same O
if O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
inside O
. O

I O
was O
pretty O
much O
full B-OP
after I-OP
our O
fondue B-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

I O
was O
glad O

I O
did O
. O

I O
m O
from O

England O
, O
and O
Haru O
s O
was O
the O
best O

I O
had O
in O

NYC O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awful B-OP
. O

The O
sides B-AS
were O
ok B-OP
and O
incredibly B-OP
salty I-OP
. O

This O
should O
have O
been O
done O
in O
a O
back O
room O
- O
away O
from O
customers O
. O

All O
of O
my O
co-workers O
stated O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
and O
wondered O
why O
they O
had O
n't O
heard O
about O
this O
place O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
give O
us O
the O
dinner B-AS
special I-AS
until O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
value O
joint O
. O

Went O
inside B-AS
and O

I O
started O
to O
get O
excited B-OP
. O

Not B-OP
a I-OP
large I-OP
place B-AS
, O
but O
it O
s O
cute B-OP
and O
cozy B-OP
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
too O
! O

Dip O
the O
ingredients O
in O
with O
your O
chopsticks O
, O
swirl O
them O
around O
, O
and O
eat O
. O

A O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
Leaping I-AS
Lizard I-AS
, O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
prosecco I-AS
, O
and O
the O
mussels B-AS
had O
everything B-OP
happy I-OP
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
, O
but O
service B-AS
was B-OP
n't I-OP
so I-OP
great I-OP
. O

Suan O
has O
challenged O
this O
loyalty O
. O

The O
sweet B-AS
lassi I-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
as O
was O
the O
lamb B-AS
chettinad I-AS
and O
the O
garlic B-AS
naan I-AS
but O
the O
rasamalai B-AS
was O
forgettable B-OP
. O

The O
owner B-AS
truly B-OP
caters I-OP
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

I O
m O
told O
that O
it O
is O
open B-AS
24hrs I-OP
which O
is O
good O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
was O
awful B-OP
! O

VT O
is O
what O
baby B-OP
pizzas B-AS
hope O
to O
be O
when O
they O
grow O
up O
. O

We O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
. O

Planet B-AS
Thai I-AS
is O
great B-OP
! O

too B-OP
large I-OP
for I-OP
just O
two B-AS
people I-AS
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable B-OP
and O
unobtrusive B-OP
-- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
know O
their O
menu B-AS
, O
present O
your O
meal B-AS
, O
and O
attend B-OP
to I-OP
your B-AS
needs I-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite B-OP
restaurants B-AS
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

Great B-OP
bagels B-AS
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O
. O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-AS

Salmon I-AS
, O

Sea B-AS
Bass I-AS
and O
Crispy B-AS

Duck I-AS
. O

We O
were O
n't O
! O

I O
have O

NEVER O
been O
disappointed B-OP
in O
the O

Red O
Eye O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O

I O
recently O
had O
an O
early B-OP
dinner B-AS
at O
Artisanal O
and O
was O
satisfied B-OP
with O
our O
experience B-AS
. O

Other O
than O
the O
crappy B-OP
service B-AS
from O
two O
individuals O
, O
it O
s O
great B-OP
. O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O

Leon O
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite B-OP
the O
gem B-AS

BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

Sexy O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best B-OP
thing O
in B-AS
Soho I-AS
. O

The O
website O
and O
rating O
makes O
this O
place B-AS
look B-OP
wonderful I-OP
but O
in O
reality B-AS
it O
was O
very B-OP
disappointing I-OP
. O

Would O
recommend B-OP
this O
place B-AS
as O
a O
good B-OP
date B-AS
spot I-AS
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
drop B-AS
a B-OP
ton I-OP
of I-OP
cash I-OP
. O

We O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O
home O
with O
us O
. O

However O
, O
it O
s O
not B-OP
worth I-OP
a O
special B-AS
trip I-AS
. O

You O
can O
also O
special O
order O
any O
kind O
of O
dumpling B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

The O
food B-AS
now O
is O
inconsistent B-OP
. O

I O
am O
amazed O
by O
the O
poor O
reviews- O

I O
find O
this O
place O
to O
be O
standout B-OP

Italian B-AS
in O
an O
area O
flooded O
with O
Italian- O
great B-OP
prices B-AS
, O
great B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
good B-OP
service B-AS
and O
a O
wonderful B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
dark B-OP
, O
cool B-OP
and O
soothing B-OP
, O
while O
the O
food B-AS
s I-AS
presentation I-AS
is O
spectacular B-OP
, O
considering O
the O
low B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O

I O
moderately B-OP
enjoyed I-OP
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS

Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

May O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
always B-OP
has I-OP
a I-OP
smile I-OP
on O
her O
and O
will B-OP
warmly I-OP
greet B-AS
you I-AS
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O

I O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
, O
but O
definitely B-OP
not I-OP
for I-OP

Dim B-AS
Sum I-AS
again O
. O
